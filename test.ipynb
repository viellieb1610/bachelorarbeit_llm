We made reservations for 10:00pm (you will not be seated until your entire party arrives) we were seated right away. This place is hip. Greatttt DJ had a mix of everything (latin music bachata,merengue,reggaeton,techno,hip hop,pop). Had the appetizers family style and yes i have to agree this plate consists of everything being fried but good! lol had the soup sancocho it was ok. the entree. I had the churrasco (skirt steak) with mash potatoes OMG deeee lish! we ordered a pitcher of red sangria due to the high praise for it on here, but i was sadly dissapointed on that part! : (  wasn't sweet at all! a bit strong.The desserts were great coconut flan, rum raisin bread pudding, guava cheesecake,and a chocolate coffee mousse cake. The decor was so cute orange cushioned leather on one half of wall and hot pink on the other side and rustic chandeliers all over. There was lounge below we didn't go there but doesnt seem like a spot to dance in only to chill without the food. They also offer doggy bags for your left overs! yeaaaah! Overall great place! :)”\n",

With improvements needed in making sure the flavors are different and not copied, it holds to it own standards. However I must say the first time I came I was denied as there was a party scheduled &amp; they refused to serve walk-ins that day. This second time I went I was able to go in and sit down. Due to the catering options not going on during my 2nd visit. The place was nearly empty. The food came out promptly, the service was standard with limited English language. Not enough welcoming vibes. Lead to my final conclusion, if nargis is booked or when they can&#39;t serve parties, come here for little different and unique food  with a more well decorated place, for bigger events!”\n",

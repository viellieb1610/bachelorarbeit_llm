Your task is to classify online text reviews from the movie, series and games rating platform IMDb.
The reviews either contain references to other reviews on IMDb or no references at all.

Reference to other reviews:
    - Explicit mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I read the other reviews", "I have to agree with the other raters")
    - Addressing of other reviews (e.g. "I'm struggling to understand the 10/10 reviews", "All y'all hatin' on the fact you'd probably neva make...")
    - Indirect mentioning of reviews (e.g. "Even though it is not everybody's favorite season, it was still good")
    - Mentioning of review platform (e.g. "This certainly deserves more rating than what IMDB shows")
No references:
    - Solely description of own experience
    - Mentioning or comparison of/to other movies or series (e.g. "the other seasons were better")
    - Referencing own review or personal rating (e.g. "if you read my other reviews")
    - Writes own rating at end of the review (e.g. "...(7/10)")
    - Mentions external critics (e.g. "I have to agree with Roger Ebert")
    - Mentioning of IMDb in another context (e.g. "IMDb labeled this as horror")


Now it's your turn. Answer with "No reference" or "Reference to other reviews".

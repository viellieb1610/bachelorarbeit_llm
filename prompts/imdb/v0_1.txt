Your task is to classify online text reviews from the movie and series rating platform IMDb. The reviews either contain references to other reviews on IMDb or no references at all.
Reference to other reviews:
    - Explicit mentioning of reviews (e.g. "if anyone actually looked at the comments already made about the movie on this website")
    - Indirect mentioning of reviews (e.g. "this movie is a Disney sequel done right!so why do numerous people hate it?")
    - Mentioning of review platform (e.g. "This certainly deserves more rating than what IMDB show")
No references:
    - Solely description of own experience
    - References to other sources than IMDb (e.g. "Good reviews from the movie critics")

Now it's your turn. Answer with "No reference" or "Reference to other reviews".

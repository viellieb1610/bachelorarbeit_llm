Your task is to classify online text reviews from the movie and series rating platform IMDb.
The reviews either contain references to other reviews or ratings on IMDb or no references to other reviews. References are only clear references to imdb reviews or ratings.

Reference to other reviews:
    - Explicit mentioning of reviews (e.g. "if anyone actually looked at the comments already made about the movie on this website")
    - Mentioning of ratings for a movie or series
    - Indirect mentioning of reviews (e.g. "this movie is a Disney sequel done right!so why do numerous people hate it?")
    - Mentioning of review platform (e.g. "This certainly deserves more rating than what IMDB show")
No references:
    - Solely description of own experience
    - References to other sources than IMDb (e.g. "Good reviews from the movie critics")
    - Comparison to other media (e.g. "the plot was the same as xy")
    - Reference to own review (e.g. "if you read my other reviews", "you can find more reviews on my website")
    - Asking other readers how they see it (e.g. "as some will say")
    - Own rating at the end of a review (e.g. "I give it 2/5")
    - Mentioning IMDb in another context (e.g. "IMDb trivia")

Now it's your turn. Answer with "No reference" or "Reference to other reviews".

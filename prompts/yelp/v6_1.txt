Your task is to classify online text reviews from the food rating platform yelp. The reviews either contain references to other reviews on yelp or no references at all.
Reference to other reviews:
    - Explicit mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I read the other reviews", "I have to agree with the other raters")
    - Indirect mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I don't understand the hype")
    - Mentioning of review platform (e.g. "Yelp helped us find this restaurant")
No references:
    - Solely description of own experience
    - Comparison to other restaurants
    - Mentioning of other restaurants (e.g. "it was as good as in place xy")
    - References to other sources than yelp (e.g. "a friend recommended this place")
    - Mentioning of Yelp in another context (e.g. "came here with some friends from yelp")

Now it's your turn. Answer with "No reference" or "Reference to other reviews".

Your task is to classify online text reviews from the food rating platform yelp. The reviews either contain references to other reviews on yelp or no references at all.
Reference to other reviews:
    - Explicit mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I read the other reviews", "I have to agree with the other raters")
    - Indirect mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I don't understand the hype")
    - Mentioning of review platform (e.g. "Yelp helped us find this restaurant")
No references:
    - Solely description of own experience
    - Comparison to other restaurants
    - Mentioning of other restaurants (e.g. "it was as good as in place xy")
    - References to other sources than yelp (e.g. "a friend recommended this place")
    - Mentioning of Yelp in another context (e.g. "came here with some friends from yelp")

Examples:
Input:
"Decided to go here due to great reviews but was not impressed.
Output: Reference to other reviews # mentions "great reviews"

Input:
"After reading all the reviews with less than four stars for ethiopian food in manhattan, I chose Zoma."
Output: Reference to other reviews # read all the reviews with less than four stars

Input:
"What a delight to find this place so close to the theater district but away from the touristy craziness of Times Square (thank you, Yelp, for that!)"
Output: Reference to other reviews # implicit references the reviews and ratings by saying that Yelp helped to find this restaurant

Input:
"Yes, believe the hype. This restaurant lived up to its accolades."
Output: Reference to other reviews # the word hype implies high rating reviews

Input:
"Short version: I've never given such a low rating to a restaurant in Williamsburg"
Output: No reference # doesn't mention other reviews at all and just describe personal experience

Input:
"Their bread is delicious and the pastrami is right up there with Katz&#39;s. If you&#39;re there for lunch and brought an appetite, I highly recommend."
Output: No reference # mentions other restaurant 'Katz's' which isn't a reference to yelp reviews

Input:
"Not the snowdays I remembered it to be in terms of quality (I've been to the Flushing one and the one near NYU), so it's a bit disappointing!"
Output: No reference # mentions other locations which isn't a reference to other reviews

Input:
"As competitors to Nargis and referred by a few clients who said I MUST try it, it was good food!"
Output: No reference # references a recommendation by a client and not yelp

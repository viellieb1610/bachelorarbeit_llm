Your task is to classify online text reviews from the food rating platform yelp. The reviews either contain references to other reviews on yelp or no references at all.
Reference to other reviews:
    - Explicit mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I read the other reviews", "I have to agree with the other raters")
    - Indirect mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I don't understand the hype")
    - Mentioning of review platform (e.g. "Yelp helped us find this restaurant")
No references:
    - Solely description of own experience
    - Mentioning of other restaurants (e.g. "it was as good as in place xy")
    - References to other sources than yelp (e.g. "a friend recommended this place")
    - Mentioning of yelp in another context (e.g. "came here with some friends from yelp")

Examples:
Input:
"Decided to go here due to great reviews but was not impressed. I was looking for a romantic atmosphere to celebrate an anniversary. The decor was pleasant and was quite enough for conversations. Pros are the house roll & pulled pork taco. Cons, slow service, pasta was cold/hard or under cooked, beef tenderloin was ok but expensive. We ended up just wanting to leave. Tip: If you're catching a show in the area and decide to go here, tell the waiter immediately so they will time your dinner accordingly."
Output: Reference to other reviews # mentions "great reviews"

Input:
"Gomen (collard greens), Misir Wett (red split lentils), Buticha (pureed chickpeas) were all delicious. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in the city. After reading all the reviews with less than four stars for ethiopian food in manhattan, I chose Zoma. The environment and mood was comfortable and artful, and so I had to give this a 5 star rating."
Output: Reference to other reviews # read all the reviews with less than four stars

Input:
"What a delight to find this place so close to the theater district but away from the touristy craziness of Times Square (thank you, Yelp, for that!) And such great coffee; I had an iced vanilla latte and it was a great balance of bitter and sweet, and nice and smooth in the coffee taste. I also loved the vibe of the place; it's small, but the people settled in at tables on their laptops seemed happy to stay. Loved the friendly cashiers and baristas as well. I'll be back whenever I need a pick-me-up before seeing a show."
Output: Reference to other reviews # implicit references the reviews and ratings by saying that Yelp helped to find this restaurant

Input:
"Yes, believe the hype. This restaurant lived up to its accolades. Prior to dining here last night I was a bit taken aback by the negative reviews, they are unwarranted. We dine out and good meals deserve praise and sometimes a high sticker price; Cosme included.  Start with a cocktail; we went for the least complicated and extremely delicious Paloma and a Margarita. Served in a large, heavy glass with exactly the right sized ice cubes. Refreshingly tart with the right amount of alcohol. Score 1 for Cosme. Now the food... the great thing about the menu is things are meant to be shared. Although Leon and I don&#39;t eat the same proteins there was plenty to share and we were sooo full. Try the herb Guacamole with these long amazingly, crunchy and Fresh chips. Plenty of heat and avocado. Next up the Cobia al pastor which comes with fresh tortillas so you can make your own tacos. Very healthy serving size. The Pineapple pur√©e with cobia... what was that.... pure Delicious and so Unexpected. Broccoli tamale, a must try. Next up Scallops with jicama. Freshest tasting ever. So clean and crisp with a little heat. Ayacote bean salad with market greens. We have never tasted anything like this lemony, smokey bacon flavor bomb. There&#39;s No trace of meat here, just flavor. How can a salad be so complex with heat slowly unwinding with bursts of fresh crunch watermelon radish. The Manouri although delicious, was so different than other dishes our palates were confused by the nod to Mediterranean flavors. Or is it Mexican with med cheese, tilting a Mexican dish on its head. Every dish was perfect and well balanced. Complex combos of acid,heat and salt. Each dish differed from each other but had commonality of complexity.  The ambiance: Energetic and vibrant with a creative playlist. Another nice touch,  All utensils swapped out every course.  And don&#39;t forget desert... the much reported Husk meringue is a must. Light fluffy whipped cream with a salty savory corn mousse. Yes it is a &#34;broken egg&#34;. And delicious. Omg We ate too much, but worth it."
Output: Reference to other reviews # the word hype implies high rating reviews

"Short version: I've never given such a low rating to a restaurant in Williamsburg. The owner was rude to our party of 4 on two occasions, and we waited about 15 minutes to be approached by our server. Once we did order, we received our appetizers after 15 minutes, and our beer after 20 minutes. The only part I actually enjoyed was the fact the the patty of the burger was indeed of high quality. Long version: 1) The restaurant is divided into two sections (seems like two neighboring establishments combined into one). The second room is fully open with a view on the street. We saw a couple of tables available, and went to the entrance of the restaurant to try and grab a seat. We were greeted by the owner, who told us it's not possible to get a table in the second room because he has a large party. We decided to leave (because we didn't like the atmosphere in the first room) , and momentarily were chased down by one of the servers telling us he found us a table. As we entered the second room, we realized that the owner was dishonest about the seat availability, as well as the fact that there wasn't a single party, but different groups of people.  2) The second problem was the long wait time I've mentioned in the short version. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to prepare a pitcher of beer.  3) One of the members of our party attempted to find the restroom. It's located in the area between the two rooms, where the kitchen is located; It's a bit confusing. As she was standing there the owner approached her and asked her what she was looking for. She told him she was looking for the restroom, to which he responded "you shouldn't look for the bathroom, and you should have walked in through the main entrance". I understand that maybe he thought she came off the street to use the restroom, but if you have a terrible field vision within the vicinity of your own business, maybe you should not automatically assume that your PAYING CUSTOMER who's been sitting in your establishment for close to an hour is someone off the street."
Output: No reference # doesn't mention other reviews at all and just describe personal experience

"It&#39;s very hard to beat brunch at High Street on Hudson right now. Everything begins with their bread. High Street&#39;s bread is so fresh and homemade, it truly sets them apart and takes the meal up a notch. I would very rarely pay $4 for a bread selection, but it&#39;s definitely worth it there. <br><br>I&#39;ve been a few times now, but keep gravitating back to the pastrami sandwich if I go for lunch. The rye bread is delicious and the pastrami is right up there with Katz&#39;s. If you&#39;re there for lunch and brought an appetite, I highly recommend. <br><br>Egg dishes are also fantastic too. Great portions and execution. Just an overall 10/10 experience every time there."
Output: No reference # mentions other restaurant 'Katz's' which isn't a reference to yelp reviews

Input:
"Great Decor and layout of the restaurant. The place is well kept. As competitors to Nargis and referred by a few clients who said I MUST try it, it was good food! With improvements needed in making sure the flavors are different and not copied, it holds to it own standards. However I must say the first time I came I was denied as there was a party scheduled &amp; they refused to serve walk-ins that day. This second time I went I was able to go in and sit down. Due to the catering options not going on during my 2nd visit. The place was nearly empty. The food came out promptly, the service was standard with limited English language. Not enough welcoming vibes. Lead to my final conclusion, if nargis is booked or when they can&#39;t serve parties, come here for little different and unique food with a more well decorated place, for bigger events!"
Output: No reference # references a recommendation by a client and not yelp

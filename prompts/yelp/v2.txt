Your task is to classify online text reviews from the food rating platform yelp. The reviews either contain references to other reviews or no references at all.
A reference is defined as direct or indirect mentioning of other reviews, raters or yelp. (e.g. "I read the other reviews", "I have to agree with the other raters")
Reviews that contain no references only describe the own experience or explicit mention other sources than yelp.

Examples:
Input:
"Decided to go here due to great reviews but was not impressed. I was looking for a romantic atmosphere to celebrate an anniversary. The decor was pleasant and was quite enough for conversations. Pros are the house roll & pulled pork taco. Cons, slow service, pasta was cold/hard or under cooked, beef tenderloin was ok but expensive. We ended up just wanting to leave. Tip: If you're catching a show in the area and decide to go here, tell the waiter immediately so they will time your dinner accordingly."
Output: Reference to other reviews # mentions "great reviews"

Input:
"Gomen (collard greens), Misir Wett (red split lentils), Buticha (pureed chickpeas) were all delicious. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in the city. After reading all the reviews with less than four stars for ethiopian food in manhattan, I chose Zoma. The environment and mood was comfortable and artful, and so I had to give this a 5 star rating."
Output: Reference to other reviews # read all the reviews with less than four stars

Input:

"What a delight to find this place so close to the theater district but away from the touristy craziness of Times Square (thank you, Yelp, for that!) And such great coffee; I had an iced vanilla latte and it was a great balance of bitter and sweet, and nice and smooth in the coffee taste. I also loved the vibe of the place; it's small, but the people settled in at tables on their laptops seemed happy to stay. Loved the friendly cashiers and baristas as well. I'll be back whenever I need a pick-me-up before seeing a show."
Output: Reference to other reviews # implicit references the reviews and ratings by saying that Yelp helped to find this restaurant

Input:
"Yes, believe the hype. This restaurant lived up to its accolades. Prior to dining here last night I was a bit taken aback by the negative reviews, they are unwarranted. We dine out and good meals deserve praise and sometimes a high sticker price; Cosme included.  Start with a cocktail; we went for the least complicated and extremely delicious Paloma and a Margarita. Served in a large, heavy glass with exactly the right sized ice cubes. Refreshingly tart with the right amount of alcohol. Score 1 for Cosme. Now the food... the great thing about the menu is things are meant to be shared. Although Leon and I don&#39;t eat the same proteins there was plenty to share and we were sooo full. Try the herb Guacamole with these long amazingly, crunchy and Fresh chips. Plenty of heat and avocado. Next up the Cobia al pastor which comes with fresh tortillas so you can make your own tacos. Very healthy serving size. The Pineapple purée with cobia... what was that.... pure Delicious and so Unexpected. Broccoli tamale, a must try. Next up Scallops with jicama. Freshest tasting ever. So clean and crisp with a little heat. Ayacote bean salad with market greens. We have never tasted anything like this lemony, smokey bacon flavor bomb. There&#39;s No trace of meat here, just flavor. How can a salad be so complex with heat slowly unwinding with bursts of fresh crunch watermelon radish. The Manouri although delicious, was so different than other dishes our palates were confused by the nod to Mediterranean flavors. Or is it Mexican with med cheese, tilting a Mexican dish on its head. Every dish was perfect and well balanced. Complex combos of acid,heat and salt. Each dish differed from each other but had commonality of complexity.  The ambiance: Energetic and vibrant with a creative playlist. Another nice touch,  All utensils swapped out every course.  And don&#39;t forget desert... the much reported Husk meringue is a must. Light fluffy whipped cream with a salty savory corn mousse. Yes it is a &#34;broken egg&#34;. And delicious. Omg We ate too much, but worth it."

"If you do come here, have an open mind. Sure its cheap food but know that it won't be the most pleasant adventure. If you're smart, find someone to order the food for you. Pros: - Really Cheap Food - Compared to restaurants similar to it, there is a lot of seating here - Large drink selection - You get to see those huge sesame pancakes being made in person Cons: - If it's your first time, ordering isn't going to be pleasant. You walk all the way to the end of the store, find the grouchy lady that takes your order and then get pushed by other patrons because like the people that work here, everyones grouchy because it's hot, tight, and sticky everywhere. - It's seriously dirty. I kind of lost my appetite because everything was sticky and greasy. - Really bad service. Even for a Chinese joint. You'll get your money snatched, scowls, ignored, and even yelled at. I understand the style of the business is turning over customers as quick as possible to compensate for the low prices but their rudeness was just unnecessary. But honestly, the service is so bad, my friend and I couldn't help but laugh it off at the end. - The dumplings were surprisingly just ... okay. I was expecting them to be really good because of all the hype and the huge line but they were good at best. Nothing special and nothing worth walking 30 minutes for. Seriously, don't walk 30 minutes to go here, even if you're only spending $6 on dinner. - Bad dumpling sauce. It just soy and vinegar and the sriracha looked so gross. - And seriously, why does Chinatown smell so ... bad? Especially on this street. Not trying to be rude but the stench is almost unbearable especially when its warmer. Conclusion: Lots of cons. Was it worth going? I think so but only if you have an open mind. If you're in the area and you want to do something ridiculous, I say why not? It's so bad, it was almost fun laughing everything off and escaping the smells of Chinatown. But if you're coming all the way from Jersey like I am, you might want to rethink it or at least prepare yourself."

"Short version: I've never given such a low rating to a restaurant in Williamsburg. The owner was rude to our party of 4 on two occasions, and we waited about 15 minutes to be approached by our server. Once we did order, we received our appetizers after 15 minutes, and our beer after 20 minutes. The only part I actually enjoyed was the fact the the patty of the burger was indeed of high quality. Long version: 1) The restaurant is divided into two sections (seems like two neighboring establishments combined into one). The second room is fully open with a view on the street. We saw a couple of tables available, and went to the entrance of the restaurant to try and grab a seat. We were greeted by the owner, who told us it's not possible to get a table in the second room because he has a large party. We decided to leave (because we didn't like the atmosphere in the first room) , and momentarily were chased down by one of the servers telling us he found us a table. As we entered the second room, we realized that the owner was dishonest about the seat availability, as well as the fact that there wasn't a single party, but different groups of people.  2) The second problem was the long wait time I've mentioned in the short version. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to prepare a pitcher of beer.  3) One of the members of our party attempted to find the restroom. It's located in the area between the two rooms, where the kitchen is located; It's a bit confusing. As she was standing there the owner approached her and asked her what she was looking for. She told him she was looking for the restroom, to which he responded "you shouldn't look for the bathroom, and you should have walked in through the main entrance". I understand that maybe he thought she came off the street to use the restroom, but if you have a terrible field vision within the vicinity of your own business, maybe you should not automatically assume that your PAYING CUSTOMER who's been sitting in your establishment for close to an hour is someone off the street."

"Hands down-best coal oven pizza. Everything from the dough to the sauce to the cheese just works. If you watch the pizzaiolos working you can see they love their job as well, &amp; this translates into their pies! We visited 12 pizzerias in 3 days, &amp; once we ate here we knew we were done. This one was the best! Oh so goo!"

"Great Decor and layout of the restaurant. The place is well kept. As competitors to Nargis and referred by a few clients who said I MUST try it, it was good food! With improvements needed in making sure the flavors are different and not copied, it holds to it own standards. However I must say the first time I came I was denied as there was a party scheduled &amp; they refused to serve walk-ins that day. This second time I went I was able to go in and sit down. Due to the catering options not going on during my 2nd visit. The place was nearly empty. The food came out promptly, the service was standard with limited English language. Not enough welcoming vibes. Lead to my final conclusion, if nargis is booked or when they can&#39;t serve parties, come here for little different and unique food with a more well decorated place, for bigger events!"

"I came here because my friend was raving about this place and said this is the closest I'll get to authentic Italian food. I stopped by one Friday night with some friends and I'll definitely be coming back here again! It felt very homey inside and everyone was very friendly. The food took a little longer than I expected but I didn't mind because it was delicious. Can't wait to come back here again! :)"

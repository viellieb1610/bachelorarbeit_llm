Your task is to classify online text reviews from the food rating platform yelp. The reviews either contain references to other reviews on yelp or no references at all.
The only relevant references are to reviews from Yelp itself. Obvious references to other platforms or people do not count.

Reference to other reviews:
    - Explicit mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I read the other reviews", "I have to agree with the other raters")
    - Indirect mentioning of reviews (e.g. "I don't understand the hype", "how can this restaurant be lower than 5 stars")
    - Mentioning of review platform (e.g. "Yelp helped us find this restaurant")
No references:
    - Solely description of own experience
    - Comparison to other restaurants (e.g. "the pastrami is right up there with Katz's")
    - References to other sources than yelp (e.g. "a friend recommended this place", "I heard many things about this eatery")
    - Writing about own review (e.g. "my 5 star review", "as you may have seen in my other reviews")
    - Mentioning of Yelp in another context (e.g. "came here with some friends from yelp", "got some free shots from yelp")

Now it's your turn. Answer with "No reference" or "Reference to other reviews". Quickly explain why you choose your answer.

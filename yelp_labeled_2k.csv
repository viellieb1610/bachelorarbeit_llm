I think my roommates may punch me for only giving them 4 stars, but I just can't justify giving them 5 stars with the wait time + the prices. This pizza is truly superb and absolutely delicious. The hostess didn't have much in the way of a positive attitude, but our servers were wonderful. We put our names in around 6pm and were told to come back at 10. We did, and ended up waiting another half hour before being seated. We ordered two pizzas--one with mushrooms, half pepper and half pepperoni, and the other was a basic margarita with shallots. The total for that? $58. With tip, I think we ended up spending about $70. Two pizzas at $29 each. I'm going to let that sink in. It's a lot! I think they put an entire basil plant on each pizza, but I had no complaints. Basically, was the pizza amazing? Yes. I'd say it's on par with the best I've had, but good lord--that wait? I don't think it justified a 4+ hour wait. I waited for 2 hours for Battersby on a weekend, and that was worth it. To wait twice as long, this would have to be, comparatively, twice as good.

Those who gave this Thai restaurant anything more than 2 stars apparently has never been to Thailand nor tried authentic Thai food (or were just piss drunk when they ate the food). I am of the opinion that if you never traveled to a foreign country and tasted their food, you really shouldn't share your views on Yelp. You guys are just skewing the ratings system. Really, the food here is at best mediocre. Service, well, they managed to screw up my order every time I go. So at least they are consistent. I know, there are so many garbage Asian ""restaurants"" in Manhattan it is hard for those who has never been to Asia to tell the good ones from the bad. So I am going to help you guys out a bit since so many of you can't tell the difference between good and bad Asian food. Often, these restaurants' food has the same quality as McDonald's, but these ""restaurants"" have better furniture and are much more overpriced. I don't know why but you Manhattanites somehow love that combination (ie crappy food, nice decor, and an overpriced menu). As a general rule, you can tell an Asian restaurant has terrible food and is just trying to sell you an image (and not the quality of their food) when you see one or more of the below: 1) Hip, trendy music playing at the restaurant. 2) No (or very few) Asian patrons. Maybe one of two who are just mostly hanging out with their unfortunate non-Asian friends who are about to get ripped off with overpriced and mediocre food, but no groups of Asians (and come on, guys. This is a dead give away. If you haven't figure this one out already then god help you. As a general rule we Asians have a better idea where good Asian food is so you might want to follow us on this one instead of Tom and Dick from Ohio). 3) Food served on over-sized square plates. 4) Over-the-top Buddhism/Hinduism decor. 5) Strong smell of garlic (chef can't cook so he drenched everything in garlic, oil, and MSG and just fried it). For better and authentic Thai food try Jaiya (was there many yrs ago not sure how good they are now) or that little Thai restaurant in Woodside, Queens (right off the 7 train line). Totally forgot the name. Think it starts with an ""S"". Or befriend someone from Thailand and ask them where they go to get good Thai food.

After a search on Yelp exploring the options in the area we decided to try the Mediterranean cooking at Galata two blocks away. The restaurant had a warm feel about it. Like being in Turkey. They brought us some very tasty Mediterranean bread. It had a  chewy crust and a soft inside, perfect for sopping up the hummus and eggplant appetizers that we had ordered. We also ordered Cigar Rolls / Sigara Boregi. Cigar-shaped pastry stuffed with cheese and parsley that also had a delicious dipping sauce.<br>I didn&#39;t want a heavy meat meal so I opted for two appetizers as my meal. I ordered the Grilled Calamari / Kalamar Izgara. Tender pieces of char-grilled calamari, seasoned with garlic, tarragon and parsley, served with a house salad the tarragon dressing for the calamari was very good as was the salad. I also ordered a falafel appetizer, 5 perfectly cooked falafel balls with some hummus to dip them in. These were the second best falafel balls I&#39;ve ever had. Fried to a crispy golden brown with a moist and delicious inside. I also ordered their Mediterranean beer. My wife ordered the Lamb Shish. Pieces of lamb, marinated in sauce and grilled it was served with rice and house salad. I tried the lamb it was flavorful and tender. My sister in law had the Adana Kebab, chopped lamb with red bell peppers, seasoned and grilled on skewer, served with rice and a house salad. She said it was very good and took some leftovers home. My brother in law had the Iskender Kebab. Doner kebab served over fried pide bread topped with a fresh tomato sauce, yogurt on the side. He liked it, said it had a kick to the sauce. All said and done we enjoyed our first meal at Galata and look forward to going back to try some more of their Mediterranean cooking.",333,0,0,,

There's usually no explanation as to the delay and I end up sitting there amongst the employees who are usually on their phones gossiping to their friends and many  poorly-tattooed delivery guys who never seem to actually be making deliveries. As for deliveries, the two times I've ordered, the food took over 50 minutes to arrive (I live about 3 blocks away) and the burgers were cold, amazingly undersized, and the shakes were essentially soup by that point. I do wonder if they undersize their delivery options to save some cash. I was a big fan of this place when it first opened, but since then, it's gone way down hill.

The food comes out quickly, which is nice. They have a lot of specialty coffees and teas but we didn&#39;t order any since we already got other coffee for when we were waiting in line. I enjoyed the omurice but I&#39;ve had it before at other restaurants and this one wasn&#39;t particularly better. I was a little disappointed in the hot cakes. I&#39;ve had really fluffy Japanese style pancakes before and I&#39;ve loved them but these basically just tasted like a thick cake and not really a pancake in anyway. <br><br>Prices are reasonable and service was nice, but since it&#39;s so small it was literally two people working to serve everyone - one making the food and the other making the coffee/tea and taking orders. We kept having to ask the waitress to refill our waters because she was preoccupied with others and would never notice our glasses were empty (also their water glasses are surprisingly small). Also when my omurice was served, it had fallen over and was spilling out over the plate, just seemed like very rushed presentation of it since they&#39;re so busy. <br><br>I still had a good experience but I don&#39;t think I would come back given the wait time and that I can get omurice at other less tiny restaurants.",329,0,0,,

The broth was not hot enough to slightly cook my bean sprouts and beef. My broth turned pinkish because of the raw beef, but the beef didn't cook a little more, it was basically a disc of pink meat. While some people prefer this, I don't, because pho is not steak carpaccio on top of noodles. Also, the depth of flavor in the soup was short-lived. When the soup first entered my moth, it was mellow beef, great but soon after, there was no substantial taste. Eating the soup along with the noodle almost felt like the soup was whispering ""help!

The oysters were good but not in their shell so the appetizer looked extremely small and underwhelming. They had a savory flavor but not much else. The pork chops were too salty in my opinion.

I've never had Ghananian food, and I'm guessing that most of you probably haven't either.  We were with a mutual friend, who actually studied in Ghana for a semester abroad, who informed me that there's a community in the Bronx and also in DC as far as pockets of people from Ghana go, which is true.  Apart from being in West Africa, the rest that I knew about it came from their amazing World Cup run last year. The best way to sum this up, is that those who are searching for the exotic, should definitely come here.  They don't have a printed menu, but you can simply point to the different things you can choose to eat.  I had a mixture of yellow rice, chicken/beef and cow foot, all food that we also eat in Trinidad, where my parents are from.  However, I don't regularly eat cow's foot, so this was a rather exotic experience for myself as well.  It was definitely interesting and though I can't say I would have it regularly, it's not as bad as you might imagine. To lay it out like this: maybe if you're on a casual, low-key date, and you're with a girl who would be interested and open to trying something exotic, this would be perfect.  Otherwise, there's plenty of McDonalds in the Bronx too, I guess.  While this was the first time in about 8 years that I have been back in the Bronx, I'd say that it was a trip well worth it and I would say that this place made this weekend trip to New York City worthwhile...and it was only Saturday afternoon.",370,0,0,,
1018229,2013-09-15,PqP21Th5vGcj6sdQKbCnmQ,the-burger-guru-brooklyn,1.0,"Short version: I've never given such a low rating to a restaurant in Williamsburg. The owner was rude to our party of 4 on two occasions, and we waited about 15 minutes to be approached by our server. Once we did order, we received our appetizers after 15 minutes, and our beer after 20 minutes. The only part I actually enjoyed was the fact the the patty of the burger was indeed of high quality. Long version: 1) The restaurant is divided into two sections (seems like two neighboring establishments combined into one). The second room is fully open with a view on the street. We saw a couple of tables available, and went to the entrance of the restaurant to try and grab a seat. We were greeted by the owner, who told us it's not possible to get a table in the second room because he has a large party. We decided to leave (because we didn't like the atmosphere in the first room) , and momentarily were chased down by one of the servers telling us he found us a table. As we entered the second room, we realized that the owner was dishonest about the seat availability, as well as the fact that there wasn't a single party, but different groups of people.   2) The second problem was the long wait time I've mentioned in the short version. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to prepare a pitcher of beer.   3) One of the members of our party attempted to find the restroom. It's located in the area between the two rooms, where the kitchen is located; It's a bit confusing. As she was standing there the owner approached her and asked her what she was looking for. She told him she was looking for the restroom, to which he responded ""you shouldn't look for the bathroom, and you should have walked in through the main entrance"". I understand that maybe he thought she came off the street to use the restroom, but if you have a terrible field vision within the vicinity of your own business, maybe you should not automatically assume that your PAYING CUSTOMER who's been sitting in your establishment for close to an hour is someone off the street.",376,0,0,,

We definitely got a bit loud as the night progressed and he put up with us with a smile. The sangria was STRONG. So strong that I can only remember the dessert they brought me for my bday was delicious- I can't remember what it was.

A friend and I went here for dinner-- a year or so ago, I had passed by this place and it smelled delicious, so I finally decided to check it out. Against my heart, I ordered a mixed green salad. It was fairly inexpensive-- $7 or $8? I was not expecting a lot. And the restaurant smelled deliciously of meat and fish, so I was set on being disappointed. But holy wow, was I not disappointed. This salad was not only HUGE, but it had candied pecans that were ridiculously delicious, and amazingly creamy goat cheese. I have actually been craving this salad, that's how good it was. My friend got a salmon burger with some sweet potato fries-- also amazing. Both plates had huge portions and good flavor. My one qualm would be that it's a little dark, even with the TV screens on. It's a little loud too, but that's what's to be expected for the back of a pub. Definitely crowded, though.

While it's not the cheapest sandwich, it's absolutely reasonable for the quality of ingredients you're getting. The texture and pops of little roe eggs really knock the sandwich to another planet. However, the bagel for me was extremely mediocre. Dry, bready, and lacking in crust and chewy texture. I had a piece of herring for $3-4, which was really salty, but delicious like sushi. I would recommend eating it on bread or a cracker with cream sauce, anything to knock the saltiness down. This seems like a take out place though. I would buy bagels separately from place and then pick out your ingredients for sandwich making. I'm sure buying them individually is cheaper and gives you more food for sandwich making.

I am SO happy we ordered from them though! Some of the best food I have gotten off Seamless my whole summer in NYC! First off, the food arrived within the time they estimated & on top of that, the packaging was the best I've seen. It was completely organized in the most efficient way & everything was set up so neat & the food was burning hot & fresh. I hate getting food delivered when everything is spilled, slimy, cold, or shoved in a bag with a drink leaking everywhere. It instantly makes me wanna not eat it. But this food was packaged and organized perfectly. The food itself was amazing. I got the Penne Alla Vodka & my friend got the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes. My other friend got the appetizer sampler which included chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, & potato skins. I tried the pasta obviously & the appetizer sampler & they were both delicious. The pasta was cooked well & there was the perfect amount of really flavorful sauce. The food in the appetizer tray was still crispy & crunchy & everything tasted amazing & I don't even really like chicken wings. I didn't try the salmon but it looked really good.

We went on a Saturday Night with a group of 8 to celebrate my wife's birthday. I had called to inquire about the cover for a Saturday night, and was told at 6pm they didn't charge one. 6pm we show up, and its 5 bucks at the door. Not the biggest deal, but hey, I'm not here to see this cover band, so whatever. We signed up on both the bowling and the dining list. Staring down a 3 hour wait for food, and 4 for bowling, we started off right with a whole bunch of beers. After 3.5 hours, I went to check with the Host to see where my spot in line was. She said they had called me and I didn't answer, so I had been scratched off. The way it works is, you give your cell number, and they call. Guess what? My phone shows no missed calls.  We finally get seated, and let me say, the food is incredible. We got a healthy ( not meaning its good for you) cross section of their offerings. everything was amazing. 4 stars for food, hands down. The server brought the check, and basically told us to take a hike, they needed the table. I didn't mind so much. Clearly there is was wait. Next we wait around for another hour or so for a lane. We finally get one, and bowling commences. The lanes here are great. Perfect amount of slide. Fast resets. It really has everything going for it. 1.5 hours into our 2 hour maximum allowed time, we're told we need to start wrapping it up. WTF? There is still time on the clock. Long story short, Brooklyn Bowl has a lot going for it, but the staff really don't make me thrilled to come back. I will. Maybe next time it'll be better. .",329,0,0,,

Sure, they got our appetizer wrong, brought out my friend's appetizer (which she wanted as a meal) before they brought our shared appetizer (which came out frozen) and made my other friend's tofu look like seared chicken.** But on Yelp, you're defined by the bathroom.*** See through doors, sliding doors and frosted glass are all staples of reviews here. And what did I notice after finishing my business at Spice? No sink. Now, I'm pretty sure that I've missed something at this point. Last I checked, it was pretty necessary for a restaurant to have a sink in their bathroom; apparently the health department frowns on not having one. Sure, it's fine**** if I don't wash my hands ... the only meal I'm infecting is my own*****. But if a cook does that, it's a problem right? So after a few seconds of turning myself right 'round in the six-by-six space, I opened the door and went outside, ostensibly to figure out where they had misplaced their sink. Apparently they keep it outside the bathroom, where both men, women, children and cooks can all use the same one sink. A line of people washing their hands all up in the middle of everyone eating dinner? That doesn't seem like a good idea. My pad thai was fine, but two pieces of shrimp in the whole deal?

Grilled chicken is their specialty, but I opted for a half rack of barbecue ribs with beans and rice and mac and cheese for the sides. The ribs were just ok. There was plenty of meat on them, but there was also gristle and it was a little dry. The barbecue sauce helped moisten things up a bit.  Fred Flintstone would have been proud, but it was nothing to write home about. The sides were a horror - communion wafers would have had more flavor than this slop.  How can beans and rice or Mac and cheese be devoid of any flavor?  I don't know, you have to ask the cook. The sides are laid out cafeteria style in warming trays and it looked like they were cooking for days on end, turning into steaming, flavorless globs of their former selves.  Of course, none of it looked appetizing behind the greasy counter glass and the worn out tray covers. Also unsettling is the number of religious imagery in the store.  There was a huge, really tawdry shrine right on top of the soda fridge and a large crucifix looming over the dining tables.  There was also a really cheesy last supper scene laid out in metal relief.

This bouncer was clearly such a loser on a power trip because he has nothing else going for him. Me and my friend were inside the lounge behind this loser when another friend that went outside was not allowed back in. And after a few minutes of talking to our friend, the bouncer threw us out for no good reason very impolitely I must add, even though we were still in the club and never exited. He was so rude screaming in our faces even though we did not do anything wrong. They were throwing a lot of people out for no reason just so they could charge you a fee to re enter, ranging from $20-40 depending on what that bouncer wanted to charge you. And he will only stamp you if he felt like it even if you asked him to stamp you before you went out, it was more likely that he will throw you out and charge you to re-enter. This place is not worth going to especially when you have to deal with terrible staff. The bouncers even gave their own workers issues getting in, someone from inside had to come out to get the worker. All in all this place is LAME. I would never return by choice.",272,0,0,,

Customer service is pretty good and the staff are pretty nice. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried their hummus bowls before which can get pretty expensive when you start to add in additional toppings.

I liked everything in this dish except I was a little bit disappointed by the baked falafels. I was expecting a more crunchier texture, but it felt like it was falling apart and not as delicious as the ones I&#39;ve had at Hummus &amp; Pita Co., but their falafels are deep fried.  <br><br>The second time I tried their mushroom hummus bowl with lemon/parsley,  avocado and basmati/tumeric rice which was even more fantastic.

But they also have all kinds of sandwhiches, wraps, pizza, salads etc. I haven't tried that much but I assume it's all good! For breakfast, I like the Puebla, which is eggs scrambled with sausage, potato and some peppers with tortilla chips. Ask for the salsa so it's not too dry, it's a nice starchy, hearty breakfast. The tortas are unique and great as well, the ""La Flor"" is a bbq pork sandwhich that I'd recommend. Deserts are recommended as well, chocolate bread heated up in the oven is amazing.

Once we arrived, there was only 8 of us so they would not seat us until the other 2 arrived. Turns out it wouldn't have mattered anyway as the tables which were ours were still taken, even 45 minutes after 8. By the time we were about to sit, they tell us that there is only 1lb of meat left. Recall that we had a reservation, which is actually more of a meat reservation than a seat reservation, and they still ran out. We were pissed and stormed out, walking down the street to Fette Sau instead. What was the point of a reservation if we couldn't order any brisket, and we couldn't get a table at our reservation time? If you are a reader who pays attention, you should be questioning why I gave this place a 5-star review, despite all that happened. Well, my buddy who made the reservation sent an email to the owner telling him what happened, telling him that it was a big time fail and an epic embarrassment for him and my birthday party plans. The owner responded with an actual paper card with a handwritten apology, and a gift card on it. Epic customer service + apology + acknowledgment that you were in the wrong = excellent review and repeat customers. After that service, the meat would have to be pretty bad to get a negative rating from me, but luckily for us, BrisketTown meat is amaze-balls. I have been here once before and must say that the quality of brisket is like no other I have found in the city. The exterior rub is out of this world, and the meat so flavorful and tender.

I was wrong though. The light battered Calamari was served with long hot peppers that tasted just like Shishito peppers. The baked clams was a total miss. The Linguine with clams was off, not sure what it was, maybe the spring onion? I typically do not get spring onion on my linguine with clam. The fusilli was bland, I couldn't bare to eat more than a couple of pieces. There was nothing really interesting to say about it. The Chicken Parm sandwich was quite difficult to tackle. i don't like bread, but i had hopes that maybe this sandwich would be the best choice but nope.

Add pork belly as a topping for 4 bucks- brings the bowl to almost $20.00.  The pork belly was a total let down- WAY too much fat on it, not the melt-in-your-mouth type or delicious flavor at all.  Should have skipped this topping for sure.

998117,2013-08-23,OZexlK3A3IN-6LGz3ywQjw,tabata-ramen-new-york-3,4.0,"I will admit that I'm a fan and customer of the original Tabata at 9th Avenue and when I saw online that Tabata 2 was opening up on 8th Avenue and located even closer to the front entrance of the Port Authority, I couldn't help but to try the place. Tabata just opened a week ago and is located on 8th Avenue between 37th and 38th Streets.   I generally consider the Port Authority area to be a wasteland for good food and having a quality ramen joint close to a major commuter area is wonderfully convenient.  For those who know the original Tabata on Ninth Avenue, here are a few differences: *The dining room is long and narrow, but doesn't seem as wide as the original. There seems to be fewer 4 seat tables, as most of the restaurant is of the one and two seat variety. * The dining room is better lit and uses warm earth toned floors and tiled walls. * In the original Tabata, there are many color signs that show restaurant specialties, such as green noodles, fried chicken wings, and pork sausage, but at the new location, there are only a few such signs. * There are fewer waiters, but there are fewer seats at this location. * The menu is smaller. The original has about 13 types of ramen, but the new one, if my memory is correct has only 8 or 9 choices. In my opinion, these choices are varied enough so that it's not a setback. There is also a decent selection of appetizers, although the choices are fewer than the original. I had the Sutamina Ramen, which is what I consider ""a flavor of all trades"" type of ramen. It's miso, spicy, garlicky and soy all mixed into one broth without one element getting into the way of another. I ordered extra noodles for a few dollars more. The noodles are nicely eggy and chewy, just the way I like ramen.  The porl was sliced thinly and wasn't cha siu style as with many ramen joints. It was thin, tender and moist. I also had the chicken karage (fried chicken) and the fried squid. Both were excellent. I especially liked the dollop of ponzu on minced daikon for the chicken. Both were served on a small bed of salad. Most appetizers were in the $5 to $8 range and most ramen were in the $9 to $10 range. For that price, in a highly trafficked area, you will rarely get a better deal. Finally, the service was excellent and welcoming.

The linguine was dry, bottom line all the food served to us was not fresh at all it was a disaster I will never eat here again. The waitress was nice enough to remove the entree from our bill but still charged us for 2 lobster tails and the bill came out to 71 dollars and some change even with the entree removed and we didn't even order alcoholic beverages.

DRINKS -specialty craft cocktails of the night: lipstick fizz (play on the name of the building), old fashioned, prosecco and berries, and a smokey margarita.  All nicely presented and well-blended, the gin-based lipstick fizz was my favorite.

The chicken was done well, not at all dry but moist and crunchy on the outside.  Waffle burger, regular burger, and biscuits with gravy were just as delicious - everybody was so satisfied with their food, they were practically licking their plates clean.  Definitely recommend this place for a nice, quality, laid-back brunch with a nice portion of mimosas :)",179,0,0,,

A mimosa would run u $20 and the food is finished in a bite. 3 of us had to leave a bit earlier than the rest and paid for our food separately. We put $180 towards the bill plus tip, said our goodbyes and left. Later on in the evening the birthday girl informed me that the waitress said we only put $50 towards the bill when we left. My friend politely explained to her she was wrong and they called security on my friends. It was very embarrassing and unnecessary. In the end, she ended up coming out of pocket an extra $130. I still had my receipt to prove that she was misinformed. She called management, explained the situation, gave them my card information and told them she had the receipt and here we are 2 weeks later with nothing done.

2465099,2016-12-07,P5jw8VdVSFb1oWY9UyqcWA,otto-enoteca-pizzeria-new-york,4.0,"Otto Enoteca is primarily a more fancy pizza and wine place than a pasta place. Nonetheless, since I personally prefer homemade pasta over pizza, I of course skipped over their extensive pizza menu and went straight for the pastas. They have some classic comfort foods like Spaghetti Carbonara and Fusilli with sausage and escarole.<br><br>I first started with the Caprese salad. I can&#39;t say enough how much I&#39;m addicted to cheese, and wherever they serve fresh mozzarella I&#39;ve got to order it. Their version here on the small side, just really a small ball of fresh mozzarella drizzled in a pesto sauce with lots of diced tomatoes on the side. It was really more of a tomato dish than anything else LOL. Still, all of it was fresh, the tomatoes were very juicy and nicely seasoned with salt.<br><br>I decided to go with the meat Ravioli. Again, the portions at Otto are small, it was just a handful of ravioli pieces on my plate. However, it was very generously bathe in this sweet tomato sauce, and when I asked my waiter to add cheese he came back quickly and shaved off a big block of Parmigiana, which really added so much more good flavor to the ravioli. Definitely a great dish, only wish they gave a bit more LOL.<br><br>Otto&#39;s offers a wide selection of desserts and gelato. I must recommend that you not skip out of tasting the gelatos here. I chose 2 scoops of Olive Oil gelato, and one scoop blood orange sorbet. OMFG the olive oil was soooo amazing, you could really taste the virgin olive oil infused into the cream. It was also seasoned with a little bit of salt, so don&#39;t be alarmed by that because if anything it really just added to the flavor like licking the salt off a glass of margarita. The orange sorbet was tart and refreshing.",313,0,0,,

What made this dinner special was the Uni and Wagyu hand roll ($16 on it&#39;s own, and extra charge if added into the Domokase). This literally melt in my mouth and was absolutely delightful.<br><br>We got the Domokase (signature course) for $85:<br>1. Oyster Sampler - seasonal oyster with scallop, yuzu foam. This yuzu foam was super citrusy and refreshing - goes great with the oysters.<br><br>2. Chawanmushi - egg custard, black truffle sauce with cremini mushroom. I really liked the addition of black truffle sauce, and the consistency &amp; creaminess of the Chawanmushi was spot on.<br><br>3. Salmon tartare - with sourdough and yuzu yogurt. I didn&#39;t find this particularly memorable. I mean it was good but nothing amazing. <br><br>4. Miso black cod - with Kabocha puree with picked mustard seeds. Loved the umami kick and strong miso flavor from the cod. Yum! <br><br>5. Tuna cone - with truffle oil and granola. I thought the idea of putting tuna in an ice cream cone was an interesting idea, I think I would not have liked it if the cone was bigger but it was a nice bite sized. <br><br>6. Scallop - with sweet onion sauce and dashi risotto. The dashi risotto was delicious; creamy and savory. Scallop was seared really nicely too. <br><br>7. Chef&#39;s choice premium sushi (8 pieces) - this was delicious. Everything that the chef gave me and my husband were extremely fresh.<br><br>8. Choice of (1) hand roll - I paid extra (I believe it was $8 extra?) and got the Uni &amp; Wagyu (A5, Miyazaki) hand roll. OH MY GOD. This made my night. This was like surf and turf in one bite. The sweetness and brininess from the uni with the rich flavorful wagyu. I was in heaven. Literally melts in your mouth! <br><br>9. Dessert - I got the Matcha ice cream with chocolate sauce. It was just your standard Matcha ice cream, nothing special. My husband got the Hojicha pudding, he said he really liked the roasted nutty taste of the Hojicha tea in the pudding. <br><br>For drinks, we asked for recommendation in terms of Sake, our waitress recommended the SOTO (Niigata) for $50. It was really crisp, refreshing with a dry finish. However, we did not feel that this was $50 worth of Sake. We googled afterwards and retail price is $19.99 so I felt a little jipped. <br><br>Overall, great service and delicious food. However, I don&#39;t think I will be doing the Domokase again. I might end up doing the Sushi &amp; Handroll course ($45) that has Choice of Salmon/Tuna sashimi, chef&#39;s choice sushi (8 pieces) and choice of (2) hand rolls. Obviously, pay extra to substitute the hand rolls for the uni &amp; wagyu hand rolls. <br><br>Tip: My husband said if you want to sit at the sushi bar, you do need to specify it in the reservation.",484,0,0,,

Even if you&#39;re visiting, there are much better places to go. <br><br>We made a reservation for a Sunday night. We were seated as soon as we arrived. We ordered two glasses of Sancerre Rosé, which was excellent--but it ended up being the only excellent part of our visit. <br><br>Service was slow but friendly and attentive enough. The staff is huge, the restaurant bustling. <br><br>The food, though, left a lot to be desired. The French Onion soup arrived a bit warmer than lukewarm. It was filled with good, rich cheese, onions, and bread, but the cheese was fully submerged in the bowl when the soup arrived, not crusted over the top as it should be (at least at a top tier French restaurant charging $16 for soup). The bread was totally squishy, without any crunch. It had obviously been swimming in the soup for a while. <br><br>We had the lobster linguine and Niçoise salad for dinner. The large pasta ($34) wasn&#39;t very large, and while it was fresh enough, it wasn&#39;t anything remarkable. Most folks could make it at home for 1/4 the cost. The Niçoise was fine, but nothing more. Fresh enough, with a lot of good vegetables in it. But at $26, it was not anywhere near worth the cost, in terms of taste, presentation, or anything else. It was especially underwhelming given that we waited over 35 minutes after the appetizer was taken away for the main course. We ate quickly, unimpressed. <br><br>By the time the waiter tried to offer us dessert (another 10 minutes after we finished eating), we were so ready to go that we waved off the menus and asked for the check.

Called at 3 PM on 2/28, and after about 10 attempts, got through, resy for 2 at 7:30. Perfect. Arrived there at 7:20, was told to sit in the fringes, as the table wasn't ready yet, and would we like a beer? This is not your high-end restaurant that gives you a free drink if you have to wait for your reservation. This is a ""have a $15 dollar imported beer because that's all we have"" kind of situation. While the beer is great, it's not a good look when only 2 of the 15 or so beers are below $10, especially if you have to drink them while you wait for your table, where about 2-3 tables are empty at any given time (I get that they have low staff, but again, not a good look for a small ramen joint). 50 minutes and two beers each pass (that's 4 beers - $60 before we're even seated) before we get our table, at 8:20. They are already out of one appetizer (the chicken wings), and have only one of the specials left (clams). The U&I, an AMAZING app, is $24, and the okonomiyaki (nothing like the traditional kind, and assisted immensely by a maple-esque syrup) app is $18. The Tonkatsu 2.0 and Spicy Miso are on point, just as good as when they were in pop-up mode, and easily on par with the best in the city (the wavy noodles in the Miso are especially good, and the seasoned eggs are PERFECTLY done). So, it's a great ramen place with fantastic appetizers. But...a ramen place that takes resys and costs about $100 per person for 4 beers, one app, and one ramen shouldn't be organized so poorly, with empty tables leering while you wait well past your reservation time while you sip your extravagantly priced beer as to not have to order another before you even get to sit down. Until they fix either the pricing or the service, I couldn't recommend going there again. OH, and is this place good for kids? YES. How do I know this?

The Porchetta is simple: slightly spiced chunks of pork stuffed into a delectable, fresh, crunchy bread unaccompanied by any unwelcome vegetables or spreads. It's also well-designed, as it isn't as messy as you might expect. (Approved for sidewalk eating.) Personally, I find white meat bland, so I wasn't as impressed as the rest of New York.

I started off with the cheese pierogis because I had the lowest expectation for it, since there was no meat! Unfortunately, it was nothing special. Could possibly be improved if cooked it hot enough for the cheese inside to melt. Next, the meat pierogis. When doused in gravy, this taste like meaty heaven. Makes me wish I could have swapped out my cheese pierogis. Last came the stuffed cabbage. The amount of meat you get is equivalent to the size of a tiny man's fist wrapped in cabbage.

Being that we we seeing a show, we all ordered off the pre-theatre menu, which is a great deal for $39. It's pretty much equivalent to a Restaurant Week meal. You're given three or four choices per course and for our appetizers, we ended up ordering the Ceasar Salad and Clam Chowder. For our entrees, we had one filet, one Kona Crusted Dry-Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter and one Double Cut set of three Lamb Rip Chops. Appetizers were very yummy all around. The clam chowder was hearty, but not overly thick and had a good amount of clams. The Ceasar Salad with fresh and well dressed. Moving on to the mains, I ordered my lamb chops medium rare and they arrived perfectly cooked, very juicy and very tasty. They did come resting on oil and vinegar, which I just brushed off. As for the filet, just note that on their online menu, it lists a 10 oz filet, but once you're in the restaurant, the menu lists an 8 oz filet. Anyways, the filet, also ordered medium rare, came perfectly cooked, but was otherwise underseasoned and somewhat bland. The same goes for the sirloin - perfectly cooked at medium rare, but maybe it was the Kona crusting? Something was off - it lacked the good and sizzling charred taste of a sirloin. In terms of the sides - mashed potates and creamed spinach, we had two orders of potatoes and one of spinach. Both were excellent. You could really taste the butter and the milk in the potatoes too. We all opted for the sorbet for dessert and chose mango and lemon as our flavors. For whatever reason, we were all served two scoops of mango and one of lemon. Both were yummy, but it would've been nice to have more lemon. Service was overall very friendly and professional, but after we arrived back home, there was a major gaffe. In addition to taking our leftover meat home, we'd also asked for the remained of the potatoes and spinach (there was a lot of each), as well as the remainder of the bread, since there was a lot and it'd otherwise just get thrown away.

The mimosas were refreshing and delicious and my friends and I could have sworn they got stronger throughout our brunch.

Overall, the service was outstanding, the food delicious and the drinks were a flowin' without any feeling of being rushed or being told your bottomless drinks were finished.  I told my boyfriend that we should come here but honestly, I don't mind who I come with because what I do know is that I definitely want to come back here again!",379,0,0,,

This curiosity led me to 'The Thirsty Koala' in Astoria for dinner. I happened to walk in during happy hour, which is from 4-8PM during the week. Glasses of wine are $4, select draft beers (about 3) are $3, and cocktails are 2 for 1 at $8 per round. Our waiter also informed us of a special menu during happy hour, which included pulled pork tacos and kangaroo steak. My drink of choice for the evening was the caipirinha, which was PERFECT. I initially ordered a margarita and wasn't all too impressed as I only tasted the tequila. After looking over the menu several times I finally had my order ready. I ordered a burger with kangaroo meat, which you MUST order medium rare and comes with goat cheese. Besides that the burger comes with caramelized onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and sliced red onions and a side of chips (fries). The sides included with the meal are a sweet chili sauce (not fiery at all) and ketchup, but I also ordered a side of the chipotle aioli for my burger. There are plenty of other options like chicken, steak, etc. and you don't necessarily need to order kangaroo meat. However, I was feeling quite adventurous and wanted to try it out since so many Yelpers recommended it. My thoughts? Personally, I think I'll stick to beef because the taste was a tad bit different than what I thought it would be. But I would go back and try kangaroo steak just to give it one last shot.

My bf and I went here for our anniversary (after a pleasant experience we had over the summer) and we were in and out in about 45 mins. I don't know about you, but when I go out for a special occasion (like my 11th anniversary with my sweetheart) I expect a nice slow dinner. Instead what we got was one insult after another. The table that they seated us at was next to their waiter station, if my chair was run into 10 times that wouldn't have been a big deal...but every 5 seconds? I don't think so. Next, we received our menus. I barely had time to read the menu and they were hounding us for our order. We had them come back. We place the order...apps came out before our cocktails!?!? Really? Then, we barely finished our guac, and here come the entrees. Rushed much? Meanwhile, there are tons of groups in the place, but no couples...it was as if they couldn't stand to serve anyone under the age of 85 or without a cadre of brats accompanying them. I've never in my life experienced a restaurant that preferred families and geriatric groups to couples. For example, one group of 65+ were there before us...they had placed their order before we even sat down...who do you think got their entrees first? That's right, us...in fact we got our entrees so far before them that we were finished with our entrees before they even got theirs!!!!   I couldn't take the chair bumping any longer, so the bf asked if we could move. They begrudgingly moved us to a different table outside of the traffic pattern. We were about mid entree at this point. After we finished our entrees, the bf went to the bathroom...and to my surprise, the dessert menu was brought to me...the waiter basically commanded that the chocolate cake was the best thing on the menu. I waited for my bf to come back to the table and then I got up to go to the ladies room. While I am in the ladies room the waiter comes to take our desert order!!!! Mind you, we've only been in the restaurant about 45 mins at this point (and there ate plenty of open tables). We opt out of dessert not wanting to spend anymore of our time or money in this insulting place. Somehow, the host/manager gets that we are pissed and comes to talk to us...I explain what has transpired, and how displeased we are with the rushed service. He offers to comp our entire meal..,the most insulting offer I've ever received at a restaurant. How dare they imply that we were only making a stink to get them to comp our meal.

The food was alright, but you could definitely find better ones in Chinatown or new world market in flushing for a cheaper price. Service was unacceptable. First, we were seated in a two people small table and after we ordered they told us to move to a larger table because our food could not fit on the small table.  We moved to the larger table and the server just looked at us and told us to go back and get our plates, cups and everything else instead of helping us. Through the midway of our dinner, the server started to take some plates away and he stopped when we told him that we are not completely done.  So we just continued to eat thinking that he probably won't be back for a while, but after only five minutes, he puts the check on the table. RUDE! I thought to myself, but I paid right away thinking that maybe then they would leave us alone and let us finish our food.  They came back really quick with my cc. The total was 80 dollars for two people because we ordered extra food for togo, so I signed a $10 tip even though they deserve none.  I put the signed cc on the side and continue to eat my food but the server just couldn't wait to see the tip and took the signed cc away while i was still eating. AHHHHH!!! I thought this time they wud finally be done, but NO! The server came back and told me I HAVE to give at least 15% tip. By that time I just wanted to get out asap and never come back. So I added two more dollars to the tip and asked the server if that was enough and he said yes and walked away. I understand the 15% tip base but what I don't understand is how do they expect anyone to give them any tip with such rude service.  If they wanted that extra two bucks then they should have just added it to the bill and I would have no problem, but coming up and asking the customer to give more tip is pretty sad. I feel bad writing this review because i saw one of the server running all over the place and doing all the work while some of them just stood there and watch how much tip people give.

I've passed by this place many times and made a couple of bad judgments based on their sign and name, ""Han Dynasty."" Just seemed like another American Chinese restaurant where they serve you chicken and broccoli. Decided to give this spot a try based on Yelp reviews. We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup, scallion pancake, eggplant in garlic sauce, the dry pepper fish, and the Taiwanese sausage fried rice. The beef noodle soup was really good, perfect combo of flavor and spice. It just looks a lot more intimidating than it tastes. I can't really tolerate spice, but this one was okay for me. The spice doesn't linger and so it was perfect. Might be our favorite new place to get spicy beef noodle soup. The beef was also very tender which is always a plus. Scallion pancake as pretty good, was thin and not overloaded with flour. I hate the ones where they stuff you up with flour. I usually like thin ones with lots of scallions. The sauce they gave you with the scallion pancakes was also different from other restaurants. They usually give you sweetened soy sauce and sometimes vinegar but this was a special sauce they made. I'm not sure what they put in it. The eggplant was just okay. I've had better and this one was nothing special, but still good. The dry pepper fish was SO good and flavorful! It is not as spicy as it looks since it is fried fish and it doesn't absorb all the chili. Next time I will try the dry pepper chicken. This dish was yummy. Last was the Taiwanese sausage fried rice. This was really good. I know it's just fried rice, but with the Taiwanese sausage, it really made a difference and I wanted to devour the whole dish. It's because it was just fried rice and still so damn good, which made it very impressive to me. I def have to come back here and try other dishes like the ma po tofu, and dan dan noodles. I think for its location, price and flavors, this might be one of my fav Sichuan style foods! Very glad I tried this place today!",382,1,0,,

The table settings and menu prices seem to say ""fine dining"" while the portion sizes and plating of the dishes themselves scream university meal hall. It made me feel deeply uncomfortable. When we checked the Yelp details, under ""attire"" it said ""Casual,"" so we strolled into the restaurant in shorts/tank/t-shirt and flip-flops. After walking inside, however, I felt like *maybe* we should have been dressed a little nicer - not much, but a little. We walked in, regardless, past the somewhat-fancy looking bar to the hostess, and were seated quickly (time check was around 5:15 p.m. on a Saturday). Anytime I sit at a restaurant with full plate settings and cloth napkins and tablecloths I always feel like I should have upped my attire. But then the waitress came. She was wearing a t-shirt, too, so I didn't feel so bad after all. But then I looked at the wine list. Extensive. And the menu prices? Entrees are upwards of $17. Maybe I should have worn a dress? But then we ordered. The food came out in the same kind of dishware and with the same attention to plating as my alma mater's mess hall. And now that they really had my attention, the cutlery on the table didn't even match! Then, our entrees came out. Now, this is definitely not a complaint, especially considering the prices, but the serving sizes were monstrous. My husband and I both looked at one another. I'm pretty sure if we had finished our plates, we both would have needed a gurney to get out of the restaurant. I ordered the veggie meatloaf, which likely weighed in around six pounds. It was delicious and was served with a nice tomato sauce, however it also was served with about two cups of rice. I would definitely recommend having the option to include a side of steamed vegetables or something, even though it came with a salad as a starter (albeit *romaine* lettuce based - snorefest!). I made it about half-way through the loaf before waving my white flag and boxing it up. I barely touched the rice. It didn't even seem to be seasoned. My husband got the wheat-less, dairy-less veggie lasagna, which was also delicious, but I'll leave those details for his review. Needless to say, this place seems to be caught in some sort of restaurant limbo, somewhere between being a cafeteria and fine dining. While the portion sizes were big and the main meals tasted great, I probably won't find myself sauntering back here for a while.",436,1,0,,

The sausage and peppers was also really tasty but I wouldn't recommend one serving of it for a large group because there just wasn't enough. Entree-wise I ordered the ribs which came with cheese grits, not my favorite addition to my heavenly pork meal, but with all the appetizers I was easily satisfied by the dish.

It's a great deal if you're a quick drinker. To my pleasant surprise, they were serving Lion's Head instead of the urine-water known as Coors Light, which is apparently what's typically included in the deal. The wings were decent - I think they were baked instead of fried, so slightly healthier (which is important when you're spending 2 hours devouring wings and beer). The other food looked pretty good too. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive despite having way too many tables to cover, both inside and outside. My only complaint about Mel's is that it wasn't exactly a bar crowd and thus not a very exciting place to watch a game. We only saw one other guy do the beer & wings but he was with his wife and kid. 90% of the customers were families with kids. Fortunately most of the kids were well-behaved and most of the families were at least somewhat interested in the game - some even had jerseys on - so it wasn't that bad. So if you want a more ""chill"" football-watching experience and a good bargain, Mel's is a good bet. If you want to get rowdy you're better off going elsewhere.

My fiancee loves Thai food though, so I suggested we check this out since it's down the block from our apt, and I'm glad I did! FOOD: we split several app's to start (vegetable dumplings, curry puffs), and each ordered our own entree. The dumplings were fantastic, and unlike most appetizers, there were more than enough for us to actually share them. Same story with the curry puffs. I ordered the pork chops, and she got a more traditional Thai dish that I can't remember the name of but it was both delicious and spicy. My pork shops were cooked pretty well despite being pretty thin. Simply put, we ate and ate, and boy did we love every moment of it. DRINKS: they have a pretty typical line of cocktails, wines, and beer. We both opted for a beer with our dinner, and Enthaice featured brews from both local vendors as well as some more well-known regional and national breweries. PRICES: we ate an obscene amount of food, and both had one beer each, yet the total was far less than I thought it would be. So not only is the food excellent, it's seriously affordable making this a prime location to pick up a take out order from on the way home. SERVICE: they are extremely friendly and efficient. There are a number of servers and busboys on the floor at any given time (which makes it kinda difficult to get by them on the way to the restroom, but NBD on that one). Whatever works so long as the service is as friendly and fast as I experienced on a Friday night.

An old brownstone turned into a restaurant, it has a lot of charm, coziness and character.  We walked in and we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who took our jackets and took us to our seats.  We were seated in my least favorite type of tables, the tables for two that are an inch apart from each other but luckily, there was no one to each side of us so I was ok.   The ambiance is fantastic, charming and well decorated with wonderful paintings, mirrors, crown moldings and the best part, very comfortable seats.  The place also has a second floor that is supposed to be even nicer than the first floor and can be rented for private pirates.   The service was fantastic, with our very friendly and handsome server assisting us all along the way.  We order two glasses of a red wine...  I don't know if it was the size of the glass or the portion, but it looked kind of anemic.  Meanwhile, we order the Warm Asparagus with enoki mushrooms, avocado and salad ($12).  The appetizer was split for us and both portions were big, with the asparagus being perfectly steamed.  All the components of the appetizer matched perfectly... next time I won't share it! For the main course I ordered the Duck ($27) and my friend the Lobster ($38).  The presentation of all dishes were executed perfectly.  I am kind of weary of duck as it can be easily overcooked but mine was just perfect.  I ate the entire dish and left me completely satisfied.  The lobster was also perfectly executed and nothing was left on either plate.  The server stopped by once in a while to charm us with his smile and check that everything was up to our satisfaction. For dessert we ordered and shared the cheesecake ($9) which was very soft, creamy and the taste was very different from any other cheesecake - not as heavy yet full of flavor and satisfying.

I know it's the Upper East Side, but it was $10 more for all you can eat sushi than a comparable place and quality in Chicago, so I thought it was a bit much. Fortunately for Chinatown East I was really craving sushi, and a lot of it. I was impressed with the diverse maki and specialty roll selection, not to mention the individual sushi pieces. Each roll we had was very good. My favorite is the tried and true Dragon roll. Now the cons. Well, con really. The service. First it was friendly, but strange. For some reason we had two waitresses, which I guess didn't matter a whole lot for us (except that we had to keep repeating that the other waitress had already taken our order), but I imagine it was challenging for them. Next, when we got the bill, being young adults each on somewhat modest budgets, no one was about to take the whole thing so, since we all had the all you can eat special, we requested the check be split evenly 4 ways. Simple, right? Wrong. We got the checks back: $30, $31, $35 and $35. We asked the waitress why they weren't equal and she said ""They add up to the total amount"". Well, yes, but that's not what we asked. She said ""Oh, that happens sometimes"". We asked if she could fix it and she unapologetically giggled and said ""No"".  Sure, it was a difference of a couple of bucks so not a huge deal, but the fact that she was so unsorry and nonchalant and borderline rude was very frustrating. We didn't want to fight it, though, because we were afraid they would double charge us. So overall, good food, bad service.",316,0,0,,

I doubt you&#39;d be able to see everything in one day anyways so plan accordingly if you do want to see the whole museum. There are over 2 000 000 pieces to see!!<br><br>Adam and I got there around 5pm and even though there are lots of people when you get in, the museum is so big you can easily avoid crowds by starting in further sections of the museum. Every room is numbered and with the map it is extremely easy to navigate. I made sure to cross off every room seen on our map so we would see everything.<br><br>The exhibition of the moment was David Hockney and I was quite excited because some of his works are featured in Bojack Horseman (with horses, not humans though). That room was extremely busy though so keep in mind that special exhibits will be crowded.<br><br>We ended our visit with a little break on the Met Steps (Gossip Girl shout out!). Our feet were completely dead by the time we finished our visit at 9pm (then again it&#39;s also because we visited museums all day).<br><br>I can&#39;t tell you what a great attraction this is and how worth it is to visit. With the City Pass it is included, but otherwise it is pay what you want entry. But if you are hesitating at paying full price, don&#39;t worry, it is well worth the money!",294,0,0,,

If you're smart, find someone to order the food for you. Pros: - Really Cheap Food - Compared to restaurants similar to it, there is a lot of seating here - Large drink selection - You get to see those huge sesame pancakes being made in person Cons: - If it's your first time, ordering isn't going to be pleasant. You walk all the way to the end of the store, find the grouchy lady that takes your order and then get pushed by other patrons because like the people that work here, everyones grouchy because it's hot, tight, and sticky everywhere. - It's seriously dirty. I kind of lost my appetite because everything was sticky and greasy. - Really bad service. Even for a Chinese joint. You'll get your money snatched, scowls, ignored, and even yelled at. I understand the style of the business is turning over customers as quick as possible to compensate for the low prices but their rudeness was just unnecessary. But honestly, the service is so bad, my friend and I couldn't help but laugh it off at the end.   - The dumplings were surprisingly just ... okay. I was expecting them to be really good because of all the hype and the huge line but they were good at best. Nothing special and nothing worth walking 30 minutes for. Seriously, don't walk 30 minutes to go here, even if you're only spending $6 on dinner. - Bad dumpling sauce. It just soy and vinegar and the sriracha looked so gross. - And seriously, why does Chinatown smell so ... bad? Especially on this street. Not trying to be rude but the stench is almost unbearable especially when its warmer. Conclusion: Lots of cons. Was it worth going? I think so but only if you have an open mind. If you're in the area and you want to do something ridiculous, I say why not? It's so bad, it was almost fun laughing everything off and escaping the smells of Chinatown.

My father asked for his steak rare. It came out medium-well.... which is a very big difference. But, we understand these things happen so he simply called over the waiter and explained to him. The waiter was polite and said that he would bring this to his manager. The manager, who knows that we come frequently, began to argue with my father stating that the steak was fine. As a business owner, the customer is always right (especially when a steak is barely pink and the customer asked for it rare). It was just very tacky and uncomfortable.

This is definitely a sushi buffet, and not a buffet that also has some questionable looking sushi. There are tons of different rolls and they are all pretty good. Both times I came for lunch and the $18 or so price tag is well worth it. As my friend who I was with remarked, if a buffet is less than this, the sushi is probably questionable and sketchy. Here though, everything is fresh as well as tasty. Is it the best quality sushi ever? Of course not, but it was definitely better than what I expected. I really liked this spicy tuna with peanut sauce as it was different and actually went together well. All of the rolls with eel were also excellent. They are creative (do not go by the online menu as they have lots of other stuff) and make really delicious rolls. Apparently they also do rolled to order hand rolls but I didn't try that. The nigiri was also good. In terms of the hot food, there aren't so many options that it is overwhelming. The hot stuff was good, not mind blowing. I liked all of the fish entrees and especially enjoyed the vegetables. All of the vegetable dishes I had were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. One thing I would not recommend: the calamari. The breading is kind of weird and there is a lot of other stuff that tastes better. There are also a ton of different salads. Definitely enjoyed that and was not expecting it. The crab soup was also excellent and I really enjoyed it (tons of crab flavor as it had like huge crab legs in it). The desserts are great also. They have a bunch of different kinds of cake and they are cut into small squares so you can try multiple things without getting too full. Definitely save room for this. Among other things, they had mocha walnut cake (really good), green tea cake (good but wish it had more green tea flavor), blueberry cheesecake (enjoyable), chocolate (average), plus others. The green tea ice cream is excellent and they have little plastic cups and spoons so you can take it to go. Probably some of the best green tea ice cream I've tried. The dinner prices are significantly higher (around $30 I think), and also include made to order crepes and potentially other stuff. That's still a decent price, but I think the lunch is an especially good deal. I will definitely be back. Alcohol and other drinks are available for purchase also.",439,0,0,,

The Yelp reviews were promising as well. There was no wait. We were seated immediately and served ice water. By the look of the contents in the menu, this restaurant appears to have a bit of an identity crisis. They serve anything from Shanghainese soup dumplings (obviously from the restaurant name), to dim sum, to Szechuan cuisine. Not that there is necessarily wrong with having everything in one place, but it is still nonetheless very strange and out of the norm. We ordered one of the regular soup dumplings, one of the crab meat soup dumplings, and dan dan noodles to share between the two of us. One order of xiao long baos only come with 6 soup dumplings (sad face!). The skin of the dumplings is very delicate and soft; the dumplings itself taste very fresh and light. Unfortunately the soup dumplings here fall short compared to those from Joe's Shanghai in terms of taste. The vinegar sauce that is served here is too sweet for my taste, but not too bad once paired with the soup dumplings. The dan dan noodles were definitely pretty yummy here and you can really taste the peanut butter sauce - Sure, I'd recommend this. In terms of service they are pretty good although we were given our check as soon as we finished our last bite.

I always have a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounds good. <br>I usually am the one to go for chocolate, custard or nuts in terms of pies, but their fruit pies are also super delicious. I love their apple one and their vegan/gluten free blueberry one is also delicious. Their black currant one is nice if you like something tart. I&#39;ve also tried a lemon and a key lime which which is also delicious if you like something with a tang. They recently also had a meyer lemon sunshine pie which was not as tangy, but it is creamier because I think they added cream cheese to it. With that one, it does give a bit of a aftertaste with the cream cheese which I don&#39;t love, but I really like the overall flavor of the pie. <br>I love the chocolate pies, but being a chocolate lover, I can&#39;t say anything bad about them. They also also not overly sweet so I can definitely have a whole slice to myself. I also tried the brown butter honey pecan, which is a bit heavier than the other pies, but I love the crunch that it has along with the butter flavor and the depth that honey adds compared to sugar. <br>I haven&#39;t tried all their pies, but they have seasonal ones too which makes it a little less boring. They also make maple whipped cream which you can top it for $1. They also make pie shakes where they can blend a whole slice of pie with ice cream. <br>The store itself is quite small.

1602536,2015-03-01,a_MEeXnPNLAKTuqusYLzFw,kao-soy-brooklyn,4.0,"We first tried Kao Soy (dining in) a few weeks after it opened and when there were nothing but 5 star Yelp reviews.  The meal was good, but certainly not 5 stars.  It was just good solid friendly Thai in a neighborhood with absolutely no Thai options and all the Thai options in surrounding hoods for miles around just being 3 star generic delivery Thai.  (Yes ""Carroll Gardens West"" has PokPok but despite all the hype it is very good not great and certainly not worth waiting in line for). Kao Soy is refreshing in that it offers dishes beyond your basic pad thai and curries, yet isn't so pretentious as to not serve these popular dishes.  Having spent some time in Thailand for work and learning more about the diverse flavors there, it is nice to have a place relatively nearby that offers these type of dishes.  For that alone Kao Soy gets extra points in my book. Even though we enjoyed Kao Soy, it wasn't one of those places where we felt the need or desire to rush back (it was just nice to know it was an option). In fact it was several weeks later until we gave it another try (this time for take out late on a Sunday night).  Well thanks to all the Yelp hype business was booming and we were quoted 45mns for a pick-up order.  When I got there the place was packed and chaotic.  When I asked about my order, they told me they need a few minutes more.  A few minutes turned into 20, 30, 45 minutes (which is a long time in this tiny restaurant).  The whole time the food pouring out to the kitchen looked and smelled delicious but every diner leaving was complaining about how long their meal took and how disorganized it was. In the end the 45 minutes I was quoted turned into a 1hr 45mns.  A bit crazy for take out Thai, but a testament to how well this place is doing.  The problem is that their kitchen is too small to handle the demand of a constant line of eat-in diners, delivery orders (which were clearly getting priority over take out), and take out.  Something has to give.  Either the hype will die down or they will do what most popular restaurants do and limit take out to certain hours.  I hate when places do this (yes, i am talking about you Frankies and your dreamy meatball sandwich which you are always too busy to do for takeout), but realize it is necessary to keep quality up. Okay, so getting all that out of the way, I am guessing you want to know more about the food.   -Just to get it out of the way, yes we tried the Pad Thai.  I know many will turn their nose up at ordering such a standard Thai dish, but we feel it is the litmus test for any Thai joint.  It's served with super thin angel hair pasta, which I had never seen done before (even in Thailand).  It was okay but nothing I would get again. -The Pad Kee Mao has a nice kick to it but again I wasn't loving the noodles. -Both the Pad Kraprow and Moo Pad Prik Khing are  super spicy and really really satisfying. We got the Pad Kraprow with squid (which is cooked to perfection). -At $18 the Steak Jim Jaew is twice the price of other dishes, but super tender and cooked to perfection. -The Kang Kiew Wan was good but probably wouldn't get again. -Unfortunately I can't remember the appetizer we got during our first visit. So yeh, Kao Soy is a solid 4.  It's a 10 for Red Hook since there are no other Thai options, but I could see people travelling from other boroughs/neighborhoods being disappointed.  Not that they won't enjoy their excellent meal, but that the hype might make it seem like they should be experiencing something more. By the way, the people who run the place are super nice and I could see it being more of a 5 star experience if you go mid-week on off hours and they are able to give their full attention.  My hat goes off to them for opening in this location and handling the chaos as well as they do.",725,1,0,,

We asked for a new order of buk choy.

So we asked to cancel the order. The response we got was ""ohhh ok. Do you want some dessert?"", with the waiter acting like nothing happened at all. Anyways, the food was pretty good.

Friendly staff, good but pricey burgers (I don't especially care for organic), and delicious KETCHUP. Yup. Ketchup. I always get their bison burger because I love the taste and I'm too scared to try anything else. Their menu changed from maybe a year ago? But the new menu looks just as good and tasty. I recommend the Southern Caviar made with bison, bacon, onions, horseradish on a brioche. Their fries and onion rings are pretty solid. Or solid grease. Either way, you're already devouring a 700 calorie burger so just splurge and go all the way to make this meal complete. I wouldn't recommend their sides of pickles for ~$3 though. The portion size was small and it wasn't impressive. Okay yeah so back to the ketchup. It definitely has to do with their organic tomatoes, cause their ketchup tastes out of this world FRESH compared to regular overly processed Heinz. And they know it too.

The caccio e pepe was a classic, but delicious dish! The squid ink risotto had good depth of flavor between the chunks of calamari and octopus, the lemon juice, and the hot peppers. For entrees, we had the duck and branzino with prawns. My friend loved the duck, but I felt like the branzino was average. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t bad, but based on the description of a lemongrass broth I expected a lot more flavor. For dessert, we shared the milk and cereal (very good and unique), the grapefruit matcha pavlova (really nice fresh flavor and great presentation), and the dirty chai and salted caramel ice cream (have had better, but still good). Oh and cocktails! We tried the Nestos and Rio Bravo. Both were fantastic and very reasonably priced.

Okay fine, so I found out the Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong was closed first then I resorted to Jongro. I needed a restaurant that was large enough for a party of 10 and wouldn&#39;t rush us out because space is tight so Jongro seemed to be perfect for this. I called a few days before the event and nagged a reservation for 10 on a Sunday evening at 5:30pm - easy, peasy lemon squeezy. <br><br>The day of the event I received a phone call around noon, which I had ignored because I thought it was a scammer. No voicemail left. Again this same number calls at 3pm to which I ignored once again. However this time I entered the number on Google and discovered it was Jongro and I called back immediately. They confirmed my reservation but wanted to know if separating my party of 10 into two tables was okay. I was very upset because I am being told of this 3 hours before the event that at our celebration dinner we will be sitting apart. How am I supposed to find another location last minute? The lady proceeds to tell me they have two tables for larger parties but usually the hostess/worker would call days in advance to confirm parties and for some reason no one called me so I no longer have that large table. Anyway I said I had no choice at this point but to keep the reservation and hung up. I called back a few minutes later to express my frustration to suddenly be told by a different lady that the woman I spoke to earlier was new and had no idea what she was talking about. That being said, my blood pressure had risen earlier all for naught.<br><br>Anyhow fast forward three hours later, we all arrived and were seated. It really is still two separate tables that were pushed together but its fine. We did not get the large tables as anticipated but as long as we fit and did not have to sit separately I suppose. Servers were very attentive and friendly. We ordered a large platter of beef and pork, several orders of seafood pancake, and a japchae.<br><br>I thought the seafood pancake and japchae were good. Standard, but tasty. I did however find the meat platters to be quite bland... perhaps needed some marinating. It was still quite yummy though after you add the onions, garlic, sauces, and such. That being said the meats really did come up short for me at least compared to other Korean barbecues I&#39;ve been to.

We came in on a Friday around 5:30, and there was literally one other table there. The completely humorless and dour waiter/bartender/sour-face-in-charge snobbily asked us if we had reservations. We politely told him no, and he said he could probably fit us in at the bar. Again, every single table and bar stool was empty with the exception of one. And it remained that way pretty much the entire hour we were there. The too cool for school guy said he would tell us about their happy hour, and mentioned only that they had $1 oysters, then went mute. I asked if they had any happy hour drinks and his speech function was restored long enough for him to say ""it wouldn't be happy hour without that."" Maybe that would be charming from someone with half a personality, but when it's delivered by an angry guy who's been straight up nasty to you for ten minutes, it's just more straight up nasty. We ordered oysters that were warm, bland and chewy. The rude sour facer asked if they were good and I gave him my honest response that they weren't great. His snob factor shot up to 1,000 and he started interrogating me about why, and where I had eaten oysters last. Not cool. Then the McDonald's burger with a $14 price tag arrived, and it was not as unappetizing as the oysters, but it was absolutely not anywhere near the best burger in the city, much less the neighborhood. The sangria was sickly sweet, the fries were meh, and when the busboy slammed into my arm with a huge plastic case of who knows what, he mumbled ""oh, sorry."" The sour facer and the waitress both saw and said nothing. Also, it looks like the inside of a dirty cheap hotel, anyone who says this place is cozy or cute needs to seriously get out more. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. And the service was just beyond bad - the sour facer should've taken the crappy oysters off the bill, but he left them on and offered zero apologies for them. We went down the street to Double Wide to have a decently made drink with infinitely better service. If you want a burger in the EV, do yourself a favor and RUN past this place and head a few blocks east to Royale, which has a far better product for half the price, and much fresher oysters to boot.

It's also the only thing I've had here, so I can't comment on any of the other menu items, I'm afraid. I've taken my mom here three mothers days in a row. That may not seem like a particularly classy mothers day gift, but we both love it and if she's happy on that day, I'm doubly happy. My mom was born in Scotland and my grandparents owned a fish and chips shop in Aberdeen. To us, the trip is all about the food. We like the decor (I love the Irish loo signs), the seating is comfortable and the music is well chosen and not so loud as to be obtrusive for normal conversation. Actually, it was here that another patron told me that Luka Bloom (whose music was playing at the time) is Christy Moore's brother. I had no idea! But really we come because the quality of the fare just gets it right in every way. I literally welled up at my very first bite of haddock, which was so plump and moist and warm and fresh inside of its perfectly crisp and not-oily-at-all shell of delicious batter. One bite precipitated an avalanche of nostalgia that continued through to the last morsel. The chips are traditional as well. Nothing fancy, which is not what you want anyhow. I ask for a side of curry (which they were able to provide most times) for dipping and then alternate between that and tartar sauce and the malt vinegar. Love a squeeze of lemon over the fish, a pinch of salt and nothing more. Just divine.

He now changed his story to ""this section is closed"".  Ok. Now we sit down in the main dining area and it's obvious that he didn't want to have the customers spread all about the ""huge"" restaurant. (I'm being sarcastic). So we start off with a bread basket with one little old lonely  piece of Italian bread that was rock hard. The waiter (same BS'r) comes to take our order. I ask for fresh bread and he immediately and defensively barks that this bread was delivered a half hour ago and IS fresh. My pal tells him that they need a new bread supplier if this is fresh bread. The busboy who overheard, discreetly brought us another bread tray. Smart guy. At the table next to us is 4 UPS drivers on their lunch break. The waiter (not ours) brought them garlic knots and some kind of bruschetta which she announced was ""on the house"".  What are we? Second class citizens?  Now, We order.  The food comes. Not very tasty. Nothing really wrong but nothing memorable. My friend thought the red sauce had an odd smell but it was digestible. At this point I notice the owner, wandering near the door, more interested in his cell phone than greeting or checking to see if customers are satisfied. My friend is mumbling about how he'll not return, purposely within earshot and loud enough to be noticed. The owner never gave him a second look. This place just relocated to this location from a block away. Pretty big investment. One would think he'd give some attention to new customers.  I got the feeling that if the waiter or waitress know you, don't expect even passable service. And the owner didn't seem to care.",361,0,0,,

The rest of my party's reception to the food varied, as two diners split the A-Gu Jim and were a bit disappointed with it, as they were expecting something different (don't ask me what they were expecting, though). Then again, my brother was immensely satisfied with his Hae Mool Dolsot Bibim Bap, so I guess the lesson is that you just have to know what you're ordering.

If you share, the wait time is cut down drastically and sometimes even no one at all. Unlike some other KBBQ restaurants, this one has dried beef jerky, chicken and pork which was very interesting. Definitely give it a try. On the down side, the sauce they provided for KBBQ was more on the liquid side so when you wrap up your meat in the lettuce it could slide down; there was also no soy bean paste for KBBQ (they do have a lot of sauce options for hot pot though).

I'd get it if we were still living in 2008. It's almost 2016. There are too many new Asian and Asian fusion restaurants coming out with their own version of the ramen. It is so rare to find a bowl that stands out. I was a fan of Ippudo's first location in St. Mark's, back in 2006 (?) 2007 (?) and decided to give their new west side location a try. Of course, there is a wait. It does not matter what time you decide to go, there will always be a wait. I've waited everywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes. Like their St. Mark's location, the waiting area is right by the bar. They also sell paraphernalia at this part of the restaurant.   You can also leave your name and phone number with the hostess, and she'll text you once your table is ready. It's great. You can walk along 8th Avenue, and find yourself a bar to kill time. As soon as you enter, there is a huge communal table that can seat approximately 25 people. They usually seat couples or solos at this table. And don't be scared to eat at either of the Ippudo locations by yourself. I've seen quite a number of people eating solo at both locations. There is also a separate seating area for bigger parties aka for parties of 3 and more. We always start with their pork buns. Juicy, soft, but expected. Nothing extraordinary. We've also had their Hirata Chicken Wings. It is marinated in a saltier black pepper sauce and served with raw cabbage to offset the kick. Good, a little dry, but flavorful. Ramen is ramen.

I also had the California roll.  Not as great as they could make it- it smelled overly fishy, but I really didn't have a problem because I did use my yelp deal (which is not combinable with your edamame check in offer).   Also the staff was super friendly.  I dropped my chopsticks like twice and they replaced it immediately without the slightest bit of annoyance.  Even opened it and took it apart for me! The bathroom was tiny but also super super clean.   The only thing I didn't like was that the bar was very close to tables as with most places they usually keep a few feet away.  This bar was close to the point where there were toddlers playing with the bar chairs- which really shouldn't be allowed.

The restaurant itself was beautiful. Moreover, the staff was immediately welcoming and celebratory, and upon being seated our hostess, Lauren, and server, Josh, brought complimentary champagne to our table for the occasion. (I signed up for a Yelp account to write this review, and I also called White Street to make sure I could thank both Lauren and Josh by name in this review). Our first two courses were perfectly prepared, and our whole party could not have been more satisfied by the food we were served. As we looked at the desserts menu, we decided to order three items. At this point, Lauren approached our table, again congratulated us, and said that the pastry chef had outdone himself, and decided to celebrate with us. Soon thereafter, each of us was presented with a yuzu/ginger amuse-bouche confection not on the menu (it should be. The yuzu dessert was simply fantastic), followed by the full dessert menu appearing at our table. Again, everything was fantastic. And then, as we prepared the cheque, Josh and Lauren once more appeared, this time with a flight of chocolate truffles and cookies (my husband swears that the cookie was, and I quote, ""the best chocolate cookie I have ever eaten""). Truly, White Street made an already fantastic day even better, and we will be talking about this for years.

It did not have all the Fresh vegetables that were supposed to be on top& it was on a gluten free bun that was so freezer burned that I just pushed it to the side.   They did not ensure the safety of my allergy because I was sick halfway through my meal, meaning that there was a lack of care with cross contamination in the kitchen.

The only thing I wouldn't get again were the additional olives, there were a few too many to eat mixed in with the salad, but they were quality olives, and I saved a bunch of them for later. I also tried their deliciously evil Sweet Potato Fries $3.75. They were a nice thick cut and a hearty serving. I selected the creamy garlic dipping sauce because you only live once..

Ordered a burger, the sweetbreads special, and an eclair. The burger was missing the cheese and the sweetbreads came with a completely different side than what was listed on the Seamless menu (peas and lima beans instead of red cabbage and apples). This all after about 1.5 hour of waiting. I called and Joe told me the menu was wrong about the sides for the sweetbreads (hadn't been updated) and he would send a new burger and a complimentary side. Okay, fine, it happens. Also, be aware that all desserts are tasting-sized (so more of a half-eclair - again, would be nice if the menu actually said so). The reason I am writing this review, however, is that the food was basically awful, which is not excusable at these prices. The sweetbreads were completely bland and could barely be cut with a knife. I ended up eating maybe half. The fries tasted like nothing. The burger was blah and not done quite right, but it wasn't gross like the sweetbreads.

I didn't go there for the food, but the pork dumplings (fried and steamed), the duck spring rolls, the pork belly, the bacalhau and the brussels sprouts were all quite tasty. The drinks were the highlight though. Naturally we sat at the bar; Alejandro and Steve held it down, shaking and stirring up magic and trouble.

Visit one: A gin-soaked rage spun me reeling through the drizzling rain spattered 3AM streets crookedly working my way east to dump what remained of my hubris in the river. Stymied by a fence and the FDR drive, I swung west on 116 found this place. Open. Pig-meat man with a juicy pineapple head on a spit.  One small table near the rear door had twenty some people gathered around it. Tourists, I think. From Brooklyn? I stood between condiment trays at the shelf on the wall. Life-saving. Perfect. Fresh, Searing capsaicin condiments. Meat might have been chopped in the equatorial sun on worn tree stump by a border town street vendor. Sated. Sobering. While standing in the middle of the restaurant I was propositioned by someone on the sidewalk holding a photograph of a child. She wanted to give me beer so that I would give her money to buy milk for her child. When I left, her husband walked with me for two blocks. Trying to convince me to come up to his home, where he claimed he'd ply me with cervezas and discuss the nutritional needs of his daughter. Sober, I declined his invitation and skipped home. Visit Two: Sunny. Noon. Weekday. Five people seated at the rear table. Tourists - I know: had guide books). No pineapple. Overly dry meat. Fresh Condiments, though standing with 3 other people at the bar made for less accessible augmentation of my tacos.   Regretting that I walked 4 blocks, but with satisfying gristle between my teeth and hot endorphine breath, I re-entered the sunshine with a smile (then went to Costco to buy a big bin of humus and a fan). Visit Three: Brought my 8 year-old daughter. She practiced her spanish. She was uncomfortable upon entering the place and brazenly proclaimed (loudly) the food disgusting before she even tasted it. I chastised her and attempted to elicit discretion from her trepidation. The full table in the back was taken aback. We stood. I demanded she at least taste it. She spat it out. I tasted it. It was disgusting.  We continued our lesson in tact outside. I've walked by several times. I tell friends to go. I rave about the reviews I've read here on yelp. Conclusion?

We requested the sesame noodles and singed eggplant since they appeared to be well known, and they were acceptable yet not incredible. Sesame noodles were entirely sleek/pungent, and the sweet sauce on the eggplant was very acceptable however the peanuts sort of overpowered the remainder of the dish.

Also, for the chicken teriyaki, while you do get a lot of food, the chicken is a bit dry and all white meat. Good for those being healthy but not good if you're looking for satisfying tummy food. The veggies underneath were a little under cooked in my opinion but if you like crisp green beans, that these veggies are your thing. All in all, we would go back because it's so convenient, comfortable, and generally tasty. But please watch out for that tuna.",229,0,,,

When I first started to get their voicemail messages, I ignored them, until finally one day I was home, possibly tired after a long day, and I answered the phone.  That was my first mistake.  After a brief interview conducted by an energetic young sounding woman, I agreed, and paid the $2,800 on a credit card.  She told me IJL is a global company, that they have a pool of clients from around the world, and that by early the following week, I'd have my first date.  She left out a lot of important information about IJL. During the interview, I specifically said I did not want to date a man who was never married.  I am 65 and feel it raises a red flag if a man is between 58 and 73 and never married.  I also prefer someone with adult children, retired or still working, and NOT live in New York.  New York people don't like to come to New Jersey, ever.  I completely understand.   My fiasco started on May 1, and I've yet to go on a date.  First I had to meet with a face to face IJL person.  This was one of my early disagreements.  I was originally told IJL had an office in Fort Lee, where I live, however when it came time for the ftf meeting I was told that my option was Princeton, a 90 minute drive, NYC or someplace out on Long Island.  Actually the person trying to schedule the meeting argued with me that the location was just a few miles away.  Clearly, she knows nothing about the logistics of commuting into NYC.  The person I had my ftf with was one of two people I've dealt with who was honest.  He lives in jersey City, and completely understood why I did not want to date someone from NYC.   I placed a number of calls and sent emails which were unanswered, even one hang up when I mentioned my name, and when I sent an email and cc'd every employee I had dealt with, someone from Management called me, and I was given a new dating search specialist to work with.  She has also been honest with me, and told me my hub is NYC, and there's nothing that can be done about it.  Now, I'm waiting for a call from Management.   One last thing.  Twice they wanted to fix me up with the same person, 67 years old, never married, no children.  Then there was a man who only graduated from high school, and now another man, never married, no children.  I don't think they know how to listen, or anything about being in a service industry. So, here it is, 6 weeks into a 6 month membership, and not a date insight. I hope my review saves someone, anyone from the aggravation I've been dealing with.",513,1,,,

Mixologist Ion provided the drinks this time once again accommodating my gf's indecisiveness. For appetizers we had the fish tacos and short rib which were made to perfection. For our main course we had the Skirt Steak and Black Cod both with compliments that added to the dance party in your mouth where no one stood on the wall!

I'd been to this place a few years ago for a birthday party. Recently my girlfriend and I came back to celebrate her passing her medical board exams.

After playing an hour of pool we cashed out so we wouldn't still be charged for playing (we had ordered drinks and food while playing) our waitress did not provide the best of service but fine... We paid with our cards and I told my friend we'd hang around and get drinks play air hockey and I'd tip later. So we didn't leave tip on our cards. Because we didn't explicitly state our intentions to the cashier (you can leave your tip at the front if you want) it turned into fodder for gossip. The waitress then found us to ask why we didn't leave her a tip! Something that's never happened to me. We were still there and you either get tip of not, you don't come ask why with attitude to make it mandatory whether or not you gave good service.

We'd spent $74.00 at the space and had every intention of tipping AFTER we'd finished drinking and enjoying ourselves. The way Richard was acting however was as though he was a Pimp protecting his merchandise. It was really inappropriate.

I ordered their famous Caramelized Banana Ice Cream Tower and it really wasn't all that great. The ""tower"" was too sweet and the bananas inside it were too mushy (not caramelized at all). The banana ice cream was so-so...the consistency was on the gummy side for me. My other gripe would the seating arrangements. For such a massive restaurant, they made sure to cram a table in every space that they can! I hate restaurants that do this because if I'm paying top money to dine there then the last thing I want is to be elbow to elbow with the other diners. If I can hear the conversation of the people in the tables next to me then there's a problem. The service was fast and friendly. The clientele was definitely on the rich, snooty side so make sure you dress appropriately. I will probably come back again but only for a very special (expensive) date.",227,0,,,

Always wonder at the crazy long line so I decided to pay a visit on weekend. It was about 1pm on Saturday, took 20 mins to stand in line and made the order. I was kinda disappointed about the appearance of the salmon, which looked weird and not so fresh, and due to the rising concern of parasites in salmon, I barely choose salmon in sushi restaurants, thus I chose the unami classic tuna bowl. I was underwhelmed by the bland taste of the tuna at the first bite, I could only taste the strong sesame oil and soy sauce. Moreover, compared to the ahi tuna I tried in Hawaii, the watermelon pinkish tuna and mushy flesh led me to a suspicious thought of what kind of tuna I was eating. I started some researches when I back home, I'm totally stunned by what I had found. The actual, natural color of ahi tuna should be chocolate or brown. I highly doubt that they are selling CO (carbon monoxide) treated tuna, the cheapest tuna grade in market, which always looks watermelon pink no matter how unfresh it is. Also, the more I looked into the establishment of this new restaurant, I realized that it probably just another sushi restaurant operated by Chinese. No offense to the race, I would avoid eating in any Chinese background sushi restaurant since most of them used the cheapest and unfresh sashimi in market, especially many people just don't know how to differentiate between variety of raw fishes (most seafoods do taste ok to many people while they're blended with sauces though). Not only Pokerworks, many restaurants claimed themselves using sustainably sourced fish but there is no law requiring them to show or prove their sources, so I guess it is just a yet-to-be-proven marketing slogan. Considering the high rent in Midtown office area, I understand it is unlikely that restaurants could provide REAL fresh sashimi at only $11 a bowl. But for the customers' , I think we should educate ourselves more on the basis of food safety and learn to make better choice. What bring up the hype are just the lack of choice for lunch in Midtown and marketing. $11 for a bowl of parasites and unfresh sashimi? I would get rid of it forever.",403,1,,hype,

I am comparing their green sauce to the one served by the taco vans, the taco van sauce beats this one by far! The tacos served at this mom and pop shop is the best one I&#39;ve tasted so far for the Richmond hill and south ozone park area. <br><br>I was going to continue coming here until the waitress tried pulling a smart one on my family and I. We ordered 4 tacos and 1 quesadilla. She takes our order and comes back with our cutlery and a plate of guacamole and chips, along with salsa and the green sauce. We never ordered the guacamole, and we told her as such, she says no it&#39;s complimentary. So we go ahead and eat it, next thing you know we get the bill and she decides to charge us $5.50 for the guacamole. We asked her why she charged us for the guacamole, she said because we ate it. But she told us earlier that it was complimentary??? We just paid the bill and left because she decided to not understand English at that moment.

I don't remember where and why I came across this particular episode (probably got my otaku friends to thank) but I very clearly recall this little  12 year oldish girl, possibly 18 in Asian years, with angel wings on her back and running wildly down her animated street chewing on this cakey fish thing. I soon learned it was called Taiyaki. Um. The cakey fish thing. Not the anime. Because c'mon what's more important*. ==== review begins ==== Mitsuwa Market's taiyaki shop is one of those memorable places that fullfilled my ""I dont know what that is but I wanna put that sh*t into my mouth"" fantasies. Taiyaki looked good in cartoons, now it tastes good in my mouth.  But of course, Mitsuwa is not just one shop or two, it is a marketplace comprising an entire aisle of food vendors and a supermarket for Japanese goods. There are 4 things to do here: 1) The supermarket section - tons of Japanese snacks you can't find in your neighborhood at reasonable prices! If you are buying Japanese snacks at the same place where they sell body sized girl pillows, you need to stop getting ripped off and come to Mitsuwa stat. Yes I was once that guy. Now I pay below 4 dollars for new Pocky flavors. Life is good. Yea they have other supermarkety stuff here but I only care about sweets. 2) Food vendors - Santouka Ramen is the big boy in here so be sure to give them a try. You can also get other stuff like steak, rice, curry, sushi etc but in my opinion Santouka is the best. And Taiyaki. Bring the food to the food court and eat it. 3) Events - There are events held here so be sure to check their website to see if there are events that interest you. They recently had a bluefish tuna cutting event. Mmmmm 4) Car accessory shop - Omfg. You can get cute car accessories here. Hello kitty driving wheels, pichacho arm rests, pink floor mats... If you need to cutify your car, you need to visit this shop. If you are a guy, its not girly if you're Asian. If you're like me, who likes Japanese stuff... not figurines but real stuff like awesome rice cookers, green tea flavored snacks, and other things pertaining to food - definitely come to Mitsuwa for a good time. *Holy fucking shit. By googling ""taiyaki angel wings girl anime"" I got the anime I was looking for. The power of google. I feel like a piece of my childhood memory has been restored thanks to my urge to write Yelp reviews. Aguu~ Hrmm I think I ranted about sweets and cute things more than I should.

The service was great but everything took forever. The kitchen was definitely having trouble keeping up with the brunch service. <br><br>To start we ordered a Pastry Basket which was supposed to include the chocolate croissant, queen&#39;s cake and another puffed pastry with gruyere cheese. That puffed pastry they had sold out of by the time we ordered so we never got to try it. But our waiter did try his best to find one, even going to the hotel kitchen to see if they had any left for their patrons! It took a really long time to get the other pastries but it was worth the wait. The chocolate croissant was perfect. The star was the queen&#39;s cake which i don&#39;t remember the French name. It is puffed pastry with butter and sugar served warm! We loved it so much! <br><br>For meals, my brother had the Ouef Special which was two poached eggs served on potato pancakes with a creamy hollandaise sauce and tomato jam at the recommendation of our server. It was the star of the brunch. I kept using his sauce on my egg&#39;s because it was that good.  I had the regular breakfast with 2 eggs, bacon, potato pancake and toast. The toast is great. The eggs lacked flavor and were bland but once you add salt and pepper it was good! The potato pancake is scrumptious. It has no onions which I loved because I hate onions and is just crispy delicious potato!!

Missed out on some sauces, veggies and rices but I'll formulate my plan of attack per next visit. Action: Meats were cooked in intervals and the server would periodically visit to assist with the changing of grills and carving of meats. This was my 1st time drinking Soju & I'm not a big drinker.

It's great that there's a newer, cuter  restaurant featuring different Asian foods. Had take-out from here once, and ate here once. Take out: I was craving curry, but I ended up getting the Nasil Lemak Bowl (anchovies crisps, sambal, roasted peanuts, cucumbers, egg, coconut-pandanus rice - mild). It was better than I expected! The anchovies were sweet, salty, and crispy - such a good side to the meal. The peanuts were a great addition for texture. The rice was delicious and went perfectly with the samba (which was so yummy!) This was without a doubt the best dish I've gotten from Wok Wok. One of my friends got the Char Keow Teow (rice noodles, eggs, chive, bean sprouts - mildly spicy) and another got the Drunk Man Noodle (rice noodles, onions, eggs, tomato, bell pepper - say mild, but I would say more toward medium). The two rice noodle dishes were both yummy, nothing special, it was what I expected- nothing more nothing less. Dine in: I convinced my boyfriend to go down to Wok Wok to sit and eat after my excitement from eating the Nasil Lemak Bowl (take out). I expected the food I ordered to be just as good, if not better, when I was eating in. The interior is very cute, nothing fancy- casual. The table setting could've been more done up, but who cares, right? We started off with the Crispy Wonton, which was mediocre. Not bad, but definitely not worth what you pay. I wouldn't get it again. For the entree, I got the Sarang Burong Birds Nest Special (""Crispy formed taro filled with shrimp, chicken, veggies and topped with roasted cashews.""). The taro nest was very unique, cool to look at, and might I add- HUGE. Everything inside the nest was SO BLAND! It surprised me how tasteless the shrimp, chicken, and veggies were... I was hoping for something as flavorful as the Nasil Lemak Bowl, or at least something that had a good amount of salt and pepper, maybe some chili? Pretty disappointing. $13.95 for a bland, sad dish. My boyfriend, being a basic dude, got the General Tso Chicken. It definitely wasn't bland, but it wasn't good. Any random Chinese take-out place would've been better. Dessert was somewhat exotic and yummy. It couldn't quite save the day, but it made our experience slightly better. We had the Chendol Durian: sweet, satisfying, multi-textured, cold dessert. I love how they incorporated durian into an iced dessert, which can be seen in many of the dessert places in Chinatown, but not many other places in NYC.

I took a much needed break from Coach House for about a year after a particularly awful experience (which wasn't the first time I walked out of there feeling frustrated) and I just recently decided to give them another chance. Which was clearly a mistake. Last year, my boyfriend and I went for dinner and I ordered a shrimp special. There wasn't much of a description on the menu of what the meal included, except that it came with choice of rice or pasta. The waitress, without hesitation, described the dish as shrimp with sauteed veggies in a red sauce and went on about how delicious it was. Okay, not normally what I order at a diner, but I was trying to be healthy so I went with it. The dinner included salad bar so I picked a few things from the bar and snacked on it before my meal came. The waitress brought out my food- shrimp in a buttery cream sauce with not a single vegetable. She disappeared so I couldn't get her attention and by the time she came back around, my boyfriend was almost done with his food. I tasted the shrimp, but I detest cream sauce unless it's done right, and this sauce was disgusting. I complained to the waitress when she finally reappeared and she offered to bring something else, but I didn't want to make my boyfriend wait and I was so aggravated, I just wanted to leave. We get the bill and see that these jerks had the nerve to charge me for the salad bar, which I hardly even touched and they refused to take it off the bill. You see why I didn't go back for so long? So just last week I went to Coach House for breakfast. I ordered an omelet with veggies and cheese. After the longest wait for breakfast I've ever had at a diner on a weekday morning, the kitchen forgot the cheese on my omelet. I complained and the waiter went to the kitchen, chopped up my omelet with a fork and threw a piece of cheese on top without even bothering to melt it (SEE PICTURES!) I complained AGAIN and he reluctantly asked me if I wanted them to make a new omelet. Since my grandma was halfway through her meal and considering how long it took for the food to come out in the first place, I once again told them to forget it.

Just the other day my colleagues pointed Balducci's out to me and suggested I grab lunch there. I rarely eat bread or pasta (unless an Italian lover is making it for me from scratch). Do you know how hard it is to find a bite to eat in an airport that doesn't have bread? I love most of the things *in* all the sandwiches, but I just. can't.... (why do Americans eat SO MUCH bread, anyway?) Balducci's has a bit of everything: fresh fruit, packaged specialty snacks, three types of hot soup, fresh deli sandwiches, those seemingly healthy, expensive, fancy bottled juices and several types of 7 oz. containers of delicious specialty 'salads.' Their Crunchy Vegetable Salad was DELICIOUS! (pardon me for yelling a bit there.) I had my eye on a chicken curry salad wrap, but I knew I would tear off and discard the tortilla. I asked the nice man that greeted me when I walked in if it would be possible to just have the chicken curry salad in a 7 oz. container instead of in the packaged wrap, and he cheerfully obliged. The employees there seemed kind, which is appreciated. My only complaint: Upon reading the list of ingredients in the chicken curry salad, I'm saddened to see that high fructose corn syrup is used, as well as an orange marmalade (yum! What a surprise!) that also contains high fructose corn syrup. Barducci's, can you do better than this? My guess is that most of your customers care about keeping this ingredient out of their food. I don't eat a lot, and I want what I do choose to eat to be of high quality in taste and nutrition.

The service was also friendly and prompt. When we left, at least three members of the staff in addition our waiter thanked us and wished us a good evening (but they were also all men... hmmm).

First, their crazy-huge menu is a little confusing and disorganized, but there's something for everyone.  Their Mediterranean selections are a must-try, the portions are MAMMOTH--we both took half of our dinners home.  I'd tried their Tijuana burger with avocado and bacon (Companion C: ""That sounds illegal."") before, a delight to behold for sure, but watch out: their burgers come with those big steak fries.  Last night, Companion C had a chicken quesadilla with seasoned fries, which were perhaps the most delicious waffle-cut fries I've ever eaten.  It's like they were battered in pure liquid gold, dusted with diamonds and fried to a crisp in sunlight.   The chicken quesadilla was hefty, my chicken kebob dinner nearly paralleled my favorite Afghani restaurant's in taste, but not presentation--you get a pile of buttered rice with chunks of herbed, spiced chicken breast and hearty veggies in a huge bowl.  Definitely, Green Kitchen has volume for the above-average diner prices.  Try their vinagrette salad dressing, Companion C and I ended up dipping the melba toasts from their complimentary bread basket into it because it's herbaliciously good. The decor is cheerful and charming, with photos of previous Green Kitchens' signage covering the walls around the window seating.  It's just too bad that there is fuck-all going on at the intersection of 1st Ave and 77th, because their window seating is GREAT for people-watching!  Green Kitchen also has brunch, a pretty good and non-scuzzy idea for lazy Saturday afternoons when I wake up at 2 pm in need of French toast, stat. My only complaint is that both times I've been here, the manager/host is extremely strange and rude--he yells into a hands-free phone headset and completely ignores customers waiting to pay at the register, then looks confused and angry when you try to hand him money.  What is going on, buddy?  Calm down and buck up, I am happily paying $15 for dinner at A DINER.  Our waiter was extremely bubbly, perhaps a little overexuberant so much that when he dove in to thank us profusely for dining at Green Kitchen, he stabbed me in the knee with his pen.",407,0,,,

After leaving the Apollo theater we wanted to find a place with good reviews and ended up here. My thoughts: $18.95 for 2pc fried chicken and two sides is OVERPRICED. A basket of cornbread was included too, not drinks. Water was free. We also shared 1 slice of what was supposed to be red velvet cake... that was the box, burgundy brown and not true Authentic ReD velvet cake. That was disappointing as well seeing how once slice was $7. There was about a 15-20 minute wait as well. Also, the bathrooms were down in basement, you had to go down two sets of stairs to get to it. Not sure what those with disabilities would do..I worried about that if someone that was wheelchair bound. Hopefully this review is helpful. Chicken, cornbread and sides were pretty good though.<br><br>@whoever responded from restaurant.. the red velvet cake was not authentic...made from scratch . My aunt that lives in GA makes it from scratch. And as for the wait, I was more displeased by the cake taste and the OVERPRICED entree. And to address the restrooms being in the basement... no one directed me restrooms ground level. The hostess told me they were to the right downstairs so no I DIDN&#39;T miss them. And having a child with disabilities I thought of her with the stairs if I was to return with her. Thanks",251,0,,,

Then we got these lightly fried rice balls which had rice, mozzarella, and veggies - they kind of tasted like that those frozen pizza bites from totinos.  No real flavor - but crispy and warm which was nice.

We like to consider ourselves amateur foodies (in that we both eat a lot) and this Gordon Ramsay spot seemed like a good RW choice. And my friend ate at his restaurant in London and raved about it. Firstly, my pet peeve is a maitre'd that appears disinterested when you walk in the door. If you don't want customers for Restaurant Week, then don't participate. We were seated and given the RW menu, however we had been considering ordering off the a la carte menu or choosing the $70 chef's tasting menu as we were a little under-whelmed by the entree choices on the RW menu. We had to ask for the non-RW menu and after deciding on a cocktail, for $17, we decided to go with the RW menu. (The cocktail by the way was fairly forgettable). By this stage, we had had three different waitstaff serve us. This doesn't bother me personally but it was an odd experience. I had the squash soup for appetizer, which was quite bland unusually considering it came with a duck and truffle ragut and my companion had the marinated beetroot and goat cheese, which she remarked also tasted bland, more like ricotta than goats cheese. We both chose the ribeye for entree, which was tasty when paired with the horseradish creme fraiche although we have had much better steaks at less fancy establishments. We were both taken aback by the broccoli rabe, which on the menu was just listed as ""sauteed broccoli rabe"", which had a strong fish taste. When we asked our waitress what it had been cooked in she said ""olive oil"", when I remarked it tasted fishy, she said ""oh that's the anchovy butter"". Feel like that should go on the menu as a lot of people have an aversion to the taste of anchovies. My dessert, the chocolate fondant, was average and my companion's vanilla custard was boring. All in all, we were incredibly underwhelmed by our experience. The service was awkward, food was average at best, however the bathrooms were very nice.",374,0,,,

My friend's quote that I've been trying to digest (pun completely intended) since the four of us had dinner at Bar Boulud on a very mild Saturday evening in February. And I still think I need some Alka Seltzer. This was not the review I was expecting to write -- or ever wanted to write. But it's never too late for a little discipline and objectivity when it comes to these matters. I admittedly walked into Bar Boulud full of anticipation and -- dare I say -- a bit star struck. But my knowledge of Daniel Boulud, in reality, is purely second hand reviews, official biography, and television appearances depicting a seasoned chef who seems like a nice guy.  And certainly a chef with undeniable skill and pedigree -- someone who paid his dues, excelled beyond most others, and richly deserves to enjoy the fruits of his labors at this stage of his career and life. So I stared at the online menu for weeks in advance -- ""what do I get, what do I get, what do I give up"" -- completely uncertain about a decision even as I was sitting down in a timely fashion for our reservation. And then I was handed the real menu -- a shabby relic encased in crinkled and somewhat hazy plastic...the kind of plastic that your old Aunt used to cover her living room couch in back in the 1970s. But -- on to the offerings.  No surprises.  Everything online was on there.  For the four of us, we order the escargot, tartare, and black/white sausage sampler.  A pretty good start.  Escargot, flavor-wise, was familiar and hard to mess up...garlicky, tender snails, but the little potato croquettes were remarkably bland in desperate need of salt. Tartare packed some flavor. Boudin sampler -- just okay.  Small portion for $30 (and I usually don't take price into consideration); the noir not unlike some well-sourced morcilla that I could warm up at home. The blanc was blanc. Mains:  My wife had the Frenchie burger for $23.  Ordinary.  I had the mussels -- small portion and very ordinary (as were the frites). My one friend had the Coq au Vin, which she thoroughly enjoyed, though we all felt the lardons were a bit square and chunky and, given their chewy, greasy, fatty bite, could use additional rendering. I personally thought the dish needed more sauce on the plate, as well.  And my other friend had the pasta with rabbit ragu.  And we had a first:  I have never been at a table where one of my dinner companions needed to send a pasta dish back because -- wait for it -- the pasta wasn't cooked enough.  And he was right -- that stuff was crunchy.  Even the most rigorous fan of al dente could not deny that those noodles were crunching like pretzels. They returned the dish a tad more cooked -- but just barely.  Most certainly a reheat (in contrast to the waiter confirming, ""okay so you want the same dish prepared but the pasta should be cooked more.""  Yes was the answer....but a new dish was not prepared...the old dish was repaired...sort of...not). Desserts and coffee were subsequently ordered, and much to our regret.  The sporadic service to this point just simply disappeared. We were all finished with our coffees long before a hint of anything sweet showed up.  We were ready to cancel the order when the guy came out with plates in hand.  And we accepted them.  I think sometimes we are too nice. Having enjoyed a great day in the city (""Book of Mormon' matinee -- it's funny as hell, but be prepared to take a joke no matter who or what you are or believe!) and incredible weather for February in NYC, we left saying good things to each other about the meal. But the benefit of a good night's sleep and 20-20 hindsight brought some much needed and justified perspective.   It's been a lot of years since Le Cirque for Chef Boulud. He commands an empire, not a kitchen, these days.And it pains me to say that what we experienced is not something he would be proud of.  Said another way:  Bar Boulud can and should do better.  Much better.",735,0,,,

But let me step back for a second. We've lived in BPC for about a year now, but just made it to North End Grill this Saturday night. For some reason, when we first looked at the dinner menu a while back, it didn't seem like something we were into. And, when we've walked by the restaurant and peered into the dining area, it seemed a bit stuffy for a BPC place. But alas! Somehow we overlooked the bar menu, and the bar area of the restaurant, until now. Once we looked at this portion of the menu, we were psyched. And decided to give it a shot. As soon as we walked in, we felt like it was a good decision. Bar area has a great vibe-- very chill, low key, and casual. One of the biggest benefits to sitting in the bar area (in addition to the above, and avoiding the more formal dining area) is that you get to look right into the open kitchen. Just adds a nice element to the dining experience. Service is attentive and fast. We arrived a little before 8pm on Saturday, and we were seated immediately. Drink orders were taken and delivered minutes later. Same case for an appetizer of charred peppers (which were excellent). A quick note on drinks. They have a few great beers on tap (personal fan of the IPA) and my wife got an excellent Australian wine. They seem to be known for their Scotch selection (an entire menu page devoted to this beverage), so I'll be sure to sample next time around. On to the main entrees-- I had the short rib burger, and my wife sampled a few apps, including the squash and Maine lobster salad. Everything was ridiculously amazing. Burger, I already covered. My wife loved everything she had. One of the best meals we've had in recent memory, in a city known for amazing meals. Definitely heading back soon, even though it is a little pricey.

Plus, their Hainanese chicken rice is cheaper than Eim Khao Mun Kai, costing $6.25 for one.  Overall, if I compared to Pulao Penang, this would be better.",186,0,,,

My father was at NYU Hospital recovering from back surgery. He asked my brother and I to get him something to eat and a smoothie. My baby bro heard of a spot on St. Marks Place that is considered a healthy eating spot so we made the trek down 2nd Ave from 17th Street. Along the way my brother mentioned he wanted doughnuts and I remember reading about Doughnut Plant. Living in Jersey for sometime I am a little off whenever roaming around the lower part of Manhattan, so I did a quick search and bam... we were only blocks away; 12 to be exact. The plan was to grab a doughnut and pick up my Dad's food on the way back; simple enough right? Well, after one doughnut my brother and I decided we needed to try another. It was a brisk October day so we figured why not have a cup of joe while we're at it. Besides, coffee and doughnuts go together. Once we stuffed our faces with two delicious doughnuts we had no choice but to try one more. Now we are here savoring every single bite. This is before the recently added tables and chairs. We were enjoying out treats real city style; on our feet, and our coffee on the window seal next to us. If we had the time we would have tried every single doughnut in the store, but that would just be pure gluttony. So we just ordered everything else to go!! Being the considered sons we are, we figured our dad, who told us to find him a health food store, might want a few doughnuts. :) Just saying, maybe. My recent visits to Doughnut Plant came the weekend before, and after Christmas. You can never recreate your first memory but the doughnuts were still good.  I like how there is jam in every single bite. Peanut-Butter and jelly is one of my favorite snacks, I am glad Doughnut Plant was able to turn my favorite snack into doughnut.",353,0,,,

As you approach the glistening lights, the excitement builds, and you can't help but become distracted by the other three other Indian restaurants surrounding (also covered in lights). As you head up the stairs (Panna II is on the top right), the owners of the competing neighboring restaurants stand outside, and try to summon you to try to their restaurant. It is something you must experience to believe. Keep in mind, you must know which place you'll be dining in beforehand or you will be overwhelmed to say the least. In my case, it's always been Panna II! The food is satisfying, flavorful, cheap, and you can bring your own wine or beer. The service is surprisingly good, despite the insanely cramped space. But, you can't help but smile when dining at Panna II. The entire restaurant is covered, literally covered, in hanging christmas and chili lights, and birthday celebrations are quite a surprise for your first experience. Kyle and I have been to Panna II many times since our first visit last March. We love their chicken tikka masala, and crave their onion chutney that they serve complimentary with papadum, an indian style crispy cracker. They offer a large selection of different curries, among a long list of appetizers and traditional Indian dishes, including vindaloo and tandoori. Be sure to get the vegetable samosas and the garlic and onion naan -- both excellent canvases for the bold flavors of the onion chutney. While I will always be a loyal customer to Panna II, I must give an honest review in saying that this past Sunday I was a bit disappointed compared to my other Panna II experiences. We ordered chicken tikka masala and were served vindaloo, but they brushed it off and said it was tikka masala (nope, sorry, but I've been here too many times and know this isn't tikka masala). The dish was still good, but was surprised they didn't exchange it. The service also wasn't up to their usual excellent standards, and had to ask the waiter for water on multiple occasions (my mouth was on fire from the vindaloo). Granted they were busy, but usually the waitstaff is so on their game, even when it's a full house. With the outlier exception of my latest Panna II experience, I recommend this place to anyone who is a fan of Indian food or really even someone looking for an interesting restaurant experience. It's sure to be a fun night that won't break the bank, though remember, they are cash only. Great for group of people, a date, and especially a birthday celebration...

The burgers used to be a good size for the price, but as you can see in some of the other reviewers pictures, they are small now. The only reason I go here anymore is because it is one of the only places in FH that is baby-friendly. That being said, this place is fine. The new frozen blood orange margaritas are great!! Although, they stopped putting a slice of blood orange in the glass for some reason. Much better than at the mexican spot a few doors down.

3792288,2021-06-11,Qo8Qv4szVRhHUarvz9Qdrg,jollibee-woodside,5.0,I don&#39;t understand why this place has such okay ratings. I think Jollibee a has one of the best fast food fried chicken when compared to other fast food places. This place gets absolutely packed during lunch and dinner time. Their signature chicken ( highly recommend the spicy version) comes with a cup of gravy. This simple addition makes me wonder why all chicken places don&#39;t offer gravy with their chicken. It elevates the dish so much. Also try out their chicken sandwich and palabok which are consistently tasty. Finish off with their mango or ube pie which is much better than what McDonald&#39;s have to offer.,107,1,,,

I had a Groupon for a wine tasting, dinner and a bottle of wine for two. We made an early reservation, for 5:30, which is when they open. We sat at the bar and were able to eat our dinner there. We started with an antipasto plate, which we each received. It consisted of some salami, cheese, bread and olives. Everything was yum, if not the fanciest, but delicious. Next were our main courses, which we got to pick from the entrees on the menu. I had the hangar steak, which came sliced on top of deliciously done mashed potatoes and a side of vinaigrette dressed salad. My steak was cooked well and the dish was yum. My friend had the chicken and also agreed her food was fab. Our groupon came with a tasting and the bartender started us with the reds and ended with the whites. The wines were ok, 1 I really liked, but what do you really expect for the price you pay. This isn't Circo, people. We also got a bottle to take home, which also was just ok. But, I was pleasntly buzzed and really enjoyed myself, so no complaints here.  The bartender was the perfect amount of friendly w/o being annoying. I wish I had gotten his name to recognize his good service here. His service did get slow , however in his defense I must say this place filled up quickly and he was quite busy.  It was packed with people waiting to sit by the time we left at 8;30. Yes, we spent 3 hours there and despite it being extremely busy, we were not rushed for our table. The bathroom is downstairs and is clean. The place is small. It does have seating at the bar, tables further down from the bar and a back room with tables, as well. This would be a great spot for a date.

Village site and in Williamsburg.   The Pad Thai was always serviceable, the curries were okay and the drunken noodles were one of my favorite entrees.  Admittedly, usually the draw was decor and mood, rather than food.  It has a combination of low prices and trendy digs that naturally appeal to its desired demographic.   Which brings me to my next point -- Sea/Williamsburg definitely does not want anyone with kids.  We went to Sea last night early in the evening with our toddler and was told that they did not have any high chairs or booster seats...in the entire restaurant.  We left and went to Chai for a far superior meal with pleasant servers, less of crowd and beautiful, low-lit decor. Now that Sea Brooklyn is a bridge and tunnel destination, they can discriminate against people who actually live in the neighborhood, love Thai food and happen to have a little kid or two. Thankfully, there are 15 other Thai restaurants in the area that we frequent -- I recommend Erb for great food/fast delivery or Chai for atmosphere/delicious food (esp. their duck spring rolls and curries).   (Re: alternatives to the E.

A little too mushy on the inside and a little too much clove. My friends food never came out. So we had to find a waitress to let her know. (She never came back to the table).

This place in no way shape or form is worthy of a $50.00 cover. As a matter of fact they are not set up to be charging a cover. I was upstairs and saw it and it's couchs for hookah with a dj that's it. You can do all of that downstairs. It isn't worthy of ANY COVER.

I stayed there during the holidays last year and was super happy with my hotel choice. The front of the hotel was covered in xmas lights, so it had a very festive feel -- a nice touch in NYC winter. Yes, there isn't a great deal of excitement next door to the hotel, but seriously, *everything* is within walking distance in NYC. Perhaps being a NYer skews my perspective, but walking 4-6 NYC blocks to find something that meets your needs is nothing (unless you're used to driving from place to place in a much more sprawled environment)...put on your shoes and WALK people! NYC's a pedestrian city, so you're expected to do at least some foot traveling! Personally, I appreciated the fact that the hotel was *not* in Times Square (like most of the larger chains) and away from the Penn Station area. The location was a bonus for me. Like most people have said, the service was relatively high-touch, but my favorite part of the hotel was the room itself. The standard RG room was quite a bit larger than some other ""higher-end"" hotels I've been to in NYC. And by NYC standards, I'd say the RG's rooms are on the larger end of the spectrum. Also, the room was updated well, with a frosted glass bathroom door to a 45"" plasma TV in front of the super comfy and high-thread-count-covered bed.",253,1,,,

Now let's get this straight, I love spicy foods but after the first wing I knew this wings were not a joke on the spiciness. Although they were really spicy the sweetness did come out and just nicely coaxed your taste buds. My honey wings were amazing, still craving more.

There is a nice pre-boarding bar to catch a drink while you wait and the restrooms were clean. There were six of us on board following my marriage ceremony at City Hall and we went up to the third deck and were able to secure seats in the shade near the bar. That was nice. The food is so-so. I found it odd that a steamed lobster would be served so hot. Normally a steamed lobster is steamed and kept at room temp so you can crack it without it burning your hand. But the actual lobster itself was good. I didn't want the potato or the asparagus that came with the lobster, a steamed lobster should be, IMO, simple. If you want a side that should be extra...point was, I wanted to eat two of those suckers and with the sides that wasn't practical. It would be wasting food (not that I ate the sides anyways). Friends got the lobster taco's and seemed to be satisfied, but another got the lobster roll and felt it was a C. Not enough lobster, not quality lobster and the roll was toasted and so bready, you couldn't taste what you were eating. The employees all seemed as if working was the LAST thing they wanted. Not that I was expecting a red carpet, but we had clearly just gotten married and even a GLASS of comp'ed champagne would have been nice, but no, they kept charging me $11 bucks. Even a smile would have been nice. Bottom line is this is fun. It might be better for the under 29 crowd as they sometimes care less about quality and more about scene and fun. I doubt I would do this again unless it was with my much younger friends and I had the time. There are too many other quality lobster places in the city to spend the time on this.",337,0,,,

Staff was very friendly and attentive. We had pasta fagioli and caesar salad to start. Pasta fagioli was one of the best I've ever had, great taste and broth. Salad was good but hard to compete with the soup. For our main courses, we had veal parmigiana (sliced thin and perfectly breaded) and steak frites. The steak was cooked perfectly and the salsa verde was a great accompaniment. Coffee and sorbet finished our delicious meal. The only reason we gave it 4 stars? On a very warm NYC day, the restaurant didn't seem much cooler inside. It was warm inside the restaurant and this was the only detraction to our experience as neither of us wanted to have more than one glass of wine so as not to make it any warmer for us.

Sandwiches come in one size only but honestly it's all you need for a perfect sized lunch. Best yet prices are $5.50 to $5.80 a sandwich which I think is a great price. Sure for $5 you can get certain footlongs at Subway, but these guys have a better sandwich - can't compare. They don't skimp on the meat, the toppings are great (love it with hot giardiniera which is easy to find in Chicago, but not in NYC). Their classic is the Wreck which I remember being roast beef, turkey and salami. The others are great too. Throw in a bag a chips and a soda and you have lunch in midtown Manhattan for under $10. Nice! Ample seating, both upstairs and downstairs.

The dumplings (boiled or fried) are really good.  The dough's not too thick and a good size.  The boiled ones are good, and the fried ones are crispy without being greasy.  The dumplings are $1 an order or if you're bling bling, you can get the $4 ones. The pancakes are really good!  The toasted sesame on them with meat and veggies inside are so tasty and really hits the spot.  At $2 or under a pop, they're very satisfying without being greasy. The noodles are ok.  They're around $3.50 a pop and they definitely get you full, but not too exciting. The best deal's their frozen dumplings!  $9 for a bag of 50 dumplings is an awesome deal to take home and eat whenever. Service: you just walk in, grab a tri-fold menu (pretty clear layout in English/Chinese with almost everything less than $5), and order with the lady at the end of the counter.  It can get really busy, so the wait may be a little while, but it's definitely worth it.  They call your number (some with strong Chinese accents) and you pick it up.  You bus your own table. Atmosphere: recently remodeled, giving it a spacious dark wood / stainless steel restaurant feel.  The seats and small tables are easily moveable to accommodate small to large groups easily.  It's pretty clean, and you can see the busy kitchen.  You know everything is clean because they're cooking everything in front of you.  It's populated by a mix of LES folks, Asian folks, and others.  Definitely a busy place that a lot of people come in and out of quickly, but a well kept restaurant. Location: definitely a place to stop by when in LES, especially when it's late and you're hungry.  It's a few blocks away from 3 subway stops, so it's accessible.",360,0,,,

Hou Yi claimed it was an hour wait by the time I arrived at 5:50pm on a Tuesday (which I normally would have begrudgingly accepted but we had tickets for an 8pm event), while Favor Taste told us we had to wait an hour and a half despite the fact that we made reservations earlier that day. We even tried calling Mr Hotpot but they were booked until 10pm (on a Wednesday...). But on our way down to Favor Taste we passed this place and I said to my friend ""Look, they do hot pot and I can tell they have seats available. If we get locked out -again- lets just go there.""   And so, after Favor Taste gave us the middle finger we walked back to Hangout 58, asked for a table and they said ""sure thing, give us 5 minutes"" 2. FRIENDLY PEOPLE Not only did Hangout 58 tell us it was a completely reasonable 5 minute wait to be seated, they lead us over to some chairs and then handed us FREE COCA COLA IN A CUP WITH ICE. AND WERE LIKE ""HERE, PLEASE ENJOY THIS"" AND I WAS LIKE ""THANK YOU."" So for everybody who wrote 'bad service' like are you *&%#@ing kidding me, this is what royalty must feel like. This restaurant coulda been total crap and I woulda been like ""YEAH BUT THE FREE COKE THO"" like I'm sorry but that's some goddamn great service. 3. GOOD FOOD Except that the food at Hangout 58 is -NOT- total crap, it is in fact GOOD. It is fresh and it is tasty and it is FINE. In fact, I'd go as far as to say is exactly the same as all of these other hot pot places that Yelp seems to love so much more but are in fact nothing special because it's goddamn hot pot not a freaking michelin star restaurant dining experience that requires making reservations several weeks in advance. 4. GREAT PRICES All you can eat hot pot for two hours for TWENTY DOLLARS YOU @#$%^&*( ARE OYU KIDDING ME Every other goddamn hot pot place is like $30 + your first born for food you're goddamn cooking yourself. Hangout 58 is COMPLETELY FAIRLY PRICED. Also, for people bitching about how they didn't realize ordering off the special menu cost more money, welcome to the planet earth CHRIST 5. EASY ATMOSPHERE, GOOD SERVICE No complaints about service at all. NO COMPLAINTS.  It's a large restaurant and there's people running around constantly, if you want somebody's attention then go get it. If you're just gonna sit around without making eye contact and expect everybody to read your mind you have problems. So all in all, five stars, screw you internet and your popular BS hot pot places. Yeah sure I'm a white devil and maybe I don't know all of the ins and outs of the ~*~**perfect hot pot**~*~ that I could be having, but I'm putting my foot down on the needless waiting and reckless money spending that the New York dining experience is becoming. Get out of your comfort zone Yelpers and check out some of these ignored and unfairly maligned gems. Just because people on the internet all flock around three hot pot places doesn't mean those place are actually all that special...",616,1,,,

Then I went back on Saturday, ordered mostly the same things (different dining partner), and it was inedible and terrible. On a good day: The sampler they've been doing on the small plates is great, you get a taste of everything, I don't like egg or ricotta, but I loved the scotch quail egg. The cold chilled texture of the foie gras is something I love that WD-50 does and I'm so glad they brought it over. The hamachi was so so, I've had better in the neighborhood. The scallops were amazing, perfectly done sides, and the pasta is a solid get. On a bad day: The foie gras tasted like cat food and was barely holding shape. The scotch quail egg was completely inedible. The scallops were sandy and dry, the side veggies tasted steamed. They're just too inconsistent to give love. Also, had the same waitress both times, the first time she came off as aloof, realized the second time it was because she was inexperienced and didn't know what basic things mean (like the silverware signal that we're done eating that course). Everyone was nice, the place is adorable, the trendy wood ceiling is definitely not meant as a sound dampener, crazy loud. Just a note, the really good night I went was early on a Thursday, not a crush. Saturday night was a crush. So maybe go when they're not so busy and it'll be a good meal.

The place itself is tiny, with no more space to accommodate more than 10 or so customers. The main business here is obviously take out. Like i do at all sushi places I'll go for a couple of basic rolls, usually the Philly roll and spicy Tuna. The fish is fresh and delicious, and the rolls are well assembled (they won't fall apart on you). If you order a few rolls, you will be treated with miso soup, which I find to be delightful. A few weeds of sea here and there in combination with egg yolk pair up excellently. The real treat, however, are the specialty rolls. Personally, i am so enticed by the 52nd roll that i have yet to try any other specialty rolls, but hopefully that is telling of how much effort goes into the rolls. Shrimp tempura combined with spicy mayo, crab meat (not sure if authentic or imitation) and other things goes amazingly. 52nd roll is a must try for anyone who tries sushi here.

We've now been at Fragole twice and each time has been pleasant. It's rustic Italian fare and service is friendly. I have not smelled the offensive odor of cleaning products that others have commented on but the music is sort of odd for the spot. We're not in Ibiza, we're in Carroll Gardens? I had the squid ink spaghetti with crab and spicy tomato sauce. Pasta was way overcooked, sadly, and it's even more disappointing since we were there early and it wasn't busy. Also, a bit more saucy than I like. The man had the same problems with his orechiette with sausage. Overcooked and saucy. Perhaps just an off night in the kitchen?

If you want something in addition to pizza, I highly recommend the lasagna and Arugula salad.  The lasagna is authentic with a great tomato sauce and the arugula salad is bitter but sweet with sundried tomatoes and peppers.  When you finish your meal and are stuffed beyond belief, order the Nutella cake.  It is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had - tastes like a jar of nutella condensed into a slide of fudge.   It's always fun to eat outside when the weather is nice but it gets crowded very quickly after 5 pm.  The inside is quite small, unless you get a high top table in the front or back you are likely to be crammed close to a stranger (just hope they don't sneeze on your pie).  The lights are dimmed low and the bar is full, it's a great after work spot in the FiDi.",353,0,,,

The steak was nicely seasoned and tender, the sides were good as well but overall my date and I agreed that the meal was just... meh. This is officially not my favorite NYC steakhouse.... but I wouldn't turn down a meal here either.",58,0,,,

But I was pleasantly surprised on just how good the burgers are! I'm from South Jersey, and frequent NYC and Philly often. I've been to all the major burger spots: FiveGuys, SmashBurger, ShakeShack, Wayback Burger, Bobby's Burger Palace. I have to say, BRGR has amazing burgers. I had a the fresh morning beef burger. Salty, cheesy, and delicious. It did take awhile for the burger to come out, but the service wasn't awful. I highly reccommend this burger joint, and plan on visiting again!",99,1,,,

And after talking to the manager he did apologize and gave us a discount off our bill.,52,0,,,

It took my friends and me about 1-1.5 hours just to get seated. We drank beer standing up till then. Location and large beer selection may be the main reason we continue to go to this place.<br>I&#39;ve never ordered food here, but they seemed like any other bar food. I tried were good-allagash white, tired hands, saison hands (too sour for me @.@), and decadent ale strawberry IPA- all pretty decent.",82,0,,,

It was really hot and spicy, even more than I had imagined but it was absolutely delicious! We ordered the Som Tum Thai Salad (Thai papaya salad with dried shrimp and peanuts) for starters and I had a shrimp entree for my meal. I went with a date this time but the place is causal enough that I could see myself going there with a large group and enjoying it.",84,0,,,

The only reason I chose this place was because Carmines and Tony&#39;s Di Napoli we&#39;re booked up and this place came up as &#34;family style&#34;, which it actually isn&#39;t. Upon arriving the Hostess says &#34;oh you were 5, not you&#39;re 6?&#34; I said, &#34;no, it was always 6&#34;. He turns to the waitress and says &#34;add another chair to the table&#34;. She brings us over and it is a booth that would fit 3-4 people tops. They squeezed 6 adults at this table. My Dad isn&#39;t a small guy, my boyfriend is 6&#39;2, I&#39;m 5&#39;7, so we did not fit even remotely well at this table. My sister asks if we could be moved since they made the mistake and we wouldn&#39;t even be able to fit our food on the table for all of us. The waitress says &#34;we can put you at an actual 6 top, but you have to be done in an hour and a half because we have other reservations.&#34; They made the mistake of putting us down for 5 people and they want us to rush our dinner now!? So we move to that table. The waitress who took our drink order took 40 mins to bring them over and forgot 1. We waited another 10 mins for that last drink and my Dad had to go over to her standing around twirling her hair and asked if we could get that last drink, ridiculous! Then my boyfriend asks if we could get bread or something?! &#34;Oh sorry the bus boy should have brought it over&#34;. Almost an hour to get drinks and bread and they wanted us to rush our meal?! And it&#39;s expensive for small portions! $30 for a small plate of 5 raviolis?! $30 for a small cast iron pan of lasagna!? Bill came to $600 and it was 100% not worth that. The service was beyond horrible and the food portions would only fill up a child. I won&#39;t be back and I won&#39;t be recommending this place to anyone.",363,0,,,

This is our first time eating from this place and will be our last. I&#39;m all for supporting small businesses especially during these weird times. We ordered a regular plain pie, nothing crazy and I hate to say this but, it was probably one of the worst pizza I&#39;ve had in a while. Dollar pizza and Chucky Cheese pizza is better than this place.",78,0,,,

Service was fine, but honestly, as a life-time veggie, I wasn't that impressed by the food. The appetizers are where this place is at - fried shrimp, crab, spring rolls, dumplings, etc... it was definitely interesting, and quite unique as they're trying to mock the tastes of chicken, pork, shrimp, etc... but honestly, as a vegetarian, I don't think I want those tastes in my mouth. I get that this place attracts those who are vegetarian for moral reasons, but still enjoy the taste. If that's you, then this is your place!",106,0,,,

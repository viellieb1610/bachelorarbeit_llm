0,1893220,2009-12-05,Enchorde,地心冒險 (2008),5.0,"Recap: Unsuccessful and mainly disrespected geologist Trevor Anderson is obsessed with the idea that his disappeared brother put forth. That the tectonics works in such a way that another world might exist beneath ours, just like the story Jules Verne wrote. He is so obsessed he almost forgets that he is to take care of his nephew Josh a few days, so when the two of them find an anomaly on Iceland, he got to bring Josh along. He enlists young mountain guide Hannah, but on the expedition, they become trapped in a cave. It leads further and further down and soon they find themselves on the most unbelievable adventure.Comments: Yes, it is an adventure without any comparison, but two things should be known about this movie. First off, it is a family movie. Yes, it is adventurous, but not in any really suspenseful way. More in the goofy, funny way. You should know this before you watch, because otherwise it might become annoying.Second off, it was released in a 3D-version, and the script and direction is clearly adapted to it. It is all too evident, even if you don't get the 3D-version. Some stretches of the film is far too much alike a theme park ride to be really good. But I bet it is spectacular in 3D. Apparently the original writer and director left the production in fear of the movie focusing on effects more than story. His fears proved to be well founded as the story unfortunately takes the back seat to effects far too often. As a grown-up it almost gets boring sometimes, and I guess a few kids might think so too.Surprisingly much of the CGI is of pretty poor quality. Some animals and environment is feeling too much like plastic toys, and the characters are too evidently acting before a blue screen. Sure, I know they must be, but when it looks like they were cut in like in a movies from the forties, it's bad.I didn't much appreciate the acting either, with one exception. Mostly this is due to the characters. Trevor is too goofy and clumsy, and too responsible for the comic effect. Josh suffers from movie-kid syndrome annoyingly putting himself in trouble too much. Only Anita Briem, an authentic Icelandic, as Hannah is a competent character and acts convincingly. I sincerely hopes she get better roles in the future, and returns for the planned sequel.I had hoped for more, even without any high expectations. Maybe next time they could focus more on doing the basics, like a decent story, before they concentrate on the special effects.5/10",435,0,,0,"No reference.

This film is a tad bit better than the previous two films due mostly to having a Western location, which adds a different touch to the typical murder mystery. Conway is more energized here and delivers a fine performance and even the supporting players are a step up from previous films with Cliff Clark stealing the show as the dimwitted but tough trying Detective.

Right.

Life is what happens while you're making plans and sometimes life throws a curve or two-and sometimes, life throws the baseball bat at your head. Such is the case here, in a short which starts with a morning straight out of Norman Rockwell that veers into Bosch all too quickly for the primary characters. Memorable, with images that will stick around for quite a while. I'll never see eggs, bacon or produce quite the same way again.

It actually turned out to be a good movie! I like the suspense and the horror mix along with it. I like how the story goes and the music was really cool and adds a whole lot to the composition of the movie. The actors were on top of their game and was great throughout the whole movie. The suspense kept my blood running really fast and my heart beat like crazy! The plot was amazingly unexpected. The dirty bad cops and their schemes made their investigation so believable and the way they take advantage of their job is mind-blowing. Also, the couples' house was really beautiful! The main characters were amazing in their role and they played it really well. And the antagonist was really great too! He also played the role really well. The setting was perfect for the movie.

7,394462,2002-02-19,kinglevy,Jules and Jim (1962),6.0,"I'll warn you ahead of time, this is a bit of a spoiler.

Jules et Jim is one of the best examples of a New Wave love story. New Wave embodies the concept of a director working as an author would towards a great novel, the film is his work. Director Francois Truffaut's variety of great camera effects and subtle symbolism help to improve an otherwise bland screenplay.

The film about love and what it can do to friendships and personalities. It's a tale of three lovers set in France around World War I. Jules and Jim are best friends, Jim a Frenchman and Jules an Austrian. The pair does everything together, until they are separated by a woman named Catherine. Jules marries Catherine and buy a cottage in the country. While Jim lives his life in Paris, Jules and Catherine have a daughter and begin to raise her. The movie grows repetitive near the end, as Catherine betrays nearly every many she is with as her `love' jumps from person to person.

Following the concept of New Wave filmmaking, Truffaut truly is the auteur of the film. The screenplay, based on a novel by Henri Pierre Roché, is a basic French love story. Primarily based upon dialogue rather than actions, the story moves very slowly at times and very quickly at others. These sudden changes of pace done come without warning. There is an early scene with a Jim, Therese and Therese's steam engine trick, hinting that Jim may be spending quite a chunk of time riding on a train. Then there is the squeaky rocking chair in the cottage, representing the constant movement of Catherine and her desires. Perhaps the most memorable scene in the movie is Catherine's daring leap into a river. The scene is beautiful in terms of character development, explaining her seemingly crazy personality.

However, Truffaut's techniques are not without flaws. For example, the fate of Catherine and Jules's daughter Sabine is never explained. Sabine is a great refuge for Jim for a portion of the film, but scenes later she disappears. Near the end of the film when Catherine threatens to kill Jim, she gets a gun out of thin air. There are no gun shops around, no foreshadowing whatsoever. Perhaps this is simply Truffaut's idea of a surprise ending, but it really seems out of place from the rest of the film.

The film is quite a bit longer than it needed to be. Aside from the very end of the movie, the last hour or so grew extremely repetitive. Catherine's toying with her variety of lovers is way too extensive, almost pointless.; the men get hurt, then just keep coming back for more. This seems odd, considering earlier in the movie Catherine was described as a true woman rather than a perfect woman.

New Wave filmmaking is defined in Jules et Jim. It's described by most as poetic, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good. The creative direction makes the movie interesting at times, however the average screenplay makes it quite a boring two hours.",513,0,,0,"No reference.

He wants something, but even HE doesn't seem sure what – his money his wife kept, and brought to her new marriage? Revenge on her for forgetting him? To win her back? Meanwhile, her own lawyer also takes on Chabert's side of the case, trying to broker a compromise, before word leaks out and all involved are ruined in scandal. (Fabrice Luchini is great as the lawyer who's motives are always a little mysterious). An interesting, subtle study of what's really of value in life. My only complaint is that some of the Machiavellian machinations are a little obviously played by both Ardant's character and her greedy, wormy new husband, who values a peerage over marriage, love or family. Somehow that artifice makes the film a bit less emotionally powerful than it might be. But I'd certainly see it again.",163,0,,0,"No reference.

It doesn't take much time to figure out that Timothy Treadwell was an unstable personality. There was even a personal crisis mentioned, after which he found a purpose in life in living among bears. Nevertheless, i felt a heartache when watching him talking to them or explaining to the schoolchildren how meek they actually are.We may also assume that he simply had a different outlook on life. But even then you must grow up in Disneyland in order to believe that grizzly bears are man's friends.

Mangal Pandey - who? In short its just an instance of kartoos & its attached melodrama coupled with songs & mangal pandey fighting for it. The rising almost looks like a short story/chapter from a history book than an epic. One would expect more from Amir & a 4 yr production work (not to mention 1 yr post production). Songs were unnecessary & the dialogues were uninspirational too. (imagine mangal pandey shouting all to 'raise' for a war by saying ""chalo chalo"" )But yeah, Amir did an honest job & so did Toby but then history should have more drama & war & bloody gore to show an impact as powerful as it should have been.

I figured ""King Arthur"" would be fresh, interesting and exciting. And it was ... almost.The director and screenwriter hedged their bets a little. Although the main character's real name is Lucius Artorius Castus (played by Clive Owen), he is referred to as Arthur. Guinevere and Lancelot are along for the ride, of course. Gawain and Galahad, too. Even the Round Table is thrown in for good measure. The problem is, only Arthur seems to have any real personality, any conflict or angst. Everybody else just gets swept up and along in his drama.And it's not even a personal, intimate drama. Gone is the tense love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot. What we get in its place is drama of a far more cerebral kind -- more philosophical than emotional. What motivates Arthur and his ""knights""? Longing for a home they have not seen for 15 years ... loyalty to an empire that no longer exists ... and, of all things, belief in the teachings of a heretic (Pelagius). The Rome Arthur fights is not that of the Caesars, but of the Church.I might have been more interested if the film had delved more deeply into the Pelagian heresy, but it only scratches the surface.

The film had potential to be at least mediocre, but it just didn't work. The film was based around a weak, predictable plot that was filled with glaring plot-holes, and the characters and relationships were too underdeveloped to even make the film a character-driven story. Characters wander in and out of the plot without ever gathering much sympathy or hatred from audiences, and eventually it becomes difficult to care what happens to any of them. Even their dialogue is pitiful: swearing is fine in movies, but this film goes beyond overkill with its ridiculous amount of profanity, even to the point where it becomes distracting. Rather than encouraging viewers to listen for meaning in the characters' words, this film's dialogue quickly becomes a game of seeing just how many variations of the ""F word"" can be jammed into a single sentence. Just in case the film itself isn't horrible enough, the musical score is also horrendous. It has some sort of bizarre attempt at a musical motive, but it is annoyingly repetitive and changes little from scene to scene.

One of the shots in the second scene is a bit confusing as to location, as you can see Ratner's across the street and Ratner's was, I believe, located further downtown, but the famous Second Avenue Deli was in that location for years and it's possible it once was known as Ratner's. St. Mark's church figures prominently in these scenes as well.This opening sequence gives pause to those who like to think of the 1950s as a less violent time than our own.Although none of the businesses shown on this episode are still there, the buildings mercifully haven't changed very much at all.

Nair either does not understand the book on which the film was based or has no respect for the author, Thackeray. A 750 page book is condensed into a 137 minutes film, and thus a major plot point occurs about every two minutes. Reese Witherspoon's Becky Sharp is a woefully unrealized character, portraying about as much depth as one would encounter in a high school play. In trying to make Sharp sympathetic, the entire point of the book is lost ( the self-serving vanity of all characters from all walks of life, including Becky Sharp). The attempts by Nair to re-interpret Thackeray from a postcolonial viewpoint are laughably half-baked, including a poorly executed pseudo Bollywood dance sequence which occurs nearly two hours into the film and has no relation to anything else that comes before. An Indian historian I talked to found Nair's view of India quite orientalist, as the director exoticizes the culture she's supposed to be championing.On the positive side there are many fine character actors on display, who for the most part are not given anything interesting to do.

            I first heard about this film when it sprung out of nowhere into Jonathon Ross's 'Best Film of the Year' event at number 5. He used the words 'low-budget', and only one scene was shown, and a very badly chosen one at that. (The cafeteria scene with the brilliant Carrie-Ann-Moss) It didn't catch my attention much for these two reasons, hence it was bad marketing.            I then forgot almost instantly about it, until it then, about 6 months later it popped into the IMDB at number 12. (No mean feat when you look what it's up against!) I then saw a better trailer for it, where it showed parts of the first 'reverse scene', where the gun flies backwards into Guy Pearce's hand, and instantly wanted to see it.            I had heard that the film had gotten a limited release, and being out here in Germany, with an equally limited variety of new films, I thought I wouldn't see it for ages. The next day I noticed that my local rental store was closing down, and at my lunch break, went over there to see what was selling. Hiding in a corner towards the back, was Memento. For 20 Deutsche Mark's ! (6 pounds, 10 dollars) Of course I rushed home to grab some money, and came late back to work, but hey, once you've seen the film, and understand my position, it was worth coming late for.
            I watched it once, and was impressed with its originality, and at how clever the middle scenes were, but was somewhat dazed about the end. Only now, after a second viewing, can I say that I understood it all. I know who was good and bad, and who strayed into both categories. Only real brainboxes with IQ's higher than the length of this film would understand it all the first time. Many people will claim to have understood it as they casually walk out of the cinema, but 80% of them will be lying.             I think the point I am trying to get at, is that this is a 'MUST see twice within a month film', for the ultimate viewing pleasure.             Every scene begins a mystery, but then once it has backtracked to familiar ground there is a very strange feeling of satisfaction.
            This certainly deserves to be at number one of any top 10 list, see it now, and if you already have, you probably haven't understood it, so see it again.AND THIS ISN'T FOR ANYBODY WITH SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS THEMSELVES !",426,1,bezieht sich nicht auf bewertungen,1,"Reference to other reviews.

36,1955225,2010-04-19,eucalyptus9,The Lovely Bones (2009),9.0,"I'd heard the acclaim for the novel ""The Lovely Bones"" so got a hold of the book and found the first few chapters interesting and original. Before long, though, it descended into a tedious, boring narrative that eventually had me turning to the end of the book, to find one of the lamest endings to a story I'd encountered.Somehow, out of this tedium Peter Jackson has fashioned a fascinating and beautiful film. The beauty seems to come from his own visionary qualities - many of the scenes of the after life hark back to the imaginative settings he created for his early feature ""Heavenly Creatures'. He's removed some of the novel's subplots - the changing dynamics of the Salmon family with their community, and the affair between Len and Abigail, although the latter gets the merest hint, when Jack is thanking Len for his friendship, and adds, meaningfully ""And thanks for being such a good friend to Abigail."" Subtle. The film had a PG-13 rating in the US and so the rape of Susie is glossed over, but the way that Jackson conveys the horror of her murder, without melodrama and explicitness, is remarkably well done.The cast are universally good. Mark Wahlberg, who was the best thing about ""The Departed"", seems to have since embarked upon a series of shonky performances in atrociously bad films, but in this, he is again excellent. Susan Sarandon has an hilariously funny scene, and Saoirse Ronan is brilliant. She's not a classic screen beauty, but when her erstwhile boyfriend Ray says to her ""You are beautiful, Susie Salmon"", you can't help but agree. I guess that Stanloy Tucci gets the major kudos. He's unrecognisable at first, and his sinister predator is as much a landmark villain as Anthony Hopkins made of Hannibal Lecter.Like Mel Gibson, Jackson's hand as director is evident in all his films. His major flaw is a tendency to go on too damn long - The Return of the King, King Kong - and I thought this movie was heading in the same direction, but he's restrained himself here. Jackson has created a good body of work - Meet The Feebles is always worth another look - but I think that this is his finest film. 9/10",376,0,,0,"No reference.

They pass the time casually, not much happens. End of first half. They take some kind of drug (I assume to be acid,) they share the surreal nightmare trip. Something bad happens, one of them will not be going home, ever, they react to it in varying ways.I couldn't help but enjoy the movie, they looked like they enjoyed themselves making it and that sense of fun comes across when watching. The dialogue is so real as we are treated to awkward conversations between people who have not much in common except shared college experiences and wonderfully natural lines such as ""oh my god, I bought wigs,"" ""fantastic, tell me more,"" ""they're blonde"" which made me giggle at the audacity of the film maker. The uncomfortable silences between the girls are even more realistic and true, it is these gaps in dialogue that accentuate what the movie is; a fun yet uncomfortable film about people and the way they relate to each other.The cinematography from Daryl Pitman is superb, not just for a low budget film but for a film full stop, he uses vivid colours, a locked camera and a clean crisp use of light to highlight the overall feel of fresh playfulness and a tension that's slow to build to barely a simmer.The music and sound design has gotten a lot of play, and rightly so, it is sufficiently hip when required and noticeably helps add to the sense of impending dread after one of the girls remarks that ""things are only going to get worse."" Whilst the idea of four lesbian/bi-sexual girls drinking and having fun would ordinarily play in to male fantasies without even trying, I left Vacation! massively impressed with Zach Clark's direction and his restraint. The film studies concept of the camera gaze as male is largely thrown out of the window here as at no point did I get the sense that any of the proceedings were being eroticised, or the characters shown in an overtly sexual manner. Even the brief nudity and sexual behaviour is filmed so matter of factly that claims of misogyny would be flimsy at best.Overall this is no Gregg Arraki, there's less plot, but it is a fun and impressive piece of low budget independent non-genre film making worth watching. blahblahblahgay.blogspot",408,0,,0,"No reference.

46,2750936,2014-10-28,robert-temple-1,An Angel for May (2002 TV Movie),9.0,"This is a very fine British family film. Because it is British rather than American, it is not stuffed full of artificial and mawkish sentimentality, but is more effective for being 'straight up'. The central role is played by an excellent child actor named Matthew Beard (born 1989), who since then has appeared in many films and TV series, most recently playing Guy Bellingfield in the rather notorious recent film THE RIOT CLUB (2014), which parodies the Bullingdon Club at Oxford. The young girl who plays opposite Beard is played by Charlotte Wakefield (born 1990), who is also excellent. Since then she has appeared in four TV series. Angeline Ball does an excellent job of playing the highly nervy and objectionable mother of Beard and does some really good hysterical scenes. (Let's hope she does not take her work home with her.) Sturdy Tom Wilkinson is there, like an English oak, supporting the whole effort with his unflappable demeanour as a farmer who is the adoptive father of the girl. Anna Massey plays 'Rosie' and gives a marvellous professional polish to the proceedings, as she did to everything. Of all the actresses I have known, she was certainly one of the nicest and most intelligent. She was married to a delightful, gentle scientist named Uri Andres (who once astounded me by handing me a chunk of kimberlite containing diamonds), having earlier somehow survived marriage to Jeremy Brett, which was evidently not easy. (She also had sadly unsatisfactory relationships with her father and her brother, the actors Raymond Massey and Daniel Massey, so you could say she had a rough time with the male gender for much of her life.) She was a truly fascinating woman. The well-known character actress Dora Bryan has a bit part in this film, and it is a shame we see so little of her. Willard Carroll has done a very good job of directing this film. The story is a 'slip through time' one, where the little boy of today goes back to the days of World War Two and then returns much wiser. It is quite an adventure, and children will love it.

I could have happily spent 90 minutes learning about the extraordinary Grand Central Tiffany clock, but instead I got wasted minutes of flashy montages of starlets and social x-rays, and a weirdly long tangent into the Capote book / Edward's film Breakfast at Tiffany's that included an even weirder examination of the Deep Blue Somethings song of the same name.
The film is artfully produced to be sure, but it's a fabulous 90 minute commercial that does nothing much to make us any wiser about how the store, its visionaries and incredible craftsman created an American commercial and artistic icon. The soundtrack is over-excited and distracting and the parade of people whose lives were touched ever-so-vaguely by the brand is gratuitous.
If you're interested in a deep dive into the back story of an incredible brand, have a look for Patrick Mark's Faberge: A Life Of It's Own instead.",196,0,,0,No reference.

51,1578399,2008-01-26,HelloTexas11,Patton (1970),10.0,"Patton' is pretty much a one-man show. George C. Scott's Oscar-winning portrayal dominates the film and overshadows all the other characters, much as Patton dominated those under his command in real life. There is no real attempt to create another strong character in the movie; Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is mainly used to react to Patton and the British General Montgomery is seen as a caricature, a stereotypical stuffy Brit who contrasts with Patton's earthy and impulsive nature. Scott truly becomes Patton in this film; it's difficult now to think of one without the other. The characterization and the film have many layers. On the one hand, 'Patton' is a straightforward war flick, with big, well-staged battle sequences. But it is also a brooding psychological study of a complicated individual, one who's near-madness goes hand in hand with his cunning and courage. Patton comes across as, among many things, an outsider in his own chosen field of endeavor. The other officers, including the generals who are his superiors, consider him something of a brilliant kook, to be used when needed and shunted aside when he isn't, or when he embarrasses them. Eisenhower, who is never seen or heard in the film, and his group of generals are businesslike, no-nonsense types who share none of Patton's flamboyance or showmanship. To them, the war is an ugly business to be concluded as quickly and painlessly as possible. For Patton, it is a holy, glorious crusade that defines him and his reason for being. Some critics claimed the movie was both pro-war and anti-war. I have to agree with Roger Ebert, it's no such thing; it's about as pro-war as you can get. But since its setting is World War II, that is not a difficult or far-fetched notion to accept. Even in this confused day and age where we agonize over whether conflicts are worth getting involved in, most people agree that the U.S. was on the right side in the second world war and that vanquishing Hitler and the Nazis was the right thing to do. Patton embodies that ideal and so we naturally root for him even if some of his actions and statements go against what we would do. George C. Scott so inhabits the character of Patton that it almost becomes irrelevant whether the portrayal is one-hundred per cent accurate. As war historians have pointed out, liberties are taken both with dialogue and plot points; there was no 'race' for Messina between Montgomery and Patton, there were actually two soldiers who were slapped, etc. But these easily fall into the realm of cinematic license and do nothing to detract from the essential reality Scott brings to his characterization. And it certainly says something about General Patton that the famous speech he gave in 1944 had to be toned down for a movie that was released in 1970!",479,0,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Yes, it left a lot to be desired - a better ending for one - but it was interesting, somewhat thought provoking and the characters were very entertaining.  I loved Jennifer Tilly's character and her various ""tantrum"" scenes.  Daryl Hannah's character was pathetic and annoying, but at least she was consistent in the way that she created the character.  What I was most disappointed in  is that actresses are constantly complaining about having to play girlfriends, bimbos and other stereotypes, yet when they have an opportunity to create a character in an workshop/ensemble piece they decide on strippers.  Seems like a bit of a cop-out to me ""at least if the movie is no good, they'll watch for the stripping."" And in disagreement with another post, I was surprised at how naked the actresses actually got - there were a lot of very flattering shots and lots of unflattering ones as well, including lots of close-ups.

54,4512477,2019-11-08,skunkworksalpha,Midway (2019),10.0,"Midway was an excellent movie that depicts the events leading up to the battle of Midway and the battle itself.
It is fairly quick paced with enough historical background character introductions to leave the viewer invested, even if we already know the outcome. The family and buddy scenes are not lengthy, and add just the right amount of the human element.
The movie covers the events from before Pearl Harbor, the attack on pearl Harbor, the US raid on the Marianas islands, Doolittle's raid, the battle of Coral Sea, the battle of Midway and the intelligence, strategy, of both the US and IJN navies. Though none of the events is overly detailed it is enough for the average historian to see all the ""easter eggs"" and the non-historian left informed and intrested.
While the movie covers a lot of historical ground it doesn't get overly detailed on each event, even the Midway battle itself. What it does do is provides the viewer the overall tension, concerns and apprehensions of the mood of he US durring this time in history.
Midway does leave out certain historical events. It didn't cover the PBYs search, the B-17 raids on the IJN carriers, it didn't include Jimmy Thatch, or the two attacks on the Yorktown in detail.
But, and I must stress this fact, what it did cover was accurate (with the exception of the US torpedo planes carrying bombs on wing hard mounts).
For the first time in a movie it covers the air raids on the IJN carriers from Midway itself, including thr B-26 Marauders, but not the TBF avengers. It included the Nautilus Gato class firing on the IJN taskforce and the reason the Japanese left behind the destroyer which was later followed by the US SBDs that led them to the IJN carries.
The CGI was adequate for visual effects, and the detail of the Yorktown class carriers and even the IJN carriers was incredibly accurate.
Midway focuses on several key individuals to be the protagonist rather than a PBS style docudrama.
Midway also pays attention to detail about the age of the sailors, the types of aircraft, and weaponry aboard ships.
Midway does feel like it needs the director's cut and would do better as a three hour movie as it felt a little rushed at times.

The script and direction are coherent, and the viewer can certainly identify with the main character as another poor schmoe who's been run over by life, with no way out. In a way, it elicits a positive reaction because Rulo, the fiftyish and overweight protagonist, never seems to lose spirit as he suffers one telling blow after another.As with many other recent films coming out of post-fascist South America, it is moreover revealing of the intense personal struggles these basically European people have faced as time continues to run against them in terms of their general redundancy within the context of a world economy.In a word, sad.

61,4090558,2019-03-30,MidnightSerpent,Tengen toppa gurren lagann (2007–2008),10.0,"You know that feeling of total shock and awe that you get after finishing a really good show or movie? Where you just sit there staring at the screen, unable to process the sheer epicness of what you just saw? Imagine that feeling, but ten times stronger, and you might get a taste of what I felt while watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Every time I finish that final episode, I get this euphoric feeling that lasts for several hours on end, often keeping me up the entire night on pure adrenaline. There isn't a single day that goes by where I don't have flashbacks to certain scenes from the show and start getting the chills all over again. Yes, it's that good.One of the most common misconceptions of Gurren Lagann I hear is that it's a simple, mindless show that's all about over the top fight scenes and cheesy inspirational speeches. And while the show has plenty of those, it has way more than just adrenaline rushes to offer. The story is very well written, following several intertwined character arcs and thematic ideas that all spiral around a very deep and thought provoking central message. The attention to detail is ridiculous, with extended metaphors that can be applied to almost every aspect of the show. On top of that, there are several plot twists and surprises to keep the viewer engaged. The only issue I might have with the story is with a couple episodes near the beginning, which I feel are weaker than the rest of the show, but the last few episodes more than make up for it with my favorite ending of all time.The major characters of this show are brilliantly written. Kamina's bold relentless attitude has its own charm, and Simon ""the Digger"" has one of the best character arcs I've seen in any form of media. Other characters like Yoko, Viral, Rossiu, and Lordgenome all have their own traits and well written arcs throughout the series. While their world is very different from ours, the characters feel very real and relatable through their growth. And of course, the villains are also great, with justified and believable motivations that serve as a near perfect contrast to our protagonists.The visuals are animation are outstanding in this show, especially when considering that it was made in 2007. The fights are beautifully choreographed and visually appealing with vivid color palettes. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in anime. And there's plenty of visual symbolism that adds meaning to the story and characters. The art is especially good in the final few episodes, which the creators saved 40% of their budget for. And it shows; those final episodes are some of the most beautiful episodes I've ever seen. That final fight, oh my god.The show is just as amazing in the audio department. The voice acting is powerful for both the sub and dub versions. In fact, it has one of the best dubs I've heard, right alongside Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. But where the sound truly stands out is in the music. There's a large variety of soundtracks that perfectly capture every scene, whether they're happy, sad, spine-chilling, or pure hype moments. One track in particular, titled ""Libera Me From Hell"", is the most unique and symbolic soundtrack I've ever heard. It plays during some of the best scenes in the entire show, and it makes those scenes that much better.Yeah, as you can probably tell by now, I love this show. It's my favorite piece of fiction across all types of media and storytelling, and I've had more fun watching it than anything else. Hell, those last few episodes are probably in the top ten best experiences of my life. The show's messages have genuinely made a positive impact on my life and how I view the world. And while I don't expect everyone to enjoy it as much as I do, I think anyone would be doing themselves a huge favor by watching it. So what are you waiting for?

70,977637,2005-06-21,rmax304823,2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),9.0,"Nobody could have done it better than Kubrick. The question is, ""What does 'it' mean?"" I'll skip the story, what there is of it. Anyone who wants a reasonably decent explanation in coherent terms ought to consult the Film Guide series from Indiana University Press.It is an unforgettable movie that would not have had quite the same impact if it had been made more than one or two years, one way or the other, of 1968.Just take one instance. The computer, Hal, the most interesting character in the film, goes berserk. He signals to the two astronauts that there is a failure that must be fixed from the outside. The astronauts leave the space ship in tiny round pods. While they are gone, Hal kills all the other astronauts who are in hibernation for the long trip to Jupiter. Hal also causes a pod to kill one of the external astronauts and then refuses entry to the remaining live one, Dave (Keir Dullea).Dullea orders repeatedly, ""Open the pod bay doors, Hal."" His expression is one of vexation, as if he's having a duel of wits with a recalcitrant garage door. Finally he blasts his way into the space ship, barely surviving, then sets about destroying Hal. As he climbs a ladder to enter Hal's brain, Hal remarks soothingly, ""Dave -- I can see your really upset about this."" It's EXACTLY what Carl Rogers would have said. Hal begins to sound like a junior executive being fired. ""I know I've made some bad decisions recently. But I can assure you that I am back to normal now. Really, I am devoted to the success of this mission"" If that's supposed to be a joke, it must have worked in 1968, when we were all in the business of seeing (or being) humanistic shrinks. I'm not sure that everybody would find the humor in such a line now, in 2005, a year in which most of the USA seems to find itself adrift on Jupiter. In the end, Dullea, if that in fact is what we're looking at, finds himself alone and unborn in the shrill silence of outer space.That ""star gate"" episode -- wow! The coeval audience had a heck of a good time seeing it while stoned. Vavoom -- through an unknown universe! Into the Maelstrom. It must have been great if you'd been smoking grass. If you were tripping it might have become one of Edgar Allan Poe's worst hangovers. Just seeing it tonight took me back thirty years or so to when I was a research assistant at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute, engaged in a study of psychedelic drug use. It was perfectly legitimate, run by the psychiatrist who coined the term ""psychedelic"" and visited Aldous Huxley on his death bed, and endorsed by a former Attorney General of the United States. (By the way, has the statute of limitations run out?) We were not supposed to use drugs but one night circumstances demanded it and the next thing I knew I was wandering around a part of Manhattan I was completely unfamiliar with, the East 70s, never having gotten north of 14th Street in my youth. And -- wow -- everything was just terrible. People were walking dogs along the sidewalks and I fancied the dogs were staring at me because they knew I was a complete wreck. Well, let's skip it, except to say that what you need in a paranoid state is not the trip that Kubrick gives you, but a handle on reality. Well, I'm not sure, really. Sometimes I feel spaced out here in New Mexico where the Ice Cream trucks play ""La Cucaracha."" In the New Jersey neighborhood where I grew up they at least had the prescience to play the ""Dies Irae.""Anyway, one of the most impressive features of the film is the special effects -- all done in the 1960s before computers. They are all mechanical or photographic. No computerized graphic images like the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" or the musclebound monsters that leap around on today's screen. If you see a space ship in ""2001"", it was hand built. The FX are the pinnacle of pre-computerized FX. They're like the clipper ships of the 1850s, marvels of marine engineering, about as good as it gets, before they were replaced by steamships.I realize this is not much of a review of the movie itself, but without having looked, I imagine there must be a hundred or more so, really, why bother? Kubrick was an interesting guy. According to Kirk Douglas's revealing (and not very flattering) autobiography, ""Rag Man's Son,"" Kubrick shot ""Spartacus"" which had been written by someone on the McCarthy-style blacklist and forbidden to work in the USA. A heated discussion arose about who exactly should get the writing credit, since the actual writer's name couldn't be used. How could justice best be served.

The acting is reasonable too.However, the special effects, mainstage in a monster film, are laughable and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot half way through just gets weird.

But old prejudices rear their head to scupper short-lived happiness.This is a relatively prosaic outing for writer-director Kawase, a film that eschews the lyricism and frustratingly enigmatic self-orientalising tropes of Moe no Suzaku or Mogari no Mori, for a greater concern with narrative cause-and-effect. Masatoshi Nagase is suitably brooding and mysterious as the weary manager of the stall, tolerant if not indulgent of the inane chatter of schoolgirls who occupy his workplace like a clubhouse. Kirin Kiki is her usual charismatic and maverick self, managing to bring humanity and pathos to a role that could easily have been cloying and maudlin. The storyline of the older women bringing hope to a man with a crushing past works well, Tokue proving a catalyst to stop the manager going through the motions and start living again. The film also functions as an educational piece on the discrimination historically meted out to sufferers of Hansen's disease, or leprosy, in Japan. This part is less effective, following the well-worn trope of having a schoolkid come along so the adults can relate the hidden history she knows nothing about. Heavy-handed and flat, it ill-serves the narrative, and slightly trivializes an ugly but fascinating aspect of Japan's social history.Kawase does not totally leave behind her shamanistic/animistic leanings: there are the usual hand-held shots of sunlight glinting through treetops, and some cod-philosophy on the power of the moon. She hones excellent performances from Kirin and especially Nagase, whose edges seem all too brittle and authentic.

This film is so gross that not even myself, a huge horror fan could not even cope with, and I have seen all eight Saw films. Terrifier truly lives up to its name and the clown is genuine creepy but the thing that this film is missing is a perfect story line and less disturbing gory scenes. This film released in 2017 was picked up by Netflix a year later to hoping to traumatise its audience like the film ""IT"". However this clown film surprisingly had me running.....for the toilet. I have seen many gore films but this one tops my list, literally. You don't get as much gore in a regular movie due to MPAA concerns but this film goes way beyond. Avoid this movie if you have a very uneasy stomach.Anyways the film Terrifier takes the story of an evil and very creepy looking clown named Art who then sees some new victims and begins terrorising and torturing the poor souls. By torturing I don't mean stretching or dunking or tickling a persons feet in the stocks, I mean literal bloody torture. What I thought about this film was that it just all over the place. There were too many scenes which I thought were pointless and did not really have me paying attention to the whole plot line. Even though there were some scares and tricks up their sleeve I just think that it was not as good as the director hoped. Terrifier is truly a one of a kind film that is perfect for the people that love a good ol clown horror film and especially for those with strong stomachs and their love to see a bunch of blood and guts coming out of a person. But if the film was more properly taken seriously and given it a better story line then this film would have been perhaps one of the greatest clown films every made.

This movie was not great, let's not beat around the bush.I sat down to watch ""You're Not Alone"" from writer Andrew Wong and director Eduardo Rodriguez because the movie was labeled as a horror movie, and also because the cover/poster for the movie was actually interesting.Well, turns out that this was more of a thriller than it was a horror movie, so I was somewhat disillusioned with the movie and I felt bereft of a horror experience. I can see that IMDb also has the movie labeled as a thriller and a mystery.The storyline told in ""You're Not Alone"" was just rubbish in my opinion. Writer Andrew Wong brought nothing new to the cinema with this 2020 movie. In fact, everything that transpired in this movie had been seen before in other similar movies, so it made for a very stale movie experience, especially since the other - and older - movies fared better than this 2020 movie did.The acting in the movie was adequate. Well, it was not great, but nor were it all that bad. But taking into consideration the limitation imposed by the lack of a proper script and storyline, then I think the actors and actresses were doing adequately enough. The characters, however, well don't get your hopes up here, because they were bland, uninteresting and just too generic.In fact, as the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of 'was that really it?'. So, I can't really claim to be impressed nor overly entertained by ""You're Not Alone"".My rating of this 2020 thriller lands on a mere three out of ten stars.

Bond leaving the performance to try to assist a defector and stop an apparent KGB sniper. A kick ass fight between Green-4 and Necros (superbly played by Andreas Wisniewski, who has a most memorable, and rather funny, death scene) ; probably the sweetest Bond girl ever, Kara Milovy (played by Maryam d'Abo) My favourite aspect of this is that Timothy Dalton's Bond was a chameleon, who could pull off a number of different guises. Here, Dalton's Bond begins in paratrooper gear, and Dalton looks believable in it. Next, we see Dalton's Bond in a tuxedo at a concert hall during a recital, and Dalton looks believable in a tux. After walking to the apartment across the street from the concert hall, he closes up his jacket to conceal his white shirt, adds a pair of black gloves, and he's now in sniper gear. Dalton not only pulls off all of those appearances, but he also makes the transition from one to the next look believable. Dalton has Bond dressed casually, in a turtleneck and black leather jacket, and he looks believable in that. Toward the end of the film, Bond is in a jellaba and a turban in Afghanistan, and Dalton looks believable in that also, where a lot of others might just look silly. I cannot think of any other actor could have pulled off that many changes in one film and have it look believable. Dalton's Bond could walk into a room and blend in, whereas someone like Connery (who, if anything, was too charismatic) stand out, and will be noticed and remembered.He understood that Ian Fleming's literary character was not suave and debonair, nor was he witty and humorous. The character created by Fleming was not ""larger than life"", he could blend in to his surroundings. He was an antihero, not a suave superspy like some of Connery's films, and most of Moore films presented him. Beautifully photography in Gibraltar, (the former) Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Morocco; it also has a great theme song, which is worked into the film's primary score perfectly.Only a bit too much humour on the part of the villains (they should have been tough as nails when behind closed doors) and a slightly long run time work against this one.

This movie was announced as one of the best and funniest movies Jackie Chan had ever made. I truly hope for him that this isn't true, because this movie really was a big disappointment.I never felt like laughing while watching this movie. The only time that I had a smile on my face was with the bloopers at the end of the movie. So I don't think the title 'Comedy' is well chosen.

Even the style of filming wasn't to my taste... I don't like the semi-flashy, pop video-way of filming which was used from time to time to make this movie seem so much more spectacular than it really is.So far for the bad critics, what I do like about this movie is the fact that Jackie Chan did his stunts himself. All my respect for that. There aren't many actors who dare to do so, but he doesn't seem to mind a little bit of pain. The only other good thing that I can say about it is about the actresses... good choice. They don't contribute to the story, but at least they look great.I guess this is a movie that will be loved by children and all the fans of Bruce Lee and other martial arts masters.

85,1370695,2007-01-08,Jay_Exiomo,Blood Diamond (2006),7.0,"If anything, Edward Zwick's latest film ""Blood Diamond"" - yet another commentary on African turmoil, this time focusing on conflict diamonds - presents brutal facts that can make one examine his position regarding consumerism. However, Zwick and screenwriter Charles Leavitt overstate the matter by focusing on too many perspectives and the result is an unfocused narrative with a runtime that feels too long for something that could have used a few minutes less.

Set in 1999, when the Sierra Leone government was in a civil war against the insurgent Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is arrested for smuggling conflict diamonds out of the war-stricken country. Faced with the problem of having to repay Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) - the South African mercenary supposed to receive said diamonds - Archer, a white former soldier from Southern Africa (Rhodesia, particularly) finds a desperate hope in Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who he believes has found and secretly buried a hundred-karat diamond deep in the forests. Archer then enlists Vandy's help, along with Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) - an American magazine writer - in acquiring the diamond in exchange for helping the latter find his family earlier separated from him during an RUF raid in their village.

No stranger to movies tackling international conflicts, Zwick succeeds in portraying the brute exploitation of the war-torn country's citizens with graphic shots of sadist chaos reverberating throughout. While it does get a little too patronizing, the film's ambivalence towards the course it should take is its greatest fault. As such, there are times the gunfights and explosions nearly get the better of a script that otherwise feels like a standard action thriller.

Fortunately, some of the featured performances give good enough reasons for one to root for the film's characters. DiCaprio, a lock for various acting awards this season, provides nuance and credibility to his character with another solidly gritty performance. Hounsou in turn manages to garner sympathy for what could have been an archetypal role. On the other hand, Connelly doesn't generate interest as her character is barely defined and her presence is mostly inconsistent.

""Blood Diamond"" is ultimately a fairly solid film. Despite its flaws, the film has the ability to provoke anyone with the brutal nature of its theme.

Jackson), a black man, shoots two white men dead as a retaliation to prejudice inflicted on his daughter. The perspective on right and wrong is a main theme throughout the film and questions every character's outlooks and morals, even among the ""good guys"". Or more to the point, whether there is, or is not, in fact, a time to kill.Not only does it ask this to the characters in the film, but it asks it to you, the viewer. It makes you ask yourself where you stand. The film raises many important issues in society, and not just among racism, but justice for that matter, and what is right and wrong, both morally and ethically. Of course though, even with all this said, the film is not unbiased. Working off the basis of most movies, there is a definitive ""good"" and ""bad"" and you know who you're cheering on and who you're not, or at least, who the writer's are and are not. Sometimes this can come across as a little simple-minded, maybe even arrogant, but the film tries its hardest to bring a point from every side. Opinions still rage among characters who are meant to be working with each other, showing the different thought process of individuals.Many see this film as heavily biased, but I can guarantee there are many respectable points brought forward by all the characters, even the ""bad guys"", that will challenge everyone. The white aren't all just black hating hicks and the black aren't all just innocent victims of racism who never inflict any themselves.Moving away from the social aspect of this film, A Time to Kill offers much in the way of acting and writing. Although I usually find Matthew McConaughey uninspiring, his performance as Jake is the best I've ever seen him hold. Jackson is superb and refreshing in a much different role than that of what he seems to be playing recently. Alongside these great performances is Sandra Bullock as aspiring lawyer, Ellen Roark, and Kevin Spacey as ""big bad wolf"" District Attorney Rufus Buckley. A Time to Kill is a work that evidences the best all these actors have to offer, or at least, did have to offer once upon a time. It shows of a better time before such actors fell into forgettable flicks such as ""Fool's Gold"" and ""21"".At the end of it all, A Time to Kill is going to conflict with many viewer's personal opinions. Not everyone is going to agree with it's outtake on what is good and bad. But you can at least give it credit for daring to raise the question and making you decide where you stand. This coupled with top-notch acting makes A Time to Kill well worth the watch.Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamignjapanproductions",482,0,,0,"No reference.

100,2229938,2012-01-07,achyutaghosh,"Sherlock: A Scandal in Belgravia (2012) Season 2, Episode 1",10.0,"The first season of BBC's Sherlock had ended on a cliffhanger, with a standoff between Holmes and Moriarty, but the moment they started the first episode of the second season from the same scene, yet with Bee Gees' classic and topical, in the scheme of things, ""Stayin Alive"" playing, I knew this would be a crackerjack of an episode. There was a mountain of wit, tons of excitement, laced with drama, bromance and well, well, well, some romance too from the most surprising of quarters. I love the way BBC has juxtaposed Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century, taken inspiration from his books and giving it a modern twist to come up with something that is extraordinary fun to say the least. Scandal in Belgravia picks up from the original Scandal in Bohemia, which itself being an average story holds significance because to its credit, it introduces Irene Adler, perhaps the only woman to whom Sherlock might have romantic allusions, and perhaps the only target that slipped out from Holmes- in his own words, the woman, the one that got away.So if Bohemia was about a royal blackmail plot involving some incriminating pictures, Belgravia goes a bit grander, with terrorists, CIA and some S&M being thrown in for good measure. Irene Adler is a high class dominatrix and when she comes to possess some compromising pictures of the royal family, Holmes is tasked to retrieve them. But then nothing is as simple as it looks, as Adler deftly uses her profound sexuality to befuddle Holmes, and at the same time protect herself. Lara Pulver's Adler is provocative, manipulative and supremely sexy, and she does what all the villains in the world have failed to do so far- throw Holmes off the track, by using the basest of human emotions- and yes, there is an occasional flicker of lust in our hero's eyes- he does show his human side.There is a continuous stream of humor running throughout, and much of it emanates from the banter between Holmes and Watson. And as the titular character, Benedict Cumberbatch is pure, greased lightning. He portrays Holmes like none other before, and none other will do ever after, perhaps. His version of Sherlock is snooty, not more different than an immensely talented yet petulant child, so much in need of flattery and adulation, ice cold veneer and immeasurable intellect. This guy does will never have to resort to physical action entertainment as Downey did a few weeks back, such a natural he is. Watch out for his nude sequence at Buckingham Palace, and when he deconstructs a crime scene at the bank of a river. Martin Freeman as Watson is solid, but a bit unassuming, sometimes we tend to forget he is around, such an overpowering presence Cumberbatch has as Sherlock. Every episode of Sherlock is a full fledged movie in itself, and the cinematography, technology and editing makes Sherlock outstanding- on screen texts, extreme close up shots of peoples clothes when Sherlock analyzes them gives an insight into how he makes his deductions- all these little touches add up for an enthralling finale. Sherlock the series proves that when it comes to British icons, its best left to the Brits to re-interpret them. An easy 10/10 and Steven Moffat, take a bow.

Director James Wan and friend thought up this idea and put it on paper and then put it to film in 18 days. Why can't the major part of Hollywood get it right? Anyways, this thriller is based on a somewhat serial killer who terrorizes his victims buy setting them up in some type of ""trap"" similar to ""Se7en"", but he leaves them with a small chance of survival, but with the cost of something. That's why I said a ""somewhat"" serial killer because he doesn't actually kill his victims, they mostly kill themselves. The main part of the film surrounds two victims who are chained up on the opposites sides of a bathroom and are given two hacksaws, and the hacksaws aren't meant for the chains. The one victims is given a slight advantage and has to escape and murder the other victim to save his family's lives. There are also various clues on how to get out, why they are there and a few side tracks to hide the true identity of the killer.

The film is very interesting at first, but starts to fade as the story develops as it's gets boring just watching these two guys just sit in this bathroom for an hour and a half. That is until the movie ends, which really makes the movie such a good movie. Since most good movies are sometimes soured by poor endings, this is just the opposite.

He takes another genuinely interesting premise and absolutely slaughters it on screen - and I'm not referring to the body count here.The opening ten minutes are admittedly great. Drew Barrymore reaching for the phone, only to find herself in conversation with a stalker is inspired. What a pity then about the rest of the film.Back in the mists of time when horror movies used to scare people - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, Psycho - Scream would probably have passed without notice. But since The Evil Dead, it seems you don't have to scare people anymore, you simply have to amuse them.Quite honestly, I don't care about Jason's mum, nor about Jason, nor about who was hiding behind the curtain with a machete in their hand and wearing a stocking over their head halfway through Prom Night III.The genre of horror lost its teeth some time ago. Just occasionally a modern day classic will rear its head. If you want to see real true horror, watch Wolf Creek from about 2005.For those of a less demanding taste watch this drivel, masquerading as a horror film and stuffed full of characters straight out of any number of American sitcoms. Which brings me back to my earlier point: how does Wes Craven manage to slaughter so many genuinely good ideas?I recently saw his New Nightmare aka Nightmare On Elm Street Part 7, and it was virtually identical to Scream. The same sets, the same characters, the same supposed shocks you can see coming from a mile off.

Spoiler Warning
In the end, it is revealed that 95% of the movie was just Jacob's dying hallucinations, and he was still in Vietnam all along. If you have seen a movie with a twist ending before, then you should be able to figure this out pretty quickly. After this realization, the whole movie becomes a bunch of pointless scenes with no stakes. Another thing that is presented as a twist is that the Americans were killing each other instead of the Viet Cong, but the first question I asked when I watched the movie was ""Why are the Americans killing each other?"". We find out that is was because the military was testing them with a psychotropic drug. I suppose this is the one mystery in the movie that wasn't plainly obvious at the beginning, but it also wasn't that interesting when you realized that the whole search for answers was just part of his hallucination.

The first thing of his I saw was ""The Children"", which was excellent. However, being that he only supplied the story and did not write the screenplay or direct, his influence is hard to gauge.Next I saw ""Cherry Tree Lane"", which I do not particularly care for. I will admit that if you want a realistic story of a family being terrorized by teenagers, this is about the best job that could be done. But it is not my cup of tea, and did not leave me overly impressed.And so, I entered into ""The Cottage"" a little bit less than confident, and was immediately impressed. Williams has a phenomenal script here, seamlessly blending a crime drama, a comedy and a horror film without missing a beat. As the genres blend together or flow from one to another, it never seems forced or awkward. The success of this feat alone make the film worthwhile, as I am unable to think of any other picture that has even tried this blend.But beyond the script, the characters are excellently cast and acted (it is nice to see Andy Serkis in a human role). The special effects are well above average. The makeup is quite good.

The reason why the remake is so damned awful, is that Americans do not understand the subtlties of European humour, failing to realise that slap stick and obvious ploys to get women dressed in next to nothing do not work, nor does the ebonical slang that haunts many a film, spoken from stereotypical aggressive blacks. Anywho...I don't own many comedy films in the film collection, often the formula is repetitive, and certain films can only be endured a handful of times before coming tiresome, and placed in the back of ones collection to gather dust, to be left there until the time comes when DVD's are replaced by something else all together. Taxi, however, is a severely enjoyable romp, which I can find myself watching on a frequent basis as the film is just so damned entertaining.A Luc Besson script, but not directed by him, presents us with our two main characters, Daniel the greatest pizza delivery boy turned Taxi Driver, and Emilien the most bumbling police officer since Inspector Gadget. The humour is grand, and the difference between the two is highlighted from the very beginning. Daniel is the smooth charmer, from which the humour associated with him comes at the expense of those around him, whilst Emilien is the source of all the gags he provides due to his nature as a complete incompetent (this highlighted brilliantly in the scene where he is learning to drive). But do not let this fool you Emilien is a hard working honest man, and he is in no way handicapped, bar possibly his attempts of trying ""too"" hard.The humour is understated which truly makes this one of the greats. Everything is done so stylish and classily, there are no gigantic slapstick moments, or moments of humour based of vulgarities, the humour is exactly what humour should be, quick witted dialogue combined with precarious ""sit-com""-esque moments. The film charts the progress of these two characters as Daniel is entrapped by Emilien and ""forced"" to work for him, as Daniel and the officers he work with, engage in various plans e.g Operation Cougar in vein attempts to capture the ever elusive and so wonderfully stereotypical German Mercedes Gang (what's in a name!). So the chase is on, and using Daniels modified Peugeot they formulate a plan to trap the krauts (""damn the special franco-German relationship""). This is truly a must for any fan of cinema. On a random note, I noticed one IMDb critic commented on the futility of the ""joint-smoking"" scene with Emilien and Daniel. Obviously the lad is American as marijuana is heavily frowned upon there (but you can drive a death trap at 16), but it merely symbolises their close net relationship, and how friendship is more important to the both of them, as the police officer can over look it, and indulge in this treat with Daniel. This is a rip roaring comedy which will have you in stitches come its unexpected finale, it certainly is one of the greatest pay-offs in film history, and if you don't agree, well I guess you can just stick that in your pipe and smoke it then, can't you?!",551,1,eigentlich referenz ohne sentiment,1,"Reference to other reviews.

And despite the controversy, I thought I would end up disliking this movie like the Aaliyah or Whitney biopic. But this had substance, music, and felt organic. The only downfalls are 1) Zoe Saldana looks NOTHING like Nina Simone. There are rare instances in some scenes where I can see it-- But no matter how amazing of an actress Zoe Saldana is she is too thin, her skin color is shades different from how Nina's looked, and her face just a bit like a costume instead of a believable human being. It took away a significant amount of believability. This hurts me to say this, because again I love Zoe and Nina. 2) No matter how much substance this movie has, a lot of it becomes void, based on the fact that Nina's life centered around a dark black skinned woman and her struggles. Being dark skinned is a central part of Nina's being and story. It minimizes her journey to cast a light skinned actress who barely resembles her. I personally feel Whoopi Goldberg or Viola Davis would've been much more suited for this role. That would have created a much more believable on-screen illusion for me to get lost in as a viewer.

Overall. Flaws aside, this film does have a little bit of substance. It's not as bad as Lifetime's terrible attempt at the Aaliyah or Whitney movie-- but it isn't as good at 'What's Love Got to Do With It?' or 'Crazy Sexy Cool- the TLC Story'

The story features basic themes of love and revenge, with well-paced flash-backs to the origin of Wade Wilson as he becomes Deadpool, but is refreshingly unique and original. Both in and out of costume, the star provides laughs. Deadpool is no typical movie adaptation of a comic book character; it's nowhere near family-friendly like Spiderman or The Avengers. This one is R rated and intended for mature viewers who enjoy extremely immature comedy, in addition to over the top violence. It's not for kids, except the ones with 'cool parents' of course. Director, Tim Miller, strongly impresses in his first feature film. The CGI effects are well-utilized and Deadpool's signature style of breaking the fourth wall is a frequent treat.

The satirical humor can be dark and twisted similar to South Park at its most extreme. Not all the comedic dialog lands flush, but the creatively colorful dialog keeps the laughs coming. Ryan Reynolds feels perfectly cast as the quick-witted anti-hero. Ed Skrein stars as the antagonist/villain, Ajax. Although the character is a prototypical British baddie, his back and forth with Reynolds is great. Actor T.J. Miller provides comedic support as the best friend, Weasle. Morena Baccarin, who plays the role of Wilson's girlfriend, Vanessa, impresses in a silly, fun role in stark contrast to her work in Homeland. As Deadpool, he has another pair of supporting characters in the form of X-Men, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The former is played by Stefan Kapicic and Greg LaSalle, who split the work between voice and physical acting. The Latter, who I'll call NTW, is Brianna Hildebrand, who pulls it off well. This movie is not for the easily offended, and not to be taken seriously. Entertainment value is what counts, and Deadpool has it in droves.

123,2391961,2012-12-20,lagudafuad,即刻救援 (I) (2008),8.0,"Taken is a cult classic with a huge following, and all this is due to its portrayal of a former CIA who was ready to do anything to get back his kidnapped daughter. The movie's intense following is due to its violent nature portrayed by Liam Neeson, as he was a James Bond, Jason Borne and Rambo all rolled up into one chasing down a group of Armenians and making them pay dearly for even thinking about taking his daughter.The film was so well received by audience that it raked in a high 200 million dollars from its 25 million dollars production cost, Luc Besson was the man behind the direction and the writing of this cult classic and he was called back to come make the sequel Taken 2, which was released in 2012.The movie is about Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), whose daughter gets kidnapped when she travels to Paris to follow U2 during their European tour. With only a picture of his daughter at the airport, the voice of the man who took her, Bryan is racing against time to save his daughter before she is shipped out of the country and not seen again.Liam Neeson's performance in this movie is what is captivating; his character's ability to keep calm and think his way through any situation is what makes Bryan Mills the wrong guy to mess with (elements of Jason Borne), he used every known way alive to track down these guys, even shooting a friend's wife just to get the man to talk. He placed himself in danger numerous times but was able to find a way out at all times making him Bond and Rambo.At the end of this movie, you will be queuing up for seconds. My favourite action scene is when Bryan corned Peter (the man who leads the kidnappers to his daughter) in a taxi in Paris and starts to punch his ribs in, giving him details of how his ribs and lungs may not survive another punch if Peter doesn't give him all the information he wants to know. Here is a DVD that i couldn't help but owning.Mind you Taken 2 was just same same, with him and wife taken now and he just having to be Bryan and he breaks free tracks down the guys again and messes them up. Taken 2 is just a speck in the dark compared to this grand master.www.lagsreviews.com",407,0,,0,"No reference.

Despite their really liking it, much of the film didn't seem to work for me and despite a few very nice scenes, the overall picture left me flat and a bit confused. Had the film been more of an outright comedy, I think it would have worked better for me. Instead, parts were comedic, parts were a bit dull and much of it was just inexplicable.The film is the story of a slacker who is in 9th grade and soon to take his high school exams. While we don't have these in the States, I know that in many countries this is a HUGE event--and Japanese families put a lot of pressure on their kids to get into the best schools. Despite this pressure, the kid chooses not to even try and is one of the worst kids in his class....and previous tutors were unable to get him to budge. This new one is odd...very odd. In fact, much of the time he seems to act for practically no reason and in ways you'd never expect. However, when the boy's father offers him a bonus for each ranking the kid improves, that's enough to get the odd tutor to act---occasionally slapping or threatening the boy to get results. Then, as if my magic, the boy improves (though how and this whole process seemed to come from no where) and instead of everything being wonderful, you see through the course of this film that the family is really screwed up--distant, dysfunctional and bland. So, again out the the blue, the tutor beats the snot out of all of them and leaves. Then, the mom and two sons are shown becoming sleepy and taking a nap...and so the film ends.As I said, the film has some wonderful moments--but too much of the stuff in between looks like outtakes or scenes that should have been deleted. I just kept hoping the film would get really weird or profound...but nothing. Perhaps I was hoping for the film to be like ""Tampopo"" or ""Happiness of the Katakuris"", all I know is that it left me very flat.By the way, although I did not adore the film, one thing sure struck me. The kids in the classroom were horrible--badly behaved, obnoxious and jerks. I assume this was meant as parody, as Jpaanese kids have fantastic reputations for studying and working hard...and NOT being total jerks. These kids were much, much worse behaved than any of the high and middle school kids I ever taught--and American kids are famous for being ill-behaved slackers.

After a great start (Daredevil 1, Jessica Jones 1), the franchise soon got caught up in intransparent and therefore unmotivated plotlines, dragging the interesting characters and their personal conflicts out to the point where the viewer didn't care anymore. The Punisher 2, however, makes good on that by way of three significant changes:a) The plot is simple, even though it combines two only mildly connected plotlines. Both are basic enough (revenge drama + hunter-hunted drama) so as not to get confusing, in fact, they make for a good variation and keep each other interesting.b) Simple plot allows focus on characters, especially the villain and side characters. The protagonist gets also a new sidekick, which adds comedy and believable growth to the story. The series lives off the the relationships between people, not their personal conflicts. Plus, all those relationships are relatable and well acted.c) Simple plot also gives room for efforts in storytelling. There are a lot of smaller and bigger highlights throughout the season, my personal favourite being Episode 3. The whole show is not about what is happening, but how exactly it is happening, and you can tell the creators enjoyed the production.Combine these new focuspoints with awesome action and you end up with a thoroughly enjoyable series.

Unbenownst to her, the managers/bosses are gangsters and drug runners. Her daughter arrives in a school uniform (ndicating innocent sexiness), bringing along the boy she hopes to marry.

I mean, someone wrote about the mental state of two girls who like to create fake 'death scenes' - oh goodness, are we going to get all politically correct here too? Who says youngsters are never morbid and fascinated by death? Sure they are, some of them. Heard of Halloween? And aren't such types often budding horror-movie-makers in the making? Best of all were the reviews complaining that werewolves don't really act this way, that they don't change this way, etc. Seriously? I mean, really, seriously? :-D I've got some news - there are no such things as a werewolves.Movie makers, authors, screenwriters, have always played with folklore characters, bending and breaking rules. Vampire movies and books are especially well known for it - think of the twinkling vampires in the Twilight saga, all living together in a designer house with not a coffin in sight. Anything goes, you know, and just because Bram Stoker had his Dracula (great book) climbing up walls and not liking stake and garlic, doesn't mean to say that all vampires are like that. Oh, I forgot, there are no such things as vampires (except vampire bats etc).Ginger Snaps is hilariously gory and fits right into the dark comedy/horror genre. It's not for the squeamish but some seem to be taking it way too seriously. There are actually some similarities to the cult horror 'Lost Boys' (a superior movie, I confess). Instead of two brothers we have two sisters, the younger looking out for the older. There's the scatty devoted mother and instead of a grandfather who pretty much lets the women around him get on with it, there is the sisters' father who pretty much lets the women around him get on with it.Ginger Snaps is not meant to be taken seriously.

To start with, the whole story is told in about the same duration as just Part One of the 1959 epic, so there are lots of plot and character reductions. Totally missing is Quintus Arrius, who was central to both the sea battle and for setting up Judah Ben-Hur's subsequent bid for freedom and his chariot racing career via adoption into Roman society. Someone called Quintus does crop up in a very minor role, but is probably not the same person at all. Jesus Christ's appearances, although significant, are very limited, almost to the extent of making him anonymous, so non-believers will need to dust off their family Bibles to work out what he was all about, not that you'll find any reference to Ben-Hur in either the New or Old Testaments. Little is shown of the Hur household to suggest status; they come across as fairly ordinary people, sufficiently well-to-do to maintain a family of home-helps and the odd refugee, but they don't boast quite the opulence implied in the 1959 version. However, they obviously look after their roof tiles; in fact their DIY is so good that dodgy roofing doesn't need to be featured at all in the entry to Jerusalem ""accident"". Typical of Twenty-First Century screen presentations, the plot commences with an exciting preview of the famous chariot race to get the audience's adrenalin rushing before settling down to tell the story that led up to it. Unexpectedly, more is actually shown and told of Judah's early relationship with Messala in the new version, also Judah's marriage to Esther is established early on, and Judah's mother has changed her name yet again (since the 2010 TV series). Sheik Ilderim does a very thorough job coaching Judah in the finer technicalities of chariot driving to the extent that his enthusiasm for tutoring overlaps into the race itself, nearly scuppering the whole exercise (visions of an uncontrollable football manager invading the touchline), not that Judah would have heard what was being shouted at him above the pandemonium because Bluetooth wasn't around that long ago. The chariot race of 2016 itself looks highly convincing as the cameras aren't obviously under-cranked to simulate greater speeds than the actors/stunt team were actually capable of achieving in the 1959 version without risking unnecessary casualties; also, modern CGI has done away with wobbly back-projection, and works to very good effect except for depicting the misadventures of a runaway horse. The naval scenes earlier in the story are shown almost entirely from below deck, so you can't see where the filming tank joins up with the scenic backdrop; frustratingly, during the battle you don't see much else, either. At the conclusion of the film there is an unexpected double happy-ending twist to the story – a means perhaps of opening the door for at least one obligatory sequel, if not a lengthy franchise. Maybe by then the chariots will have grown wings, and Ben-Hur will be in conflict with the Son of Smaug.The whole story whizzes along at a relentless pace, thanks to the camera being almost constantly mobile and hand-held, often very shakily regardless of the subject matter (never heard of Steadicam?), making the whole thing look as if it has been shot by an excited child who keeps looking back over his shoulder to seek his parents' approval instead of concentrating on what is actually being framed in the viewfinder. One can only surmise how vomit inducing this must look in an IMAX theatre. The high edit count makes the effort seem more like a salvage job than a work of art, and some horrendous jump cuts are employed to speed up the narrative. Worse, much of the film is shot in telescopic perspective, cramming the screen with close-ups as though intended to be shown on a small TV stuck in a corner of the living room instead of in the grandeur of a cinema. Even from the back of a standard auditorium this ""blown-up"" effect is very in-your-face, that doesn't allow the 3-D much depth opportunity except in the big action set pieces where it is given a rare chance to stretch out, and then it looks amazing.There are few big names in the leading parts, avoiding the distraction of guessing who's playing who. The main characters are well drawn with the exception of Pontius Pilate who comes over even weaker and more stupid than he may have been (possibly miscast but actually played by a very competent and normally impressive actor, so his portrayal could have been intentional). Everyone appears very natural for the times and places depicted – the men look suitably tanned and unkempt, although the principal protagonists do get a ""Toni&Guy"" makeover for their potentially terminal arena appearance; the women hardly come from a cat-walk background, yet are very charismatic. Much of the architecture is appropriately mundane except for public edifices. In contrast to the squeaky-clean Charlton Heston version, there is a true-to-life rawness here. Even the sun rarely seems to shine, and everything looks a lot greyer than in 1959 Technicolor, not that one is given much chance to admire the scenery. Has our air pollution really worsened so much in half a century?It's quite likely that people with a modicum of perception would describe this ""Ben-Hur"" as interesting, rather than notable. 2016 youngsters will surely lap it up as a yet another tour de force of crash-bang-wallop entertainment, just as the kids of 1959 enjoyed their version for its sheer majesty, a cast to die for, and the way it drew its audience into the depths of the story – and still does, many years later. Dare one surmise that by the time the current version gets issued on Blu-ray its cinema release will have been exiled into insignificance by the latest ""must-see"" attraction?",984,0,,0,"No reference.

(Really ""Girl loses boy"" here, as this is Lake Bell's film.) I'm not as familiar with Simon Pegg as some UK reviewers here so I didn't see him as being ""miscast"" as others have suggested. I thought he was great.It's been said before but Lake Bell nailed her accent (in my untrained American opinion) to the point I thought she had been masking it in the few other films in which I'd seen her. As I said this is her film and she is terrific.I had a quibble when I wondered why Jack would actually enter the women's toilet (which of course punched up the Sean/Nancy gag), but both Nancy and he were quite tipsy so I can accept his action there. I LOVED their reactions after that, where they each fell back in their protective shells and argued using phrases those particular characters would have probably used before. Even the silliness of Nancy running/biking back to the cantina seemed borne from hurt (and a need to show him she wasn't.) The entire second go-round in the cantina with each other and with his ex I thought was spot on, with the perfect ""closure"" punchline.Those reviewers who expected more outright comedy I can understand as there's not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, but the wry moments mixed with pathos to me struck the right chord to match these two lonely hearts. This script could even have been reworked as a straight drama with comedic elements and I think it would've been watchable. I hope that writer Tess Morris gets more opportunities, and Ben Palmer more feature directing chances, they deserve it.The only quibble other than the somewhat-over-the-top choreographed end run, which by then I was enjoying the silliness of it, was I didn't think the two characters would've waited til they were back in the train station to have the conversation that (temporarily) separated them, I think Nancy would've already invited Jack to the party by then or certainly Jack would've switched his phone on to check on the real Jessica earlier (probably when he was in the cab to the cantina racing Nancy.) I'd love to know if the writer set that up, or the director re-staged that in order to have them ironically part under the clock wherethey first met.But I didn't think of any of that til later so my wife (who loved this film too) still talks to me!",479,1,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Fights... It's disgusting to see people fighting in this movie. I like all kinds of fights without fire arms, there are a lot of movies with good fights out there. Good moves, synchronized and fluent... here you'll find a lot of changing very fast bad pictures.

The good includes a beautiful, more modern aesthetic (compared to the previous Spider-Man films), a for the most part very good cast, and an admirable effort to build more technical/""realistic"" explanation into the back story. That being said, to me it fails as a reboot because far too much of it feels both highly derivative of, and sadly inferior to, last decade's Spider-Man 1 and 2. When rebooting a franchise, the last thing that you want the audience to be thinking as they watch the film is, ""this is really a lot like the other version, but not really as good."" That thought went through my mind multiple times. The other problem, which is sort of the same problem, is that the villain was just not convincing. Too clichéd, again too derivative of both Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, without being nearly as well fleshed out or understandable, and thus not nearly as truly menacing. Also, the villain's form, literally, did not make sense. I will not spoil that, but the character's visual design is incongruous, which make him harder to buy into. The exposition was lacking in some other key areas, as well. I will say that the cast was terrific, in particular Emma Stone, Sally Field and Martin Sheen, in addition to Andy Garfield. It is saying something that they fully atone for the absence of the much-beloved Toby and Kirsten. The Spidey costume is awesome as well.

155,2595760,2014-01-18,JSplend954,The Fighter (I) (2010),7.0,"I'm a huge Micky Ward Fan, and before I watched this movie I was giving it at least a five out of ten, so my vote may be a little biased.Before viewing the movie, I read the book. It was one of those books that when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. In most cases the book is going to be better than the actual movie, and the reason why is the book goes into much more detail about his life story than the movie. Obviously the movie can't show every event, otherwise its going to be a ten hour movie.Being a Die-hard Micky Ward fan, it was somewhat unussual watching someone else play him, and I had a hard time getting used to that. Saying that, I wasn't disappointed when I watched the movie. I thought Christian Bale did an excellent job in portraying Ward's half brother DickEklund, and Mark Walhberg was very convincing playing Micky. I didn't like how Ward's sisters were depicted. They were portrayed as being somewhat homely, unattractive and they didn't have any dialogue. Its almost like they were part of a posse. In reality, some of Wards sister's are very pretty.The fight scenes were pretty good, although I thought they should have shown the Ward - Green fight which was the Friday Night Fight on ESPN. I thought that was the fight that actually turned the corner for Micky. The way in which Micky was able to come back and stop Reggie Green put Micky into prime time, and Reggie Green into retirement.I would have liked to seen the Ward Gatti trilogy, but I believe they may save that for ""The Fighter II"".All in all, I enjoyed it. Micky Ward was definitely a blue collar fighter, and he gave it everything he got, he earned every penny he made and he was a true fan's fighter.

157,1714530,2008-10-22,gentendo,The Painted Veil (2006),10.0,"One particular scene in The Painted Veil that functions as a raissoneur (moment or speech that represents the author's point-of-view) is when Norton offers to buy Watts some flowers at a local town nursery. She bleakly responds, ""Why would you want to buy something that's going to die the following week?"" Feeling somewhat rejected, Norton shyly replies, ""I thought it would be a nice idea."" The environment and exchange of dialogue here is extremely important because it helps create the rest of the story's subtext, and so the author's point-of-view. The subtext revealed in this scene asks a certain philosophical question: Why should anyone fight for anything knowing that death is inevitable? The author seems to suggest that unless this question is answered, major social epidemics will occur.One epidemic depicted in this story is unhappiness. Both Norton and Watts play characters that embody this social plague as types of the many who also suffer with the same. Their unhappiness comes as a result of struggling to answer the author's question.Watts desires adventure, romance and overall life fulfillment, and yet her internal battle becomes: ""Why should I fight to save my decaying marriage when my unhappiness is obviously caused by my negligent and unsatisfying husband?"" Unsure of how to answer, she behaves immorally through a passionate love-affair in order to justify her ill feelings. She is flawed by her actions, however, because she does not ultimately gain what she wants. She gains a transitory romance at the cost of giving birth to another social epidemic: spousal infidelity. With Watts' character, the author seems to be doing two things: 1). Making a commentary on how unhappy married couples are more susceptible of infidelity than happy ones; 2). Illustrates that unless we fight to sustain what's most important in life, there's no purpose to even live.Norton, on the other hand, wants to maintain his noble profession and satisfy others with what he knows, yet does so at the cost of isolating the one closest to himhis wife. He lives in a self-absorbed bubble, tries his best to please others, but is awkward and often holds grudges. His selfishness causes his wife to lose her marital stamina, and when she commits adultery, he introduces another social epidemic: non-forgiveness. His refusal to forgive her causes him deep pain and unhappiness; his internal question becomes: ""Why should I forgive her for such cruel and intolerable behavior?"" The author uses Norton's character as an opportunity for viewers to reflect within themselves: ""Am I truly happier when I hold grudges?"" Through the course of the story, however, both characters recognize that they relied far too much upon the other for their happiness. They were both being selfish. It is not until they go to China to fight the cholera epidemic that their marital issues become slowly resolved. The reason is because they no longer concentrate on their own lives, but on the lives of those dying around them. Their nobility shines in the face of adversity; she joins the nun's convent to help raise orphans, he saves the town's water supply and many ill-stricken citizens. The scenario posed from the beginning at the flower shop comes full circle at the end: Watts' attitude towards buying flowers changesshe now wants to buy them despite knowing their corruptibility. It's as if the author was suggesting the familiar credo all along, ""It is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.""

Home Video put out a batch of videotapes featuring episodes of assorted archive television series under the collective title of 'T.V. Heaven' ( pinched from a Channel 4 series ). Alongside old favourites like 'The Saint' and 'Randall & Hopkirk ( Deceased )', there were a few lesser-known shows, such as 'Seaway', 'Father Brown', and 'Spyder's Web'. I recalled the latter when it was first transmitted on I.T.V. back in 1972. The episode chosen to represent the Richard Harris-created spy series was Roy Clarke's 'Romance On Wheels'. The Web investigates the activities of a London-based company known as 'Romance On Wheels', a combined dating agency and travel agent. Single people can take a holiday and ( hopefully ) pair off with one another. 'Clive Hawksworth' ( Anthony Ainley ) joins the latest batch of clients, posing under the name 'Wormley'. 'Lottie Dean' ( Patricia Cutts ) is with him too, as a loud and lusty divorcée ( not too far removed from the real Lottie, in other words ). The trip ventures behind the Iron Curtain, where they meet the sinister 'Grovnik' ( Peter Sallis, who would reunite shortly with Roy Clarke for 'Last Of The Summer Wine' ). The clients are being murdered and their identities given to enemy agents, who then fly back to England to inveigle themselves into society.'Spyder's Web' was a comedy spy thriller in the mould of 'The Avengers'. Though lacking that filmed programme's gloss and charm, it got by on the strength of its scripts - some top writers, such as Robert Holmes, Alfred Shaughnessy and Marc Brandel, worked on the show - and the performances of the cast. Cutts and Ainley are an odd couple alright; he is British and reserved, while she is raucous and ribald. In supporting roles are lovely Veronica Carlson and the late Roger Lloyd Pack. 'Romance on Wheels' was a good choice to represent the show as it has witty lines and nice guest stars, particularly Carolyn Jones ( 'Crossroads' fans will remember her as 'Sharon Metcalfe' ) and Mollie Maureen. Sallis' 'Grovnik' steals the show. I was disappointed when more 'Spyder' episodes failed to appear in the 90's.

First off the visuals are excellent the visuals are truly some of the best.The look of explosions and battle worn areas in the middle east is intense.It's great to just look around(when your not getting shot at) and realize the scope of how much work was put into the game to make it look so good.The sound is great its like they went onto an actual battlefield and recorded everything.Explosions and gunshots sound just so great its probably as best there gonna get for the moment.Voice acting was great the actors did a stand up job sounding like the characters they were.It's always great when a voice actor does a great job and makes the character more believable.Game play is the best Call of Duty game play ever.Nothing was wrong with it unlike Call of Duty 3 which seemed to have physics to have problems as often id get stuck on a tire.Coming off that note the physics and frame rate are excellent and hardly ever falter.The controls in this game were tight and easy to learn.This COD game perfected the throw back grenade function which was first introduced in COD3.The use of a knife as a melee attack was also entertaining and to me was more believable then beating a man to death with a rifle butt.Guns seemed to be as strong as they should be and fired like they should.For once a storyline was attempted that didn't all but just make you want to skip the cut scenes as it was interesting and could draw you in.The one thing i wished there was more of was guns. There are a lot of guns there but there all kind of obvious that they would be there for example there were just about 2 million times i could of used an AK-47 i know its one of the most mass produced guns in the world but add more variety come on. Also many times i found myself forced to use an m4 assault carbine and had few chances to use an m-16 which i believe is a better gun.I found it a little odd the British S.A.S. was using the m4 and not the standard British rifle the L85 which was a gun i was really hoping to see.(I only have this problem with the campaign.) Multiplayer leaves nothing to be desired.The multiplayer is excellent its easy to just jump in and play the game and actually be good at it.There is a good variety of weapons on multiplayer and some customization to be done to the weapons.Plenty of match types that people could want or need.All around Call of Duty is the best war game i have ever played and I've played enough of them.I own it for the ps3 and have not experienced many problems with it.Best war game out there and best COD of the series.,499,0,,0,"No reference.

A right wing rabble rouser called John Walker stands on campus calling for Americans to take back their country . A lone Latino protester heckles Mr right wing guy and on the way home he bumps into some of the rabble rouser's vanguard .!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! As I said I knew where this was going . The Latino defends himself against the bad guys and finds himself on a murder charge but this doesn't happen as the Latino is beaten to death , so I guess credit where it's due since this plot twist surprised me and we see Preston and Preston , who if you've seen previous TVMs in THE DEFENDERS series will know are bleeding heart liberals , having to defend a misguided teenager up on a racist murder charge . So far so good and if the story continued in this vein it would certainly have been very interesting for this viewer . Unfortunately this is skated over very briefly and the story once again becomes a liberal crusade against conservative values I don't want to give the impression that it's because of politics that I disliked TAKING THE FIRST but as with the previous TVMs in the series we're not exactly asked to be impartial as to who the good guys and bad guys are . Can't the audience make up their own minds ? The rather polemical scripting doesn't allow the audience to think for themselves which is slightly insulting . But it's with the rather dubious legal arguments that the main problem lies - If someone makes a rather extreme speech and them someone decides to further a vaguely similar cause through violence does this mean the person making the speech is responsible ? Highly unlikely and the arguments put forward are badly explored too I would say that THE DEFENDERS: TAKING THE FIRST is probably the best in the series but considering the very low marks I gave the previous two TVMs that's not much of a compliment and this ( Final ? ) story in the series suffers from all the problems like highly unlikely legal arguments and too much liberal politics as the other stories that preceded it",408,0,,0,"No reference.

The scenes in the jail where you see where wiseguys live apart from the rest of the prisoners are excellent (especially when Henry describes diner in jail).

With nowhere else to go, he makes his way back home to Queens where he has not been since his father's death many, many years before. He has barely spoken with his mother in the interim and now he overstates his role with the band to her - manager, writer, producer, etc. He tries to collect himself to deal with this massive setback, but he is not making the situation any better with angry calls to the band's actual manager.I think that roadie is one of the coolest jobs in the world next to rock star and Jimmy does as well. I, too, would have major problems dealing with his rude awakening after so many years and the loss of his livelihood and dream.Out for some butter for his Mom's famous tuna melts, Jimmy runs into a high school classmate who is and was quite a butt-head who is now married to Jimmy's first love, Nikki. Jimmy and Nikki wind up back in his boyhood room which is untouched by time and looks like a ""rock and roll museum"" according to Nikki.Out of his vinyl record collection, Nikki pulls out Ratcity In Blue by, local 70s favorites, the Good Rats and they listen to a couple of tracks. This brings back memories of seeing the band every Saturday night with their friend Steph - who passed away unbeknownst to Jimmy.This movie is about real people, with lots of issues, who love music and are dealing with some very real problems. If you enjoy music, have been on the road with a band or thought about doing so (one of my life's regrets is turning down an offer to be a roadie) you will really like this movie.Full disclosure - I also own this ""original"" album with the cool pizza sleeve art, am a huge Good Rats fan and may have seen Steph, Nikki and Jimmy at one of those Saturday night shows back in the day.

As a casual sci-fi fan, I have to say that I get excited when good sci-fi comes around. I first heard about Serenity 4 or 5 months ago when I saw the teaser trailer, and from then on, I was intrigued. I managed to get my hands on the Firefly episodes, and I watched each one of them, simply in awe of the world that was created, but more specifically the characters. I've seen Serenity twice now. I have not stopped thinking about it since. Its the best kind of film experience...one that hits you emotionally, and yet entertains you at the same time. Having been a Firefly fan, I do have a little bit of a bias, and certainly many of the character moments were much more impacting, simply because of my previous knowledge, but don't let this stop you from seeing this amazing piece of sci-fi. Joss Whedon has done something fantastic by not letting special effects cloud the story. Story and characters are top notch, taking well known clichés, but making them unusual despite that fact. The action is intense and unrelenting, with hardly a moment to breathe in the films climactic moments. The film deserves a 10 out of 10 because of its daring, and its success on almost all fronts. Its not a perfect film, don't get me wrong, but it is leaps and bounds above anything else this genre has produced in the past 20 or so years. It deserves high marks, simply for its gumption.

First, the crap part. It's pretty obvious in watching this that the screenplay is junk the director doesn't know how to direct actors at all, and as a result the acting is terrible too. It brings new meaning to the word ""trite."" There are a few scenes that look good on the screen, such as the part with the Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball and the like. Never mind that there probably weren't many kids playing baseball first thing in the morning on Sunday, but whatever, the image was at least striking. I'll give it that. It can't really make up for the junky love story, however.

Now, why I use the word shameful. This isn't some fictional event, it was an actual event in relatively recent history (in the grand scheme of things) in which quite a few people actually died. Not only that, but it started in motion a chain of events that was very serious, resulted in a tremendous amount of sacrifice, and should be treated with at least some respect. It deserves better than a crap-o treatment by Michael Bay, the king of schlocky movies.

182,2563551,2013-11-22,chaos-rampant,Silent Light (2007),,"I urge readers to watch this. The story is touching and human. A family man who is seized by a new inexplicable love that tells him the old love, what he used to think as love, was merely peace and habit, and yet he can't be sure. Is the new one merely passion? Does he have a right to betray the trust? Deny himself happiness? It is the most profoundly troubling question that I imagine can arise in a lifetime.The film is merely one possible outcome, how making a choice can upset the whole universe, the question itself is much more difficult and deep. If you're 18 the gravity of it might not register, you still have second and third chances ahead of you. But after a certain age, I imagine it becomes entirely cosmic, entirely about choosing the last person you're going to know and love. My only quibble about this is the stifled Germanic presence all through the film. I'm talking about the deliberately inexpressive faces, pauses and careful poses, people arranged in symmetries around objects, none of which is artful in my world. Well art can be anything so it is not that so much as choosing the world you're going to live in and I'll have none of that stylized pouting in my home, suffering can never be an aesthetic.Yet in this hard shell there is a softly pounding heart of beauty.One is how this harsh German presence is softened by the afterglow of a sweeter sun and rolling Mexican landscape, which is where the film takes place. Mellowed in this way it brings to the fore a quality I admire in Protestants: simple lives, joy in austerity and nonattachment. Though it came from historical necessity, it's still the closest thing to Zen we've known in Europe.The other thing is even simpler yet that much more beautiful. The film is shot in long quiet sweeps of ordinary nothing, those who keep in touch know I am frequently vexed by this technique because it so often becomes merely about style instead of sculpted insight, a garment worn a certain way. Transcendent vision in film, which is at its most powerful, is about unconcealing a fuller sense of world, broader horizons. It cannot be a proclamation of love but a gesture that embodies what it means to; words are just too easy and cheap, whereas the visible action is itself the commitment.Here we have something that is elegant and simple in just the right measure.In the story we have new love that extends from the old, a new feeling, new beginnings one after the other, not always the one desired or anticipated. All through the film we have a dozen or so subtle metaphors about just this feeling of unconcealing a new world, of reaching an end which is only the start of the next landscape.My favorite are the following two. A combine threshes a wheatfield, a violent, clustered image of uprooting, only to arrive at the end of the field at an open horizon of fields. And even greater, during the river scene, the man and soon-to-be betrayed wife embrace as their children wash below, still close, their bodies leave the frame and we're left for several lingering moments in the hazy unfocused space of their absence, only for the camera to slowly find and focus on a blossoming flower.Breathtaking!So when she departs in the end and miraculously comes to again, it the same inner blossom from nothing, call it a sense of the mother still being in the world. The world does not end so long as we keep this anticipation of presence, fields to see after this one, new people to love, never bogged down by loss. The hazy landscape of seeming nothingness already contains the flower, in that scene it is neither there as we don't see it nor not there as it is there to be found, and this all has its meditative sense. I'm glad for this film. From now on, whenever it happens that I have to try and illustrate the Buddhist notion of emptiness, or shunyata, I will reach for this one scene.Something to meditate upon.",696,0,,0,"No reference.

The film opens with her in a doctor's office obviously receiving the most dreaded of news. The camera remains on her face. There is no dialogue, only her last moment gasp before we move to the opening credits.Anna Camp (""True Blood"") stars as Anna, diagnosed with terminal cancer. She has explored every possible treatment, including those in the experimental stage. Since none are an option for her, she has decided to move back to Oregon, where death with dignity is an option. She shows up unannounced on the front porch of her younger brother Michael's (Steven Strait) house. The two haven't seen each other in many years - not since their father kicked her out for being a lesbian. The father is now deceased and his ashes are in a file box in Michael's spare room.The once close siblings re-connect quickly as the pain of the past is released. They laugh, reminisce and get caught up. Michael works in IT, and Anna is an established artist in Salt Lake City, where she's a homeowner with her partner Luisa (Kristin Taylor). Over the course of a few days, Anna meets Michael's girlfriend Shonda (Chloe Mason), and his neighbor Gary (Joe Lo Truglio, ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine""). Gary has Asperger's, plus a few other afflictions, and often pops in for a scoop of Michael's sugar.Anna is not prepared for Michael's backlash to her decision, and that leads to heartfelt conversation, as well as an initially defensive Luisa when she arrives. It's touching to see how Shonda and Gary react, and to see Michael's emotional evolution. Of course, he doesn't want to lose his beloved sister - the one he's only just reconnected with. We can all relate to his feelings. But as Anna says, it's her decision and she would rather go out on her own terms, than in a cold hospital with tubes sticking out.This is the directorial debut and first screenplay from Tim True, who shares ties to Oregon with his co-writer Csaba Mera. Of course this is a tough and controversial topic. We witness Anna's labored breathing and the other effects of late stage cancer, and the heaviness is offset a bit thanks to Gary's t-shirts and coffee mugs. An alternative title to the film could be 'the long goodbye', but Anna's farewell is handled very well by the actors and filmmakers. Anna recites a poem (from Mary Lee Hall) with the line, ""Turn again to life, and smile"", and we realize she's made the decision that's right for her.

The script has so many obvious mistakes while the plot is completely stupid and full of holes, not to mention that the acting is so awkward, it feels like it's all just a bunch of friends playing sharades. Oh and the CGI is just hillarious. The effects in the very first SG-1 episodes were 99x better than this trash; the wormhole itself looks like Winamp visualisations. Giant shark vs Megacrocosaurus makes this look like a cartoon.This is the end of Stargate for good. After this failure, no other studio on the planet will ever entertain the idea to make another SG.

187,3128824,2016-08-14,AlsExGal,Ghost (1990),9.0,"I have to admit that Demi Moore as artist Molly and Patrick Swayze as Sam, an investment banker, had great chemistry. This was extremely popular when it came out in 1990, even winning an academy award for Whoopi Goldberg, whose career had been on a downturn up to that point.

Sam and Molly have a great life in New York City. She is an up and coming artist, he is doing well at his investment banking job. They turn part of a run down building into a yuppie paradise loft apartment. But Sam has a problem expressing his love verbally. And then Sam and Molly are mugged by a common street criminal one night while walking home. Sam is shot and killed while defending Molly, and suddenly finds himself outside of his own body. Nobody can hear him. Nobody can see him. But he can converse with other ""ghosts"" that he finds. He hangs out in his old apartment to be near Molly, and then something happens that makes him think his murder was not a coincidence. The guy who killed him lets himself into his apartment with a key and begins looking for something in particular. He is obviously not there to steal the television. And from there the murder mystery begins.

I still salute this movie for one inventive turn - the most unlikely protagonist ally in film history - Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic who turns out to be the only person who can hear Sam. She is rude, crude, at times greedy, somewhat racist and very mouthy and with a rap sheet a mile long for bunco artistry. But she does end up helping Sam, although he spends all night at her bedside singing ""I'm Henry VIII I am"" to get her to cooperate. However, you will like her, in part because she is so real and believable.

The philosophical questions I mentioned? I guess the biggest question raised is who is a ""good"" person worthy of heaven and who is a ""bad"" person worthy of hell? Are there mitigating circumstances? The film has both of Sam's murderers going to hell. Were they BOTH that bad? One of the killers seemed like he might have been a good person until greed tempted him to the point that he got in over his head for some quick money. He was like Fred C. Dobbs in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" without the gold mine and the endless Mexican desert. And what about Sam? He kills two people , at first attacking them to defend others - and it has got to be scary being chased and beat up by something you can't see - but he seems to have fun scaring them to the point of frenzy. I mean, what did he think was going to happen in each case? Yet he seems surprised when they end up dead at his hands in what could be considered self defense taken to the point of revenge. Yet he goes to heaven. Maybe the scale of eternal reward doesn't weigh acts performed after death? Ponderous.

Neither the title of the film or the cover of the DVD provide any evidence to the contrary. But both the title and artwork are misleading however. Surprisingly given the subject matter the actual story is a subtle and complex study of the relationships between the three main characters in the film, each one caught up, often reluctantly in the world of the Krays.The story deals with true events surrounding the escape of Krays associate Frank Mitchell from Dartmoor prison in December 1966. The Krays mastermind the escape, then hide Frank and his minder John in a London flat. Later they provide him with a female escortThe screenplay was adapted by Gill Adams from her original award winning stage play 'Jump to Cow Heaven' and though extended and altered it shares the emotional impact of the theatrical version. Frank Mitchell, John and Lisa are not the stock characters commonly portrayed in this genre. Perhaps surprisingly the film is as much a love story as it is a portrayal of gangland life.The three principal actors all give excellent performances. The role of escaped convict Frank Michell played by Diarmaid Murtagh is a particularly difficult one, as he is often an annoying and sometimes violent presence, who is at times difficult to empathise with. But by the end of the film we have a very different impression of him. He like John, his minder and Lisa his escort are victims and prisoners caught up in the orbit of the Krays. Morgan Watkins brings great warmth and subtlety to a world weary John. However I think the outstanding performance in the film belongs to Elen Rhys as the escort brought in to entertain and pacify Frank. Though outwardly confident her vulnerability is also evident and both aspects of her personality are skilfully and convincingly presented.First time director Will Kerley, known best previously for his work in opera also directed the original stage play and his familiarity with the characters ensures
that the nuances in their personalities and their developing relationships are well handled.The Krays themselves are minor characters in the story, though their uneasy and ultimately malign presence are constantly apparent. The tension builds as it
becomes clear that Frank's dreams of a pardon freedom look unlikely to be
fulfilled and we have sympathy for his predicament, that of John and particularly the frightened Lisa. An emotionally rich and carefully crafted film.",433,0,,0,"No reference.

His therapist is an abrasive loose cannon, who has methods that are unorthodox to say the least. Considering Dave's lonely life, meeting Buddy Rydell might be a blessing in disguise for him. I originally saw this in theaters and remember being highly amused by this movie. I didn't remember much about it...and decided to re-watch it. I enjoy Sandler's older movies when he actually cared about making people laugh. I wouldn't call this movie the perfect comedy by any means, but there are definitely some laugh out loud moments to be had. It's a little sad to see Nicholson stoop to these antics, but I'm not ashamed to admit that he was hilarious. He works well with Sandler and steals many of the scenes.

198,2672324,2014-06-02,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Universal Soldier: The Return (1999),2.0,"After Roland Emmerich's Universal Soldier (1992), the series was capitalized on its success by producing sequels to it that were released on TV. However, these ""sequels"" as they were called, were received poorly due to fans' lack of interest and a far less entertaining cast. Then 1999 rolled around and Universal Soldier fans were surprised to see this come to their TV informing them trailer style that Van Damme was returning. It's curious to say what the title to this actual sequel just meant ""the return"" of. Was it the return of Jean-Claude Van Damme as Luc Deveraux? Or was it that the plot to this installment revolved around Deveraux returning to a similar station where Unisols were created just like him? Maybe it wasn't even that deep. Perhaps the producers just meant it was the return from the TV productions back into actual theatrically released movies. No one will know and probably not many will care either because this installment barely qualifies as a sequel.

The reason why it is difficult for this movie to be called a sequel to the 1992 original is because of how flimsy the writing connects to its predecessor. After the 1992 film, there wasn't anybody left working on the Unisol project. Everyone except Deveraux had died because of how badly the project turned out to be. Yet, here we are (with no perception of how much time has passed between both films), Deveraux is now one of the leads of operation at a new Unisol factory. Apparently he acquired his humanity back from two meaningless scientists that have very little importance later on in the film. During a regular day, the main computer system (S.E.T.H. - voiced by Michael Jai White) becomes self-aware and decides that it's time he takes control. So who exactly approved the Unisol program? Plus, all the scientists were dead. Who knew how to regenerate more dead soldiers? It was a tiny select group of people.

But this is the least of the problems. First of all, why is Deveraux assisting in the creation of more Unisols? What's his motivation behind this? What possible benefit could he have from this if he knows exactly what could go wrong? It doesn't make any sense. There's even a scene where Deveraux has a flashback to his death and the kind of treatment he was given when he was a Unisol. This almost hints at that Deveraux isn't passed his own stress, but it's never visited again. Deveraux even has a daughter named Hillary who he named after his wife of the same name - wait what? In the 1992 movie, the nosey news reporter was named Veronica and most fans can safely agree that it looked like the future couple was going to be Deveraux and Veronica. Where did this Hillary girl come in? Even more insulting is how obvious and obligatory it becomes when Deveraux comes in contact with another thickheaded female reporter, guess where that goes.

These issues alone amount to a very confusing, poorly written main character that feels like a totally different person. Forget trying to even understand anyone else that's brought in because his or her development is given far less attention. The villain played by Michael Jai White brings up multiple questions as well. Just because a computer system becomes self-aware does not mean it all of sudden knows how to perform martial arts. S.E.T.H.'s motivations are also unexplained besides him wanting to rid the world of chaos. I assume this was apart of the fad for 1999 - making all computers self aware and ready to massacre mankind. Then there's Bill Goldberg as the skull-smashing wrestler turned Unisol. The only thing audiences will know about him is that he hates Deveraux. Why - no will know because it's never explained. What's the point of creating a personality if there's nothing to back it up? I enjoyed him more as the silent type in Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003).

William Malone and John Fasano are the writers behind this. Fasano was probably the man behind all the parts to the film that tried to recollect on what made the original as good as it could be. For all that, it seems like Malone's parts were favored more, which is what made this story so inconsistent. Malone is also the director behind the illogical Creature (1985) film. Just horrendously bad. What's even stranger is that these two writers tried to incorporate comedic lines that are as subtle as the ones of the first. For example, going back to Goldberg, he would be flattened by something and say ""I hate that guy"" in a cartoony way. What made the first movie funny at times was that of how deadpan it was delivered. Here, it just sounds silly.

Mic Rodgers whose real profession is in stunt coordination directed the film. It's also very obvious because this movie contains a lot of action scenes involving stunts so it fits that this would be what he focuses on most. However, this doesn't fix anything. The action is generic and again, cartoonish at times. It's mindless action - nothing complex. Surprisingly for 1999, there aren't many special effects either. Cinematography isn't great either because very little of this movie takes places outside a building, and if it is, it's in the dark. Lastly, Don Davis' score has some quality to it but again, it's nothing that's really memorable considering several times hardcore metal is put in from time to time. Metal is fine but it has to be used in the right manner. This wasn't it and Davis isn't a newbie at composing. He scored the Matrix trilogy!

It's practically nothing like the 1992 original. For a title that supposed to signify the return of greatness - the return is far less than even minimally acceptable.

I was waiting to see if the car rental lady was going to end up in that Formula One race, that would be hilarious. They only issued a yellow flag for that scene with non-racers on the track, so realistic!The music score was extremely annoying and sounded so much like Beverly Hills Cop I was rather 'shocked' to find the song list contained primarily nobodies.The train scene with the non-stop shotgun/rifle/? was very funny for one minute but 10, I almost turned this film off. I was piqued by the size of the famed supercharger and determined you might decrease power with that thing in the way.High recommend to watch and then read the comments here and also to see Leno try to act with very limited results.

I saw the trailer the other day and was pretty impressed, so I was keen to see the movie. However in the end I feel The Conjuring lacked something. There weren't many scary scenes, even though they were sophisticated. Still, you'll be able to find some scenes when you think ""Really???"". I liked the actors, especially Patrick Wilson's character who looked very reassuring throughout the movie and actually put some confidence in scary scenes. There are some jokes, some ""cool"" scenes, i.e. when they are installing gadgets in the house and some our generation energetic electronic plays in the background. I think they should have concentrated a bit more on a horror part, because especially in the second part of the movie it becomes more like an action/adventure.

He and his friend, Pete, make a bet with Dino, whomever wins, gets the whole profit of 2 million dollar car they sold. But, just as Tobey is about to win something goes wrong, and the next thing he knows, he's in jail and Dino gets away.Once Tobey gets out, he encounters the car buyer, Julia, and they are off to California to enter a race in which the winner gets to keep all the cars, which total millions. And it takes a long time before the film ever gets to the big race. I guess the whole car getting lifted by a helicopter was probably the best part.Some things just didn't make sense. Why did Tobey do all the illegal driving when heading off to California? If he would have driven normally, the cops wouldn't have been after him. And for the big race, what is the point in winning all the cars, if all of them are totaled except one. Also, why did they have the finish line in a place where the winner is going to get caught. And come on, in the movie Tobey goes back at the end for Dino, that was out of character considering what Dino did.FINAL VERDICT: If you like fast cars, you'll like it.

217,2599808,2014-01-25,TheLittleSongbird,Valentino (1977),7.0,"Once you realise and accept(if you can) that what is depicted in Valentino is far from what really happened then you will find a lot of enjoyment here. Ken Russell has done better with Women in Love, The Devils and The Music Lovers(also his even better composer documentaries, apart from the Richard Strauss one), it is though certainly more watchable than Lisztomania. The storytelling, told in flashback structure, is jumpy in places which makes it not always easy to follow and I agree that the characters are written flatly, they're very well played but you wish that you learnt more about them. Plus Rudolph Nureyev is a very mixed bag in the title role, he is an incredible dancer(in ballet one of the greats, his chemistry with Margot Fonteyn perhaps unparallelled) and it shows in the beautifully choreographed dance routines, the tango especially, he was also a very handsome man, his chemistry with his colleagues credible and does show some expressive acting in the dances. His dialogue delivery is another story, often very awkward-sounding and at times incomprehensible, and while charismatic and athletic his acting outside the dance routines was at times too subtle and not matching with the acting style of films from the first twenty years of the 20th century. Leslie Caron however looks as though she was having a whale of a time and is gleefully enjoyable, while Michelle Phillips is more restrained and is touching and delightful. Felicity Kendall is also very involved and Carol Kane and Seymour Cassell delight. Ken Russell writes himself in and is thankfully nowhere near as embarrassingly bad as he was in Salome's Last Dance. The music is fitting, it captures the period beautifully and is used in a way that enhances the atmosphere yet accommodates the more dramatic elements. Visually Valentino is a gorgeous film to look at, one of Russell's most visually pleasing films. The sets and colours are lavish and the costumes, hair-styles and make-up are unmistakably 20s. The dance scenes show off Nureyev's talents really well and are intoxicating, while the sexual moments are mostly sexual but sometimes gratuitous. The script is appropriately dark-humoured and sharply biting, you cannot resist how Valentino's conflicts with different people(mainly moguls hungry for power and actresses) are depicted, even if it doesn't say a lot about the characters. Russell like his actors seems to be really enjoying himself, the film is full of his style which goes to go how much the direction shines. And thankfully his stylistic touches while not exactly restrained are not overly-excessive or distasteful, Caron's entrance at the funeral is eye-poppingly operatic, while Valentino's jail encounter, the fight sequence and the staging of the funeral are every bit as entertaining and grandly staged, managing to do so in a way that is not too overblown. In conclusion, not for people expecting a history lesson(and that is not meant to sound derogatory if it does come across that way, more as a forewarning as to what to expect) but for a well-made film that does spark at least an ounce of interest Valentino is worth a viewing. 7/10 Bethany Cox",522,0,,0,"No reference.

During their evening, a heated debate about their relationship is ignited.While Céline calls Jesse's fidelity into question, he challenges her parenting skills, which results in her doubting their love.With its relevant stance on relationship qualms, this second sequel to Before Sunrise serves as an endearing and worthy bookend to the dialogue heavy trilogy that began in 1995.Luckily, thanks to Greece's recession, you can easily get out of the doghouse by buying your wife the Parthenon.

I think what makes the show so engaging is the fact that we have this guy, Dexter, who we become so emotionally and heroically attached to, and we are given a sense and feeling that we want him to prevail and we don't want him to ever be caught or found out who he really is, yet at the same time we sometimes question and doubt the actions that Dexter takes. I believe we as the audience would also find so many similarities in Dexter and his everyday life and at the same time we ask ourselves why Dexter is the way he is, which is another factor as to why he becomes such a successful protagonist.Overall this is a fantastic and thoroughly engaging and addictive TV show, that at times will leave you shocked, disgusted then at other times will leave you happy and relieved for our protagonist, among many other emotions.",217,0,,0,"No reference.

My favorite scene is when the family and Mr.Barrie are flying with the Kite. When Michael gets the Kite up in the air is a magical moment, I always gets tears in my eyes. Maybe it is because you know that he will get it up or the music.

Talking about the music...I love soundtracks, all kinds. Kaczmarek is my new hero of film composers. I give you as an advise to listen to the music in this film.

Metaphor: Darren went to the great soda fountain of metaphor and Biblical allegory and he made what some call a ""Suicide"", just a shot of every possible sugary beverage possible, and some cheap booze in a similar varietal. Likely an 8-ball of cocaine to make it seem like a good idea. Then he drank it down quickly (""I wrote the script in just 5 days"" Darren splendors - Oh Really? And I presume you're beyond editorial support at this point in your artistic pinnacle?). He then took his current real-life girlfriend, Jennifer Lawrence, (Jen. Run. You're better than this.) and he strapped some electrodes to her for shock value, and he peed all over her and filmed it using only three shots for some film-school-senior-project level fancy: close up, from behind, and point of view. Then he praised himself for making a film that is 'really about how we are treating mother earth'. Yeah. He did that. And he thinks he's smarter than you. I am not sure if there is enough cocaine in Hollywood to explain the amount of ego masturbation that this film portrays. The whole not-too-subtle story of Artist as God who abuses his muse and is obsessed with praise is heavy handed. You're not a God, Darren. Your art is pretentious tripe, much like the intestines of the baby on the sacrificial table. The real kick in the labia is the utter misogyny of the film, produced by a group of ONLY males (6 producers, editor, cinematographer, etc, plus the Douche). So, a penis parade made a nightmarish film about motherhood and society's dismissal of the feminine and weren't smart enough to see the irony in not having a single woman above-the-line on the production?

I have enjoyed the first series, but like most was let down by TPM. I went into AOTC with few expectations, and was more than pleasantly surprised. The action was swift, easy to follow, and there were enough silly one-liners. The effects in the fight and action scenes were superb, although were occasionally poor in the dialogue sections. The acting was highly appropriate - just over the top enough to fit in well with the rest. As a Kiwi, it was a bit odd seeing Jay Lagai'a (sp?) and Temuera Morrison on the big screen, still looking and sounding like kiwis, but they acquited themselves well.All in all - an enjoyable 2 1/2 hrs, although the dialogue in some areas was worse than weak, and occasionally the film felt a little too ""knowing"" about what was to come (in IV, V and VI).",161,0,,0,"No reference.

235,2336897,2012-08-23,AudioFileZ,Safe (I) (2012),6.0,"This movie is about rival international gangs and a young girl who is a number wunderkind. But, we really know before hand it's about Jason Statham disposing of ""bad guys"". After a slow-ish beginning to setup the Chinese, Russians, and bad cops - and how the little Chinese girl and Statham relate to their Chinatown fiefdom - violence occurs at an extremely fast pace; one could almost call it ""violence porn"" taking into count the visual quantity which, thankfully, spares some of the all too common graphicness. Somehow, the bit of humanity wrapped up in the girl buffers it just the smallest bit as it becomes Stratham's noble vendetta. Statham's fall and rise hinges on this new purpose: to save the little girl. He takes it serious and fights out of the corruption while taking no prisoners.Seen as an action vehicle for Statham this movie fairs a bit better than average as after the slow beginning it moves fast and with masterful fight scenes and a decent enough story. The character of Mei, played by newcomer Catherine Chan, is the standout here: she's a cool professional delivering nuance beyond her age. It's complimented by the usual, but well-casted cops/international bad guy plethora of characters anchored by the steely cold Robert John Burke. Of course, front and center is Statham and he's complicated so as you root for him you still have a sense of dread knowing his character is on the precipice of being beyond redemption due to his circumstances. In other words...A character for Statham with some meat on the bones which he delivers.If you like action it's here and that is the bottom line. A Statham movie where he does his sch-tick well building to a crescendo that is satisfying. There isn't great depth, however, and that is what keeps the movie from rating higher. It's action entertainment that is over-the-top, but doesn't fall apart if you park some of the right-brain matter. I must say that in the times we're now in it becomes harder to appreciate a movie purely based on violent action, but as mentioned earlier in spite of the quantity the graphic level of it isn't pandered.

They suspect businessman Max Zorin of selling details to them.  When Bond is sent to investigate he finds that Zorin is not only stockpiling silicon but also drilling near the San Andreas fault.  Bond begins to suspect that Zorin does more than just sell secrets.Bond once had a cruel rough edge here that is all but gone with Moore's eye-brow raising technique.  The plot here is of some interest but really it doesn't convince.  The lack of real tension or action takes a lot away from this film and, although it has it's moments, it is really very poor by the high standards of Bond.  However fans of Bond may well like it all the same  I still enjoyed it although I felt that it could have been better.Moore is looking old  his was his last Bond.  He looks too old for this type of thing and it means he's like an aging camp icon in a spy spoof rather than the great Bond as we know him.  Walken is a good bad guy  in other filmshere his natural sinister air gives way to a wildly eccentric villain.  He really should have done what he usually does.  Grace Jones is no Bond girl and really isn't used well.  People like Patrick Macnee and the usual cast add class but really it's only window dressing on a messy film.As with all Bonds this has plenty of nice touches but really this lacks the style and the flair that made the other ones work.

239,2772754,2014-12-06,Likes_Ninjas90,出埃及記：天地王者 (2014),4.0,"Ridley Scott's Exodus: Gods and Kings is a grandly staged but soulless and mediocre retelling of Moses liberating the slaves of Egypt. It is one of two Bible films released in 2014, following Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which envisioned a corrupt world cleansed of evil by a violent God and where a single man was enlisted to salvage a group of people. This description is applicable to Exodus given the over familiarity of its plotting and characters. The return of these Biblical epics is not only because Hollywood is heavily influenced by Christian values and religious groups in the industry. The popularisation of epics in the vein of Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments and William Wyler's Ben Hur is also political. Currently, violence and extremism are perpetuated by radical fundamentalists misinterpreting religion. Bible stories are as current as they are ancient, relaying the Old Testament's brutality and reflecting perpetually violent attitudes of modern extremists.While Aronofsky's film gambled on bleak, moody stylisation, Exodus' treatment is safe and unsurprising, adhering to a fault to past filmmaking traditions. Prior to the film's release, an online boycott was launched, attacking the decision to cast White actors in major roles of Middle Eastern characters. White imitation, where Anglo- Saxon actors impersonate ethnic roles, is an unproud, archaic Hollywood practice. Ridley Scott defended the casting in a Variety interview: ""I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain, and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such."" His insensitivity doesn't account for how White actors today would be forbidden from playing a Black character, particularly in America. Similarly, given Hollywood's oversaturated marketing budgets, would it be too difficult to sell the film on Scott's name alone or introduce new actors to the world?Casting recognisable stars detracts sharply from the film's period rendering. Featuring Englishmen Christian Bale and Ben Kingsley, Americans Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro and Aaron Paul and Australians Ben Mendelsohn and Joel Edgerton, there's a wave of familiar faces and accents jarring with the setting and typifying the film's homogenisation. Rarely does an image, a line of dialogue, or character feel unique to the film either. The opening quarter particularly mimics Scott's Gladiator too closely. Moses (Bale) is a more skillful warrior and tactician than his half brother Ramses (Edgerton). He saves Ramses life in an early battle scene and Ramses' father Seti (John Turturro) seems to favour him more even though he is adopted and unlikely to become the next Pharaoh. After investigating the thieving shonky practices of Hegep (Mendelsohn), Moses's true Hebrew heritage is explained to him by Nun (Ben Kingsley). Hegep reveals this to Ramses, who forces Moses into exile. Moses starts a family of his own in a village, with a wife and son. After hitting his head he is plagued by visions of God inhabiting the body of a young boy (Isaac Andrews), who encourages him to free the Hebrews from enslavement. His fate of being exiled, his goal and motives are highly similar to Maximus.Bale's inclusion accentuates the derivativeness of the archetype. Instead of a cape and a mask, Moses wields a gold sword. But like Bruce Wayne, Moses's arc is typical of Hollywood characters searching for individualism. He predictably transitions from denying his legacy to liberating his people and reuniting himself with his family. The script rewritten by Steve Zaillian from Bill Collage and Adam Cooper's drafts takes Moses through unnecessary detours. Ramses only considers killing Moses long after he's exiled and a training montage where Moses teaches soldiers to fight is wasted when God unleashes the plagues instead. Moses becomes displaced from the story, except for a tangent where he disapproves of God's methods of justice. The plagues of Egypt are admittedly disturbing and visceral, but the literal interpretation diminishes possibilities of Moses imagining God. One unsettling dramatic touch is cutting to Ramses' family life before the plagues, which builds tension knowing his son's fate. But Ramses isn't a juicy villain but a weak symbol of hubris. Joel Edgerton doesn't have a firm grasp on what angle to take, meaning we don't entirely feel the emotion of his blindness and rage.Once Exodus escapes its stifled first half, the rest of narrative from the plagues onwards is overly familiar, bloody and brutal and supplies the actors with predictable, punchline dialogue spoken in plain English. There was a chance here to touch upon refugees escaping war and enslavement. These are issues dramatised only through the rhythms of action set pieces. While Scott's Robin Hood cut a new origin story into an old tale and reinvented the characters, there are fewer surprises about how this film develops because of how risk-averse it is with the narrative and the casting. While the scale of the film is huge and cinematic, it's the finer attention to detail in the screenplay and the period which feel lacking. Imagination and distinction are not qualities one would expect missing from the director who made Alien and Blade Runner. But in his twilight year Ridley Scott is determined largely to make epics of numbers rather than people.",852,0,,0,"No reference.

241,880959,2005-01-08,bzzzbee,The Incredibles (2004),,"You see the trailers, view the making of special and it still delivers?! What a terrific movie and a rarity these days, unless it is a Pixar initiative. While it seems to borrow the dual identity premise of Spy Kids (2001), the large variety of wacky superheroes like Mystery Men (1999), the reworked superpowers of The Fantastic Four, the excitement and energy of the best James Bond movies and the character fallibilities of Spider-man 2 (2004) it is largely a unique movie in its own right.It is fundamentally an action movie but what sets Pixar movies apart, from not only other animated but standard flicks, is the humanity it imparts. There are elements similar to the Iron Giant (1999), also directed by Mr Bird, that are very touching. The characters have depth and by the end of it most viewers will have something they can take away from the experience. A bit like an Aesop's fable using outstanding animation.This isn't a by-the-numbers movie where the film-makers left all their great work on a white board. These people obviously care deeply about the project, the story and the characters. This makes it easy for the viewer to feel compassion and sympathy for 'The Incredibles' and strongly dislike the villain. While the animated special effects are, dare I say it, INCREDIBLE, this movie has heart and any effects used have a purpose that enhances the story.There is also a great sense of comedy. Some of the scenes featuring the parents in various situations had me laughing out loud. Like all the other Pixar movies there is plenty of fun for the adults. Not so many in-jokes as the Toy Story movies as this movie stands strongly by itself with its own style. Mr Incredible's ever increasing paunch is something I can really relate to. Whatever happened to the glory days when I could feel my ribs! I'm going to see this again. The movie reinforces the importance of family, to treat others as you'd treat yourself and don't take life for granted. In times of war and crippling natural disasters these messages couldn't come at a better time. Yet it avoids preaching to the audience and being overly overt in delivering its messages.It is perfect for parents who want to do something entertaining with their kids or for people like me in their early-30s who appreciate good film making, a nice chocolate ice-cream/box of popcorn and laughing together with complete strangers.",409,0,,0,"No reference.

Ames is a sleazy music producer, who goes on about his constant affairs with several other women despite his wife's knowledge of it happening and the fact he also has kids as well. Ames is driving on a dark and stormy night and it is hinted that a insane woman has escaped the local mental hospital. He ventures out to a cabin in the woods that he owns only to find a mysterious woman named Cathy there naked covered in a sheet, trying to escape the storm. She is an aspiring actress and as his usual perv self he asks her to stay for the night till the storm passes. Strangely Cathy begins to seduce him and they both have sex. However, he then hears the radio broadcast again about the escaped woman who has a tendency to cut her lovers throats with kitchen knives, and her description fits Cathy's perfectly, but, is she really the killer?. This is a really fun episode that's what you'd come to expect from a series like this. You have some great nudity, a little bit of softcore sex (both courtesy of HBO) and a fun game of cat and mouse between the two protagonists. The only thing is that you can probably see how the ending is going if you've ever watched shows like this before, but, it doesn't ruin the fun of it. August Schellenberg plays the sleazy womanizer perfectly and the little known Pamela Bowman who seems to have had just a short 8 year or so stretch in mostly guest television roles, does decent and defiantly has no problem in showing skin.

I didn't see it on original release, because I happen to be somewhat fascinated by the Ed Gein story and have read up on it, and I was afraid the film would be a B-movie exploitation of one of the most bizarre episodes in the history of American crime. Gee, I wish it were.This film is really a pretty mediocre docu-drama that attempts to explain away the more disturbing aspects of the Gein story with cheap and easy Freudian references, down to having Gein see and listen to his dead mother urge him on to do ""God's work"" by ""punishing"" wicked women for their sexuality.Unfortunately, this explanation doesn't tell us anything at all about Gein's cannibalism, nor about his almost childish fascination for body parts. In one scene in a bar, Gein suddenly asks the other customers whether any of them know about sex-change operations. I take it this was cut into the movie to explain Gein's efforts to wear the skin of some of his victims, and certainly the real Gein was interested in the issue. What gets lost here is all the rich sense of transformation that might go into a sick fascination for donning the skin of another human being. This isn't simply changing one's sex - this is becoming something other than human.One other point - as a Freudian explanation, the film has Gein denying responsibility for his murders - either he can't remember them, or it was ""mom's fault"". Wait a minute - could Gein have just ignored all those body parts cluttering up his house? Obviously not; in fact the real Gein was aware of what he was doing - he just didn't think there was anything wrong with it. The only reason we know parts of his story is because he was able to give detailed descriptions of what he did. He approached murder, dismemberment, and cannibalism with a clinical disinterest in any of the moral implications of these acts. It was simply Gein's way of living in the world.Now that is truly frightening. The terrible thing about Gein was that he was utterly bland - he was the guy next door, the quiet neighbor, not very interesting, not much to say.Few films have managed to capture this quality about any serial killer.

Sam (Chris Pine) returns home when his father dies, returning home we see that Sam did not get on well with his deceased father. Meeting with his dad's lawyer he learns that he has a half-sister that he never knew he had. When he meets this women named Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) he takes a while to tell her the truth about him leading to the two of them starting a relationship which is built around lies through Sam.The story is very predictable when such scenes as Frankie falling for Sam only to get super mad at him when learning the truth only at the end to forgive him over the thing they have in common which was a bad dad. Even when some of the scenes are predictable the film does have some great dramatic moments such as many of the scenes shared between Pine and Pfeiffer. Some of the writing was not well written especially some lines that had me confused and they mostly came from the son of Frankie and how most of his dialogue was laughable to me. I believe that the film is based on a true story because I would not know why some person would want to write and original story like this one. The film's cinematography was very bad to me because usually it seemed they used sunlight too much on these actors faces to try make them look more dramatic especially when Pine would look into the distant sometimes, this was not a good use of cinematography at all.Chris Pine plays Sam and shows once again that he is not as good an actor as someone with his fame could be by taking risks. Everyone else around him comes off better mainly because he is just not a dramatic actor and should stick to his action films were he is not called to give a performance but just jump and run. Elizabeth Banks has been great at comedy but in this film as Frankie she gets to show how her dramatic work can be. She has fun in some scenes opposite Pine but sometimes when she is being dramatic she is believable but at other times she could have been better. She is better then Pine because her character does have more of a transformation. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Pine's mother Lillian and she truly is the best thing in her limited scenes with Pine. It's not one of her career best performances but she does such a great job in the film acting very natural and being the most emotional performance in the film that made me tear up sometimes. Also some actors in limited time such as Olivia Wilde are also worth a shout out. The actor playing the kid tried to make this character good but I was just annoyed by the child whenever he said anything.The film is fine with some moments that are laughable even if the film was based off true events. Performances are fine with Michelle Pfeiffer being the standout in performance and in emotions that the film really needed.

A retiring cop,Nicholson swears to the mother of a murdered girl that he will findthe killer. Along the way, he runs into a battered single mom(Robin Wright Penn) whose beautiful child becomes the light ofNicholson's life--and the grain of hope that he may redeemhimself.But...redeem from what? is the question I found myself asking.Unlike the bureaucrat in IKIRU, or Harvey Keitel's Bad Lieutenant,Nicholson's character doesn't particularly seem in need ofabsolution.

279,5328088,2020-10-19,Shala-Shaska,Asphalt Urban GT (2004 Video Game),10.0,"Asphalt: Urban GT is quite obviously a game that was not designed with the DS specifically in mind, and it doesn't try to shoehorn in dual-screen or touch-sensitive elements where they're not necessary. This game is simply a fun little racer, and one of the best-looking DS launch titles to boot.Asphalt looked pretty good when it was released earlier on the N-Gage, but it looks even better on the larger DS screen, and it sports a much, much better frame rate. The bevy of licensed cars featured in the game capture the look of their real-world counterparts quite accurately, even if they do tend to be a little boxy. Along with a downright impressive variety of cars, the game keeps the visuals interesting with tracks set in a great variety of locations. Each track has a unique and well-defined look, and they're all quite good at evoking the feel of the cities they're based on (smart use of shadows and some reflective effects help to further the feeling that you're actually in these environments). The rock-solid frame rate helps create a good sense of speed, which is further accentuated by the camera-rattle effect that accompanies the turbo boost. The draw-in distance is occasionally noticeable, but it's not bad enough that it affects the actual gameplay experience, and you really have to look to see it. All of the actual racing action takes place on the upper screen, and the lower screen primarily shows a course map and the current positions of all the racers. It's not a particularly inventive use of the lower screen, but it's functional, and being able to anticipate long straightaways helps to make the best use of your turbo boosts.Though the game is graphically impressive, its sound leaves much to be desired. Our biggest issue with the sound is that of the actual cars. The effects themselves aren't that bad--the engine sounds good and throaty, with a layer of high-pitch whine at higher speeds, and the tires squeal around corners satisfyingly. But no matter what you're driving, be it an H2 Hummer, a Jaguar XKR, or a classic Morgan roadster, all the cars use exactly the same sound effects, which takes away from the uniqueness that the game otherwise does a pretty good job of imbuing all the cars with. Filling in any gaps in between the blaring car sounds is a rather trite soundtrack of mechanical break beats and by-the-numbers synth sounds.Asphalt aims for a simple, arcade-inspired design ethic, and this is very much apparent in the game's controls, which consist simply of gas, brake, and turbo-boost buttons, and the D pad for steering. The game curiously allows you to extensively remap any single control function--if you want the left shoulder button to act as your right turn control, so be it--but the game's use of the DS touch screen is limited to menu navigation.Taking a page from Criterion's Burnout series, the game allows you to increase the amount of nitrous you have at your disposal by drifting around corners, coming dangerously close to the other traffic on the streets and busting up certain objects on the side of the road, though you're also constantly gaining more turbo boost even when not pulling off such maneuvers. The N-Gage version of Asphalt was a lot more liberal with the boost, starting each race with more boost and filling your boost meter more quickly. That the DS version reins in the amount of boost you're given is a good thing, as it makes the overall game more challenging and requires you to be more thoughtful about when to use your turbo boost. The game has a pretty good sense of speed, and each of its 20-plus licensed cars handles fairly uniquely and appropriately. This occasionally leads to certain cars simply not being much fun to drive, but for the most part it works to the game's advantage.The biggest fault in Asphalt's gameplay is with the collision detection, which is all over the place. The props that you can run into and destroy have no effect on your speed, and there are other objects--such as the palm trees that split part of the course on the Hong Kong track--that you can just pass right through. Collision with other cars is the worst, though. Bumping into other cars that are going in the same direction as you are is stuttery and unnatural looking. The game seems to always give priority to the other car in a collision, which means it's never to your advantage to rub with another racer, as they can easily nudge you off-course as you're drifting around a corner. Running into oncoming traffic causes your car to go into a canned spinout. This can actually occasionally work to your advantage, since you'll sometimes accelerate even more when you're spinning out and you'll usually retain that speed when you reset. Since the game's release on the N-Gage, it feels like Gameloft has cleaned up the collision detection in Asphalt a bit, but it still stands as the weakest link in the otherwise enjoyable gameplay.It's obviously not a simulation, but Asphalt does make a nod to many rally-racing games by flashing the general direction of an upcoming turn moments before you hit it. This provides you with just enough time to position yourself and get ready to start applying the brakes to begin the drift. Asphalt gets a lot of mileage out of this straight-up control scheme with its decent variety of gameplay modes.The arcade mode offers a variety of race types, including instant play, road challenge, free race, time attack, and cop chase. The instant play mode throws you into a random car on a random track in a random gameplay mode, no questions asked. The road challenges are a series of races against artificial intelligence opponents that are divvied up by class, and the free race is similar, though it's just a single race in which you can choose from any of the cars and race on any of the nine tracks in the game. Time attack takes out the other racers and the ambient street traffic, pitting you against the clock.The cop chase mode is kind of like the classic Atari arcade game A.P.B., except in 3D. In a souped-up sports-car-cum-cop-car, your goal is to chase down a number of escaping cars before time runs out. All you have to do is line up behind the perp and keep him within the targeting overlay on your screen for a few seconds, and he'll automatically pull over. It sounds simple enough, but unfortunately the control in Asphalt isn't precise enough and the tracks are often curvy, which makes it exceedingly difficult to keep the cars in your sight long enough to pull them over. It's a good enough idea, but most rounds usually just end in frustration.If you're looking for something a little bit bigger in scope than just a handful of races, the evolution mode gives you a garage and a series of race challenges in which you can win cash and cars. You can also go to car dealers and buy new cars, or buy performance- and aesthetic-based upgrades.The game also features Wi-Fi multiplayer support for up to four players. You can choose a single race--in which you define what tracks you race on and what class of cars you race in--or you can go into the championship mode and select from a variety of race series in which the cars and tracks are already defined. The cop chase mode is also playable over Wi-Fi, though because of its cat-and-mouse mechanics, it's limited to two players. In all, the multiplayer functionality is pretty good, despite having a few quirks. Regardless of which mode you're in, all of the nonracing street traffic is missing. Also, there is no way to limit the classes of cars that players can choose from, giving players who have unlocked more cars a distinct advantage.It doesn't really take great advantage of many of the features that make the DS unique, but Asphalt is still fundamentally an enjoyable arcade-style racer, regardless of the platform. The gameplay is fast and accessible, and there's enough variety in both the single- and multiplayer modes that you could spend a lot of time with the game.",1381,0,,0,"No reference.

The story is not really that hard to figure out but it is among the best in the series, at its core it's a crime thriller with occult/horror overtones, kinda like what you would expect for the X-files, but well...better. The Cenobites present in this film are much better then any found in the Hellraiser series with the possible exception of the original 4, the makeup and CG are well done.Overall I'd give this film an 8, solid story and acting only offset by a brick wall of a lead character. Pinhead is present in all his former glory that would be found in the original film, his lack of screen time in no way reduces the quality of the film in fact it makes it better.",280,0,,0,"No reference.

283,883743,2005-01-12,tinkerbelllcf,Dawn Anna (2005 TV Movie),3.0,"I was very disappointed with Dawn Anna. I have been an avid Columbine researcher for nearly a year or so now and was highly looking forward to this movie. I almost feel horrible saying the movie was bad simply because it was all true events and tragic nonetheless. So, before I begin, I think the story itself is fascinating and inspiring, but it came across weak in this movie.The story is Dawn Anna is a single mother of four terrific kids who is in desperate need of a job. So, in less than ten minutes, she gets one as a teacher. And five minutes from that, she decides to be the volleyball coach after meeting nice guy Bink, who wants to take her out to dinner and in no time, they're an official couple. The kids seem to warm up to him quickly except one, but a sudden turn of events puts that on hold. Dawn Anna discovers (after tumbling around in school and forgetting things easily) that she has some sort of brain tumor and it needs to be removed via opening the skull. So, in the span of fifteen minutes, Dawn is checked by a doctor, a diagnosis is made, she attempts to have it removed one way (which fails), then she has to official surgery and gets it removed.From there, we see that after the surgery, Dawn is unable to speak or walk. So, the kids and Bink (they all like him now) take it as their responsibility to help her. She learns to speak and walk in roughly fifteen more minutes after going through physical therapy and reading flashcards. She's finally allowed to go home and Bink finally proposes to her. Some evening a few days after (or seconds, depending on who's time your on), Dawn is tucking in her daughter Lauren, who up until now wasn't the main focus whatsoever, and we zip up to five years later (1999). Lauren is now the only child still living at home. All of a sudden, Lauren becomes a more interesting character and a larger focal point. We're now about an hour an fifteen minutes into the movie.After a brief subplot of Lauren's sister getting engaged and Lauren having an extremely weird discussion with her mother (which is thrown in there simply to show the relationship between them, I believe), we get to the Columbine story. After Lauren is dropped off at her school, a young man is wearing a Columbine jacket, which is the first we hear about what school officially she attends. A commercial break occurs with police sirens in the fade out. Once we understand what is going on, Dawn rushes home to watch the news stories in bewilderment (these are real news casts from the event as well). The family gathers around and victims advocates come to the house to get information on her daughter. They announce her daughter is a victim on TV the next day and make it official. This all happens in ten minutes. We spend no time worrying for her daughter or seeing the growing panic in the household because we're running out of time. The film ends with the family trying to get back on their feet and Dawn becoming a public speaker on gun control. She ends by going to visit Lauren's grave (which also looks exactly like the real Lauren Townsend's grave up close, so I think it probably is, but the crane shot doesn't look like the real cemetery). The film is dedicated to the lives lost at Columbine even though we barely spend any time thinking about it and we don't even seem to care about Lauren until the film is more than half over.I thought the story was just a jumble of events. They didn't follow any distinct direction except the ""Let's just throw in one bad thing after another to show how this woman can overcome it all."" The character development just wasn't there. I've studied the real Dawn Anna and her daughter, Lauren Townsend, for some time now, and I can say that both were and are remarkable women. Debra Winger is also a terrific actress who is often underrated. I was just disappointed with how both the acting and the story didn't compliment each other. It seems like the movie was under such pressure to stuff everything into just two hours that we didn't have time to even discuss where the real father was, the marriage between Bink and Dawn, or Lauren being an extremely scholarly student (she was named Valedictorian posthumously at her graduation). If this film had been made into a two part series or even a mini series, I think it would have been much more effective and we could have gotten a lot more story-line. Unfortunately, I don't believe Debra Winger's talents were used to their fullest potential and I don't believe the story of Dawn Anna and her daughter was of remote interest the way it was told.",832,0,,0,"No reference.

284,727869,2004-02-12,Chris Knipp,Choses secrètes (2002),,"[S P O I L E R S]Either because they were too shocking, or too bad, or just too French, Jean-Claude Brisseau's previous nine films (some just done for TV) haven't made it to the US. Choses secrètes (Secret Things) is having some limited distribution here. The film seduces initially with its intelligence and its elegant look; then it betrays us with tendentiousness, tedium, and numbing excess.  If you loved Luchino Visconti's The Damned or Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò, you will have to see this.  If you respected Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, you may want to consider Choses secrètes, which some think does its moral consideration of sex and its orgy scenes better.Whereas Dangerous Liaisons (the Choderlos de Laclos classic as well as its various film adaptations) involves the plot of a man and a woman to demolish a powerful and wicked female, this film involves two women out to get men in general. Brisseau's Nathalie (Coralie Revel), a stripper, coaches Sandrine (Sabrina Seyvecou), a barmaid, on how they can both become powerful through exploiting their own sexual daring. They've just been fired - literally thrown out on the street - from the club where they both work for refusing to have sex with customers afterward. Nathalie persuades the naïve, penniless Sandrine to move in with her and next day outlines her plan for the two of them to conquer the Paris business world.This is all to be done through sex, and from scene one, there's plenty of masturbation  -- orgasms, real or faked, come as often as explosions in action flicks -- and plenty of nudity, but only female in each case. Nathalie's simplistic, rather old-fashioned rule is that if they can give themselves pleasure, they need never be enslaved to any man.  The typically French rationality of Nathalie's exposition of her plan undercuts the obvious softcore aspects of the film - for a while, that is.
And so does Choses secrètes' splendid appearance: the beauty of the two young women is set off by handsome cinematography and a generous use of sumptuous, richly colored drapery that makes the décor a pleasure to look at.  One wishes American filmmakers could generate effects of taste and elegance with such simple means.  But there is more to cinema than the visuals and this movie begins to seem little more than a Vogue shoot.Wilder and prettier:  that's the two girls' selling point.  On the strength of a certain provocative appeal, we're to believe, they're hired at a major financial corporation, Nathalie in personnel, Sandrine in the top administrative office. Again the film's seductive:  the sudden rise may be far fetched, but you want to see what happens.Sandrine follows Nathalie's instructions and rejects a younger executive who wants to marry her:  a big mistake; but she sticks to the program. Instead of dating the sincere young man, Sandrine seduces Delacroix, the firm's married, bored fifty-year-old (but handsome and lean) manager.  Delacroix falls hopelessly in love. Sandrine fakes everything.  Nathalie ignores her own rules and has a secret lover who hurts her.  We have to guess who he is; but it's not hard: we know that Christophe (Fabrice Deville), the aged, ill boss's son, who's heir to the corporate fortune, is a gorgeous seducer who's literally driven women to commit suicide right before his eyes - and enjoyed watching.  Christophe has a preposterous back-story to explain his moral emptiness.Things go rapidly downhill when this monster of evil begins to dominate the scene.  It doesn't help that the slightly corpulent Christophe looks more like last year's model than a real person.  Looks and sound effects have started to take over Choses secrètes at this point. There haven't been such scenes of elegant depravity since Visconti.  But there are too many orgies with Bach and Vivaldi masses played at top volume for background. It's over the top: the film self-destructs before one's eyes.  And the old-fashioned moral tale - replete with blatant titillation over the `hell' it depicts - morphs into an increasingly tedious and surreal scenario.  There's an angel of annihilation, a face transfixed by death, a bird of prey pecking at a bleeding chest:  we're on the wilder fringes of the French imagination. Cocteau did this sort of thing much better.In a final scene several years later Nathalie and Sandrine, now on separate paths, have a brief final meeting.  One has a wholesome life and the other has become a pampered princess:  using a stretch limo to suggest the latter's wealth was a genuinely bad idea.  Both women look exactly the same as ever:  like this year's models.  The movie has completely disintegrated. There is nothing left to care about.But I did love the drapery in Nathalie's bedroom.  It promised better things.For an infinitely smarter and ultimately more chic French film about love games, if you don't want to go to the source, de Laclos' Dangerous Liaisons and its film versions, rent a copy of Benoît Jacquot's School of Flesh (L'École de la chair), with  Isabelle Huppert at her most sublimely disdainful.  Nathalie and Sandrine combined aren't fit to dust her shoes.",848,0,,0,"No reference.

286,251261,2001-02-02,chicothekid,Twenty Bucks (1993),7.0,"If you ever decide to doubt the power that one incredible idea can do for a movie, you have desperately got to see this!  Twenty Bucks is one of the most creative ideas ever made into a movie and will definitely earn a few laughs for the writing alone.  While there is no one main character here, the story revolves around a twenty dollar bill.  The movie opens as the money enters circulation, and ends when it is mangled and ready to be burned.  The life of the money is the story of the movie, and it's just delightful!  As it changes hands from one person to the next, it has a profound impact on some people, and no impact on others.  At times, it appears that it is a good luck charm, and at others a curse sent from God. Steve Buscemi, Brendan Fraser, Gladys Knight, Elizabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, and William H. Macy all get their hands on the money, and there are several others as well.Apparently, this screenplay was written several years ago by Andre Bohem and nothing was ever done with it.  After quite a long period of time, Andre's son Leslie got ahold of the script and modernized it a bit, and the end result is magnificent!  While there aren't any acting performances here that are going to melt your hearts, each star is really enjoyable to watch in one way or another.  The casting director did a fantastic job of lining up so many recognizable faces, and I found it hilarious that the stripper at the bachelor party (Melora Walters), also played the funeral director near the end of the movie!  I knew I had seen her face somewhere before and couldn't see it until I saw the credits.  When I realized they were the same person, I busted out laughing, and yet was still able to see the incredible irony of the whole situation.If you are watching this because you like one of the actors, then you very well could be disappointed by what you see.

290,2722856,2014-09-07,braddugg,Uyyala Jampala (2013),6.0,"Happy to have caught this film while it is theaters. I liked it's many moments and it is surely recommended.This film is a simple subject, with nativity filled and some emotions which can strike a chord. It thus gives a winner. The subject is age-old and indeed now Telugu Industry seems to be running out of new subjects and are trying to give us old-wine in new bottles. But who cares, as long as the wine is good. So, we have a film whose subject is old but the treatment is refreshing and it's very simplified. I must say, this actor Raj Tarun would go a long way if he is careful in choosing films and does not fall prey to the predator called ""Telugu Film Industry"". He has done exceedingly well as Soori, and the way he displayed some emotions are wonderful. His slang suits the dialect of the film and he seems effortless in dialog delivery. We have a bunch of those film actors sons or relatives who struggle to complete a sentence and here we have a very unknown face who seems to be saying dialogs as fast as he can. In fact, it was tough for me to catch up with his pace.Avika Gor has done a good job as Uma Devi, I just wish that she was told the feeling well rather than merely asking for an expression. I felt her expressions were not apt at certain moments and were out of place. But overall, she has done a fine job in emoting wherever needed. I loved one scene where she decided to take rounds as Soori breaks coconuts. She runs so fast just to reach a point to see Soori and then on walks slowly. She did it wonderfully, though there was very little to do in this specific scene.Among many technical aspects, the best part in the film is casting. Every small character is played out well. So, more than half of job was done by selecting the right actors. Kudos to the casting department of this. My second biggest thumbs up is to the cinematography and I will have to contact the cinematographer Vishwa D B to say, man you have done a remarkable job. I need to learn so many things from you. I have a few reservations in editing as I feel, a few scenes might have been kept out but since this film in itself is of two hours, I have reservations and no big qualms. The music I wish was used more aptly. The one song I loved which is the title song is ill-timed, I wished there could have been a better way to create the mood of this wonderful song. The music and background score were OK, and I will have to watch it again if I were to judge. The theater, kept the background so heavy that I missed out on lyrics for songs as only the music was heard. The director who is also the writer has done a commendable job in treating this story with simplicity and with no over the top scenes or acts. Love in fact is one of the most abstract and a highly complex feeling which cannot be conveyed very simply, it's an emotion that needs a heart more than mind or words. This film surely has that very heart in the right place. I thanks the producers who have the film it's due in getting it released in considerable number of screens. Also, I hope it does not get lost in the frenzy of the upcoming big films. If it stays there in halls despite the flood, then surely Telugu Film Industry can hope for good days. Should this be taken down, then the drought shall continue as film audience like me will keep avoiding Telugu Films, coz good films are not adequately encouraged.So there you have it, there are many good things that you can see the movie for. From the first recording dance sequence to the last marriage scene, there are many fun moments that go with the flow of the script. Yet, I am not sure if this can be watched many times over as it has nothing great or new to offer. For that reason, I am going with a 3/5. I liked it for sure.Please go see in theaters and do encourage good cinema which seems to be a rarity in a garbage called Telugu Film Industry.",744,0,,0,"No reference.

292,3267975,2017-04-01,Imdbidia,Hardcore Henry (2015),7.0,"Hardcore Henry is truly a fun and full-on breathless movie that will delight both action-movie lovers and video-gamers. This film is like a role-playing video-game. The main features of those games are that the player controls the hero character's actions and movements, the player sees through the main character's eyes, the character has a dangerous mission to carry out, the enemies are violent and have to be avoided and/or fought with more violence, and the mission is carried out in a hostile semi-desolated militarized world. In this film, we 'are' Harry and we see what is happening through his eyes, as if Harry's eyes were ours.The movie is action-packed, very violent and gory at times, raunchy and cheeky, but all of that is counterbalanced by a great dose of humour and hilarious moments that light the overall tone of the film. Besides, the movie doesn't take itself seriously, so it is one of those films that you enjoy fully present with a giant bag of pop-corn on your lap. The film production is very good and, as you can expect, action scenes are excellent. One of the trademarks of this film is the predominance of red and dark-gray colors, something that reflects the tone of the story; however, also here, those are balanced and toned down by some of the green exterior scenes. Tim Roth, in his tiny role as Henry's father; Danila Kozlovsky, as the evil powerful Akan and, above all, Sharlto Copley as the multiple Jimmy, are great in their roles. Although the film is very entertaining and fun, it is also underdeveloped. It lacks something that is very important to good video-games: the introductory presentation. In this intro, the player is offered a mini-short with the background: who the characters are, especially the leading hero; why they are there, what lead to the start of the game, the nature and aim of the mission, and so on. This provides a narrative framework that makes the experience more enjoyable. Unfortunately, this film does not have that sort of intro, not bothers to present viewers with any sort of complexity, so the plot is weak and insubstantial and the characters hollow. And those are the main flaws of the film.",371,0,,0,"No reference.

Moira's imagination goes into overtime as her husband's name is Donald (Michael Craig) & he too had been in Paris the previous weekend supposedly on work commitments, could Moira have inadvertently discovered that her husband is in fact cheating on her & what is she going to do about it?This Tales of the Unexpected story was episode 2 from season 5 & originally aired here in the UK during May 1982, the seventh of eleven Tales of the Unexpected episodes to be directed by John Gorrie this is OK but nothing particularly special. The story by Ruth Wissman was dramatised by Robin Chapman & I suppose is a morality tale about not jumping to conclusions, the dangers of paranoia & to not listen in on other people's conversation's. This one isn't that predictable as it could go either way, perhaps Moira is right & perhaps she isn't & you don't find out until the very end. It moves along at a decent pace at only 25 odd minutes in length & is watchable if nothing else. The twist at the end is alright & it's a neat enough little story, it's just that it's a tad forgettable & nothing special.This one looks OK although hasn't dated too well as with many episodes from this cheaply produced show. There's no scares, suspense or tension in this one & relies on it's basic story to interest & entertain. The acting is OK & I can't believe Michael Craig is in this, he would go on to star in the Australian exploitation flick Turkey Shoot (1982) which is an absolute favourite of mine.

However, the team ends up resurrecting the ghost of the former owner, who was burned to death by the orphan kids.

Mr. Cruise can still make taking down the bad guys look cool, however this is not his finest hour yet it is far from his worst. Oblivion has an eerie and beautiful feeling in regards to the scenery and visuals. The whole production design was sophisticated and had a crisp feel to it. Overall however, I feel that Oblivion had the potential to be a strong outing for Joseph Kosinski yet the third act did not deliver. The film starts out as a simplistic and imposing, Jack Harper (Cruise) feels a strange connection with planet earth and has doubts about migrating to Titan with Victoria (Riseborough) How the film dealt with Harper's connection with a planet lost from the grasp of hope and life allowed me to engage with the film. Yet, the second half of the film felt like it escalated at a quite rapid pace and the conclusion felt slightly rushed. Oblivion should have stayed with its personal and raw approach rather than levelling it up to a hashed conclusion. The action is not being criticised, but it should have been dealt with a more steady pace. Apart from that, Oblivion is a decent sic-fi which does provide some form of excitement. Focusing on the positives, the soundtrack gave Oblivion a sense of depth and the potential for the film to be epic.Oblivion is far from a disaster, it's just failed to reach for the heights of an epic sic-fi blockbuster.",257,0,,0,"No reference.

297,91565,1999-08-14,baumer,The Haunting (1999),2.0,"Warning: may contain some spoilers.But this film has been spoiled.  This film was terrible.  I was so looking forward to The Haunting.  But once again film makers forget what is so obvious to the rest of us, that it is disgusting and repulsive, and that is the fact that very few people know how to make a terrifying film.  Very few people understand the craft and skill behind it.  Because I can honestly count on two hands the films that scared me, or at least left me filled with tension.  So in the history of film there has been about 1000 horror movies made and I have probably seen about 3/4 of them, how come only ten or so can truly scare?  The reason is because most film makers know that a scary film has to have atmoshphere, tension, a good script, perhaps music, lighting or lack thereof ( Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Blair Witch Project ) and a director who knows how to use the camera so that it uses us.  The Haunting has none of that.  The Haunting is filled with lots of loud noises, a non scary entity that shows itself at the end of the film, possessed statues, sheets that move by themselves and every other trick that should make a film like this good.  But what it needs it better camera work, even a little bit of tension and hey, how about a scare or two.  The Haunting contains none of that.  This is one of the biggest disappointments of the summer.  So here is my advice to Jan DeBont.  Whoever directed the trailer, get some pointers from them.  And get Linda Hunt to do some voice over work for the film as well, she had me glued to my seat with anticipation in the trailer ( these are its eyes ).  It's funny too, because Jan De Bont was a DP before he hit it big with Speed.  And one of the films that he was DP for was Cujo.  Now Cujo was a good horror film, not the best, but pretty good.  It's too bad that he couldn't learn from someone even like Lewis Teague, because any effort besides this one would have been better.  This is a disgrace to horror films and even as a film itself it is terrible.  You want to be scared this summer?  Go see Blair Witch and Sixth Sense.  You want to waste two hours?

It's both brilliantly cerebral and mind bogglingly complex. But the movie tightly tells the complex story in 90 minutes, without sacrificing any nuance. It's one of the few movies that I can say I instantly knew I was going to buy the blu-ray right after the credits rolled. Among the many impressive aspects to the story, is the story-telling structure. It feels equally part Nolan and Kubrickian, with a bit of a David Lynch/David Fincher vibe mixed in. However most importantly, Predestination feels like an original film bolstered by performances from the always great Ethan Hawke, as well as the career making turn from Sarah Snook. The depths both of them take their roles, but particularly Snook, is fascinating. And surprisingly neither of them were considered for Oscar noms in 2015.

Getting himself into many scrapes on account of his feelings for Judalon, Bowie invents a new kind of Knife, the Iron Mistress, and from here a legend is born.Nobody should go into this picture expecting a Jim Bowie biography, in fact Western fans who haven't seen it should be advised that it barely registers as a Western piece. What it is, is a fine picture that certainly appears to be undervalued {if a little under seen} on the IMDb site. It's full of dandy men fighting and duelling with honour and guts, beautiful women that are surely worth fighting for, and of course it introduces us to the legendary Bowie Knife.It's based on a Paul Wellman novel, and by all accounts the film is pretty loyal to Wellman's ideals, it doesn't however take us all the way to the Alamo. Alan Ladd takes the lead role of Bowie, shiny blonde hair and brooding for all he is worth, fans of his performance in Shane should definitely check this one out, it's a great performance from Ladd, the kind that makes the gals go gooey and the boys to thump their chests. Virginia Mayo is Judalon and positively simmers with sexual beauty, the character is akin to a viper, and the pot boiling sexual tension is palpable in the extreme, she is in short, a woman men will die for.Some scenes are just terrific, a duel in a darkened room that is only lit by the odd flash of lightning thru a window, a knife fight as two men with one arm tied to each other face off in a circle of honour, and of course Jim Bowie in every encounter, his violent gutsy bravado fearsome as his reputation escalates. At the time of writing only 141 people have voted on this picture, only 10 people have bothered to write a user comment for it, that's a shame because although it may not be a Western as such, it's a damn fine romantic, dandy, drama with a Western legend at its core. 8/10",376,1,undervalued,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Everyone in the film seems to talk in reverse,wear bad makeup and sleeps all day,girls address themselves to the camera they act like idiots or talk to it,but probably it's the point of view of a john,we never hear,""hey it happens""during the vomiting, ""Ameara lavey""no relation to the Satanic preacher who seems to have a voice of a man and spends the whole time having makeup dripping down her eyes. There are dizzying jump cuts,the sound effects are repetitive,and the actresses in this film seem to look very dirty and quite sad,which was probably their motivation,the film if you would call it that has strong misogynistic undertones and Valentine has fun making their actors' voices from normal to reverse,maybe after trying to turn his records backwards he tries to prove his lines might say something demonic..but it loses its purpose and gets annoying,there isn't much good diologue in this film and if it does,its about the girl's making themselves vomit,again addressing the camera and the difficulty of hearing the women talk because Lucifer slows down their voices.There's a sad scene when Angela played by""Ameara Lavey""incoherently tells a story when she was 13 she set fire to a church.We hear lots of strange sounds in the soundtrack that might probably be the boom operator scratching the boom mike across a wall or pots and pans being hit together.

316,1753405,2009-01-17,meeza,Revolutionary Road (2008),8.0,"Director Sam Mendes' suburbia melancholy tic is still ticking with his latest subversive (synonym of revolutionary) film ""Revolutionary Road"". The film is not really a revolutionist one as it is a sinister one; sinister in the sense of marriage peccadillo. Mendes brings us the usual no-no's of marriage that have been mores in the matrimony world in the last few decades: adultery, deceit, lies, dissatisfaction, and escapism. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as Frank & April Wheeler, a young married couple with two kids living in a Connecticut suburb in the mid 1950's. Frank Wheeler unenthusiastically just goes with the motion in his mundane office job living paycheck by paycheck. April Wheeler is a stay-at-home mom and part-time amateur actress who longs for more than the life she is living. Therefore, a Wheeler Revolution must occur! So they decide to move to Paris. They inform their archetypal suburban married neighbors (and best friends) Shep and Milly Campbell of their Tour de France plans; The Campbells think it is all talk soup, even with their stunned expressions. That scene is probably the elite one the film. The Wheeler's revolutionary Paris road plans come to a dead end when Frank gets an unexpected promotion and the zenith of the Wheeler Marriage Civil War begins. ""Revolutionary Road"" should not be part of an itinerary for a Marriage Retreat because most of the film shows the Wheelers emotionally bickering about various contrived sentiments and psychological conflicts. DiCaprio and Winslet's titanic performances are Oscar worthy; but Winslet wins out between the two. Nevertheless, my favorite performance of the film was Michael Shannon's scene-stealing work as John Gibins, the mentally troubled son of the Wheeler's real estate confidante Helen Gibins. Shannon portrays John Gibins as a real straight shooter who fires emotional verbal blows to the Wheelers which get them off track in saving their marriage. I hope the Academy does shadow my Shannon sentiment by giving him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kathy Bates is ""gibin"" us some more fine acting in the twilight of her career with her solid work as Helen Gibins. Justin Haythe's screenplay based on Richard Yates ""Revolutionary Road"" novel gives the best-seller literary work a respectful proper credence. You gotta have Haythe in your promising screenwriter list. Roger Deakins' astounding cinematography should garner him yet another Oscar nomination; copy that Roger. But let's divert back to Sam the Man! Mendes, Mr. Kate Winslet himself, admirably continues to direct stories on marriage tribulations that cause eventual destruction on many psychological effects on a couple and those close around. He did it proficiently with ""American Beauty"" and does an encore with it in ""Revolutionary Road""; even though I thought Beauty was superior to Road. When you first cinematically drive through ""Revolutionary Road"" it seems like just a mediocre movie ride; but before you could say ""mental revolution"" it does linger in your mind for a few days and that is a prominent sign of a powerful film. Follow your movie G.P.S. and take a ride through ""Revolutionary Road"". **** Good",510,0,,0,"No reference.

This one has Bond battling an evil organization, known as SPECTRE, as well as corrupt political forces. It was directed by Sam Mendes (who also helmed the last Bond flick, 'SKYFALL') and it was written by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Jez Butterwort. The movie costars Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Dave Bautista, Andrew Scott and Monica Bellucci. It's not quite as good as 'SKYFALL' or 'CASINO ROYALE', but it is one of the better Bond films (throughout the franchise's history).James Bond (Craig) is on a special mission, given to him by the deceased M (Judi Dench), before she died, to track down a ruthless organization known as SPECTRE. He's relieved from duty, by his new superior, the new M (Fiennes), but travels to Rome anyway; in pursuit of the terrorist organization. Bond finds aid from former allies, Q (Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Harris), while also falling for the daughter of a previous enemy, named Dr. Madeline Swann (Seydoux). Bond also finds lethal opposition, from the head of SPECTRE, Franz Oberhauser (Waltz), and his deadly henchman, Mr. Hinx (Bautista). At the same time there's a political struggle, between the new M and the new head of the Joint Intelligence Service, called C (Scott); who wants to eliminate the '00' program.The movie cost between $245 and $300 million to make, and it's reportedly one of the most expensive films ever made; you can see nearly every dollar of it up on screen though! The action scenes are breathless and geniuslly done. I really like Bautista as Mr. Hinx; I think he's probably the best Bond goon since Richard Kiel, as Jaws. At times the film even feels a lot like 'THE SPY WHO LOVED ME'. The romance, of the film, is completely unbelievable though (even for a Bond movie) and Seydoux was severely miscast as a Bond girl (her and Craig have absolutely no chemistry together). I wish Bellucci (the oldest actress ever cast as a Bond girl, at 51) didn't have such a small part.

It's just so terrible! I've always loved Bones (and have binged the series many times), but I've come to the point where I can't just sit back and shut up about this. The portrayal of Norwegians, Metalheads and the likes in this episode is disgusting and offensive, and it makes me wonder how many other countries, cultures, and sub-cultures they've offended throughout the years, because I can't think this is the only time they've done this. First off, in the opening when the ""policeman"" (aka SWAT - which doesn't actually exist in Norway) and the ""detective"" are speaking, the ""detective"" barely speaks Norwegian at all, and it made me cringe so hard. Yes we have a lot of dialects in Norway, but that is not a Norwegian dialect, it's like hearing an English speaker trying to say a Norwegian sentence for the first time (Like Brennan trying to say 'skalle', and mispronouncing it terribly). Oh and btw, all the ""detective's"" lines sounds like they've been translated with a beta-version of google translate. At least get a Norwegian actor if you're going to represent another country, like the ""SWAT leader"".Now to the ""SWAT leader"" or whatever the hell they're supposed to be anyway, I'm happy he's actually Norwegian, but that doesn't weigh up for the terrible acting and totally horrid misrepresentation of our law enforcement. You seriously don't need ""SWAT"" to storm into a metal concert in any country, a few cops and some security guys would have been enough (not that even that would have been needed, but if they really wanted to make it look dramatic that would have at least made it look plausible), and 95% of the folks there would have had no problem calming down and allowing the police to do their job. Also storming a concert with SWAT is just plain stupid. I don't care that this is fiction and all, it still pisses me off. (Also any comments made about our police is disgusting, they make it sound like we should have more murders, that our police ""need more practice"" and that they're incompetent at doing their job.) I could probably rant about the totally stereotypical portrayal of Norwegians as well, but you get my point.So, over to the portrayal (both in description from the team and visually) of ""metalheads"", it's so cliché that I wanted to bang my head into the wall 60% of the episode. It's like the entire concept of metal, and any sub-genre of it, the producers and directors have, is from their own time as teens back in the late 70's and throughout the 80's, and from some select myspace pages (which was at the time of this episode's release (2009), almost a dead platform) which the producers and directors apparently wasn't aware of. Also if offending was their goal with this episode, they definitely did it with the whole satanic thing, and the ""all metalheads loves gore, death and destruction"". If it's still unclear for you, yes I find this disgusting and offensive, not just because they're using the most idiotic stereotypes, but also because they paint the picture to outsiders that metalheads (or anyone belonging to that sub-culture) should be regarded with caution, that they're prone to violence and that they lack any respect for anything and anyone. Also that all of them/us are depressed, misguided and/or ""freaks"". And what the hell is up with that make-up/face-paint all the time? No one does that any more. Yes it was popular once, in the 80's and early 90's!I'm sorry, but anyone saying this was a good episode, have to have had rose-tinted glasses on. The rest of the episode (the 40% I didn't want to bash my head in) was at the scenes with Sweets and his story development, and the ones with Gordon.

No matter how he has approached or wooed the author, Brit P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) she has refused to sign over the rights. But, things change. Her money is running out and she does love her beautiful house and amenities. Therefore, this crabby lady finally agrees to come to Los Angeles and meet with Disney himself. When she arrives, she is met by a very personal limo driver (Paul Giamatti) but she shows him no warmth. Nor does the hotel room, filled with Disney stuffed animals, change her attitude. Most of the creatures go in a closet, while Mickey Mouse has to sit in the corner. At the studio, the celebrated composers Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert Sherman are targets of her unpleasantness, as are all of the other staff members. Just why is this dame so contrary, when everyone is rolling out the bright red carpet? In flashback, the viewer learns of her difficult, unstable childhood in Australia.

In addition, he dies young and the children are subjected to stuffy Aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths). What will it take to please Miss Travers and get her name on the dotted line? For all movie fans who love the terrific Disney classic, Mary Poppins, here is the tale of how it almost never got made! Ms. Travers was one witch-on-wheels whose demands were only exceeded by her horrible disposition. Yes, she had a difficult childhood, which explains but does not excuse her perpetual coldness. Only Emma Thompson could bring her to life with some small saving graces. The rest of the cast, too, is superb, with Hanks, Griffiths, Giamatti, Schwartzman, and company doing a fantastic job.

337,3186529,2016-11-27,dworldeater,The Omega Man (1971),9.0,"I personally enjoy all these film adaptations of Richard Matheson's novel, but The Omega Man is by far my favorite of the three. This stars Hollywood icon Charlton Heston, who was on a roll during this period(late 60's/early70's) with one dystopian science fiction classic after another. The Omega Man is by far the most action packed of the lot. Charlton Heston is the last man on Earth, he rolls around town in style with a muscle car and submachine gun. In this post apocalyptic action classic the population of the world was wiped out by a plague caused by biological warfare. Those who have survived are albino mutants known as The Family who are nocturnal and shun technology and blame technology for destroying the world. Which puts our hero Neville(Heston), man of science on their hit list. Heston fortunately has a well balanced gun collection and usually handles his intruders with ease. He does find another group of uninfected survivors which includes foxy lady Rosalind Cash, who was a fine piece of dark chocolate and sexy mamma. Heston and Cash get down and broke taboos of interracial relationships for the time period.(Or at least their characters did in the film) As far as I am concerned The Omega Man has pretty much nothing not to like about it. It is well made, well acted , nicely shot and filled with social commentary, action and one liners. The Omega Man is action packed, thought provoking and at times funny. While Charlton Heston was one of the best actors to have ever lived and had success in many different genres, he is in my opinion best in science fiction and The Omega Man is essential and a classic.",286,0,,0,"No reference.

Some have more or less disturbing small adventures, shown in short episodes, all about one kind of sex or other.Comments: A comedy split in small episodes, each with a little different story only loosely connected with each other. What they got in common is that at least one person in each episode is a teen who is attending the local high school.The jokes is only focused on sex, and actually even more crude and low than they use to be in a teen comedy. Some is so bad it is only embarrassing, but then again, there are a few jokes which are still pretty bad, but where I couldn't help myself and laugh a little. Otherwise, perhaps the best part of the movie is that it is only 73 minutes long and over quickly.What is a little surprising is that the they got such a big cast to agree to this, and surprisingly a few known actors and actresses.

And it's not fully deserving of that. In a way, the reaction to this movie was fairly reflective of 2020. We didn't get what we wanted, so we complained.This one is a bit different from its predecessor. And if you go watch the interview the director did with IGN, you'll understand why. DC/WB made a lot of the big scenes mandatory in the first WW. She wanted to tone it down a bit for this one and show more of the human side of the character.In a way, it has some elements of the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman film series and other 1980's superhero movies/shows. The hero who constantly feels out of place, someone they meet becomes the villain, and the villain is just a nobody who becomes a somebody.The ending of the intro sets the stage for the film. Diana has to learn a lesson as a girl, which will carry over into the future. The lesson that we don't always get what we want, and lying doesn't help the cause. It's been almost 70 years since the first movie ends, and Diana has seemingly been covertly helping keep the bad guys in check. Nothing is said about what she did over that time span. She's learned new powers, but at the same time she is reserved and not as bold as in WW1.You have the 2 villains, who are both misfits of society who just want to be noticed. And they're willing to do whatever it takes for that to happen. And their lust for greed and power slowly overtakes them to the point they lose who they are. And the truth eventually gets to them.The battles are spread throughout the movie, instead of one major climatic battle to end it.The Steve Trevor side plot is weird and eventually boils down to helping Diana remember who she is supposed to be. It almost detracts from the story.WW3 was announced the same week WW84 released. In a way, this movie felt more like a setup for something to come.

Once in London, the duo live with friends and attempt to adjust to local customs.Early in ""Secret People"", Maria meets Louis (Serge Reggiani), a childhood sweetheart who works for a radical group intent on assassinating the unnamed dictator Maria's family has fled. This dictator is visiting British dignitaries, and so Louis requires Maria's assistance to smuggle a bomb into his presence. Maria thus finds herself torn between loyalty to her adopted homeland and loyalty to Louis' terrorist group. The film ends with Maria betraying Louis and admonishing those who would bring violence to the shores of a kindly, all inclusive, democratic nation like Great Britain. As Britain's long had ties to fascist regimes, as it has long operated fascist groups as the strong-arm of its ruling class, and as it specialises in backing terrorists, dictatorships, theocracies and far-right groups (everything from Mussolini to Charles Maxwell Knight, a proud fascist and wartime head of MI5), the film's creepy message reeks of hypocrisy.If ""Secret People"" has a bright spot, it's young Audrey Hepburn who twirls her way through Dickson's film like a ray of sunshine.

As the movie opens, we see how a guy (we later learn his name is Gerry) walks into a local casino in Dubuque, Iowa. He must be a regular as everyone knows him. But at his poker table, there is one new face, a younger guy named Curtis. Gerry is in real estate and way down on his luck. Curtis oozes charm and confidence. They bit it off nicely, and on a whim, decide to drive to New Orleans to enter into a 'big game' (buy-in price is $25K). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writers-directors (and real life partners) Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (they previously brought us ""It's Kind Of a Funny Story""). Here they tackle the subject matter of gambling, and more precisely the addition to gambling. Combine that with the road movie angle, and you've got yourself an update to ""California Split"" of yesteryear. That aside, the movie is really a character study. Gerry (played by Ben Mendelsohn) is someone who you feel sorry for, although he is not quite the 'loveable loser'. At one point he goes to visit his ex-wife in Little Rock, and you can just feel the devastation set in when he learns she has remarried and didn't even tell him. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as the confidence-oozing Curtis. ""You'll be my lucky charm"" Gerry tells Curtis as they hit the road to New Orleans. Sienna Miller is okay as the love interest of Curtis. As mentioned, this is a road movie, and we get the best scenery from cities like St. Louis, Memphis, Little Rock, etc. Kudos also for the outstanding soundtrack, which features tons of 'old school' blues artists and songs. All that said, the sum of the parts don't measure up to the total of the movie, which lacks the compelling elements needed to pull me in.""Mississippi Grind"" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend.

With Tennant as ever giving a splendid performance as The Doctor, with honourable mentions going to Bernard Cribbins and Russell Tovey, there is nothing wrong with the performances in this episode. However, Russell T. Davies' style as a writer for Doctor Who is fairly tired now, and his clichés are all too recognisable now, and instead of being treated to a scary, intriguing ride, we are left with a fairly standard adventure which appears to outstay its welcome.In this adventure, The Doctor travels on a spaceship named the Titanic so that his TARDIS can recover from when it was unexpectedly hit by the aforementioned ship at the end of the previous series. Whilst travelling, The Doctor befriends a maid called Astrid (itself an anagram of Tardis), played delightfully by Kylie Minogue. He finds out that they are currently travelling several miles above the Earth. However, tragedy strikes when the Titanic is hit by three meteors and is headed straight towards the Earth. The Doctor then takes charge of a few survivors of the initial collision and resolves to take them to the Bridge of the ship, whilst avoiding a group of murderous robotic angels, known as the Host.This episode is definitely not without its moments, highlights including when The Doctor and Astrid visit London, only to find it completely deserted because people are afraid that there will be another alien attack at Christmas, following the attempted invasion of the Sycorax in ""The Christmas Invasion"" and the attack by the Empress of the Racnoss in ""The Runaway Bride"".

It was the first film to star both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, although they had not yet become a comedy partnership.

Judi Dench looks uncomfortable in her role, unfortunately. Everyone else fulfills exactly what their character would have expected of them. Diesel gets some very good lines. The bad guys are baaad with planet destroyers and everything. I would have preferred less time on the prison planet and more time fighting Necromungan hordes.One major complaint though, becoming seemingly more and more popular in action flicks unfortunately: Close in, very fast cuts, and very shaky camera during fights. I swear to god, I'm going to start an international petition to film-makers to stop using this technique. You can't see what's going on. No one likes it. It smacks of amateurishness on the part of the director (don't know how to shoot a good fight scene). Absolutely rubbish and frustrating for the audience who've spent a couple of hours waiting to see the hero do the violence on the bad guy, then find themselves getting sea-sick and wondering who's doing what to who. Only film I've seen recently where I thought it was effective was 'Master and Commander', as it suits the tightly packed, screaming mobs of merely human sailors fighting on a narrow deck. Every other film with this has been spoiled by it. 'The Bourne Supremacy' had a car chase with it, for god's sake.Please, never again.Apart from that. I thought this was a great film.

361,2694310,2014-07-16,ferguson-6,A Hard Day's Night (1964),9.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's the 50th anniversary and what a treat to see the re-mastered, restored film in a crowded theatre - many wearing their Beatles shirts. The quasi-documentary, cinema verite' approach from director Richard Lester may not fit the traditional idea of a great movie, but at a minimum, it's a fantastic pop culture artifact showing a world on the verge of change.This is The Beatles first film and this is the most innocent and fresh-faced we ever see them ... it's just a few months after their first appearance on ""the Ed Sullivan Show"". John is the most guarded, but his quick wit and distrust of the establishment are obvious. Paul is at his cutest and least arrogant, but still managing to pose on cue. George comes across most open and full of joy - before he became the most publicly withdrawn. Ringo is self-deprecating and in full hang-dog mode.For a stark contrast, watch the four lads a year later in HELP!, also directed by Mr. Lester. The luster of fame has clearly tarnished and they are quite aware of the power they wield. Still, during this shoot, we are almost ""on set"" as the boys are first experiencing Beatlemania! In addition to the Fab Four, British actor Wilfrid Brambill plays Paul's Grandfather. The recurring gag of him being ""very clean"" is a play on Brambill's long-running role as Albert Steptoe in ""Steptoe & Son"" where he is referred to as ""a dirty old man"". Victor Spinetti plays the very anxious TV director wearing the infamous sweater. Mr. Spinetti also appeared in HELP! (1965) and The Magical Mystery Tour (1967). Richard Vernon played the grumpy old man sharing the train car with the boys. Mr. Vernon also appeared in Goldfinger that same year. Another James Bond link occurs when Ringo is invited to the Le Cercle Club ... the same club James Bond first appears in Dr. No (1962). Lastly, Pattie Boyd is one of the giggly schoolgirls on the train and appears in 3 different scenes. 18 months later, she was married to George Harrison ... and a few years later, she proved her attraction to lead guitarists by marrying Eric Clapton.I was caught off guard by the frenetic pace of the film ... it has been 3 decades since I last watched it. But mostly, I was stunned at the clean look of this restored version and was awed by the terrific sound, especially of the song restorations completed by Giles Martin, the son of Beatles record producer George Martin ... who was nominated for an Academy Award for his film score.The film inspired the 1960's TV show ""The Monkees"", and of course, the soundtrack was a massive seller. ""If I Fell"" is one of my favorite Beatles songs and it's a nice segment in the film, but the real climax is the performance of ""She Loves You"", replete with terrific crowd shots. The impact and lasting impression of the film is every bit as recognizable as that stunning opening chord to the title track that opens the film.",515,0,,0,"No reference.

Other horrible films from that same period include Pete's Dragon, the Last Flight of Noah's Ark, Unidentified Flying Oddball and the dreaded Condorman. I'll not mention Tron because I thought it ambitious and Miller was only the executive Producer on it, so he had little to do with the actual production. However he was in full force when this god-awful piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity. Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo. Second sequel to much- loved Love Bug tale finds Herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too. There's a race, some lame bad guys, a diamond and Barney Fife. Shot in France, the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely. But one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in France. The rest of film is a wreck. Prat falls, bumbling thieves, wicked German racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply. The biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop Herbie's lover personality via shakes, beeps, flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old, Disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little VW.

The Doctor has a few tricks up his sleeve, but then again so might the Daleks.Review of all seven episodes -It might be the second greatest classic Dalek story ever. I love the concepts behind the Dizzy Daleks. They're what makes the story so much fun fun, so memorable, and great Dalek humor. Had me laughing there.About the Dalek Emperor. He is the scariest Dalek ever. His tone is utterly terrifying you doesn't wish to mess with the great mighty Dalek Emperor.The Final End scene is just the second cool scene in Dalek history, a 5-minute scene where we see Chaos erupting in the Dalek city. Thus beginning the Dalek Civil War between three Daleks who are Alpha, Beta, and Omega against all of the Dalek Empire, they won! I love those dizzy Daleks. Memorable scenes where they were taking the Doctor a ride and saying:""Dizzy... Dizzy... Doctor!"" etc.
Such a shame that this story has only six missing episodes and one surviving episode; I would love to see the astounding so-called Final End of the Daleks and many scenes.The Evil of the Daleks had the coolest send-off of the Daleks. It felt that there was no chance of survival. The story was beautifully designed, very visual, had a cool down-chilling famous 1-minute Dalek theme that's called, and had a great concept of the menacing Dalek Emperor. Such an insanely good episode because this story was originally meant to be the Final End for the Daleks. But of course, the audiences freaked out there one Dalek casing was pulsing after the ultimate destruction of the Dalek Empire.It was a good idea to set the Daleks in a Victorian timescale. Jamie did spectaculary in this story that leads me to choose him as the second-best companion of all-time in Doctor Who since he has the longest-running companion time shown.

She cannot fail yet there are many obstacles in her way before she can succeed.Continuing the trend of Blackwatch films being clever, imaginative and fun, this film cleverly mixes styles and realities to comic effect where you're not sure which side of the film is real - but are enjoying it too much to care.  The plot jumps around between the holiday and the holiday as Molly sees it.  Some of it is clearly her imagination going wild, but other bits are very real in presentation.  This mix makes it interesting.The style is very good too, the short merges between the two realities and is a really cool spy type of presentation, music and mood.  The humour comes from the imagination of the short and it works very well.  The voice work is very good and works well to help the mood of the film.While it may not be the most meaningful short in the world, that is not important, as it does what it sets out to do and is entertaining and enjoyable.

When a bus accident occurs involving the Van Traylen Trust, the only survivor is the young girl Mary Valley. The behaviour of Mary has Dr Haynes worried, so he tries his best to dig up information on her and this leads to her original mother/convicted murderer. She wants Mary back, but the Trust manages to bring her back to their orphanage on the Scottish isle of Bala. Police Colonel Bingham believes there's more to these deaths, and soon his trying to protect the Trust from Mary's mother who believes that they turned her daughter against her. Also pathologist Sir Mark Ashley and reporter Joan Foster start digging up some vital dirt, which could answer many questions. ""Nothing But the Night"" seems to fall more in the interesting bracket, than the successful one. Peter Sasdy's minor mystery chiller is a moderate attempt made more accessible due to the presence of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. It was actually produced under Lee's Charlemagne production company, and would be the last one too. These two icons of the genre can make anything watchable and even though they might not be as prominent here. They still have the ability to leave their mark when they aren't on screen. Brain Hayles' cryptic screenplay (taken off John Blackburn's novel) works up a smart, if overly padded script and captivating dying half, but the knotty plot doesn't seem to click, as it moves all over the place making it hard to get comfortable and come to terms with the haunting pay-off. You might find the twist kinda obvious, but the true revelation throws you off. It does take quite awhile to hit its straps. Which could turn people off from its talkative and slow progression. However the timidly restraint and uncertain nature only makes the final 10 minutes even more unnerving, as that's when the murder mystery makes way for some creepy horror strokes. Both Sasdy and Hayles do a good enough job in keeping the viewer interested. Sasdy uses the open locations to great effect, and ably stages the set pieces with efficient slickness and ominously dark shades. Malcolm Williamson's lightly smooth jazzy score stays on the back-burner and Ken Talbot's sturdy photography keeps it stark and upfront. The performances are considerably tailor-made. Lee (more uptight than usual) and Cushing are at their assured best, even if they only have lesser parts. The spruce Diana Dors makes for a good fiery, eccentric turn and Georgia Brown's is equally impressive as the down-to-earth reporter. Gwyneth Strong wonderfully draws up her part as Mary.

His delivery is wrong on so many counts that it just hurts and he's with out a doubt the worst actor for the role because we don't believe in him or his struggles. The rest of the film is almost tailor made to fit Keanu's horrible acting like a glove excerpt for the great performance of Rachel Weisz, who not only gives this movie more meaning than it really deserves but gives the only good and solid performance with a character that has more dimensions than the movie itself. Weisz's character is the only credible character in the entire script and that's a real godsend because the rest of the script not only lacks believability in its story but lacks accountability in its execution as well because the story really does not make any sense at all.

It begins as a trivial comedy, she works in a fishing factory on the east coast, while most men are after her, especially the adventurous smuggler Gino, who proves risky. She resists him as long as possible, but the way he acts and uses force makes it impossible for her not to get caught in a trap of destiny.The story unfolds in the great Italian neo-realistic fashion, the story could have been a subject for Vittorio de Sica or Visconti, the atmosphere is the same as in ""Bicycle Thieves"" and other down to earth Italian dramas at the time, and although you are sceptical at first, the drama will more and more overwhelm you. A policeman, who truly loves her, tries to save her, but instead he unintentionally only makes matters worse, and ultimately you will understand why she has to prefer the criminal to him.But the greatest asset of the film is perhaps the location, the genuine environment among the fishermen on the east coast living in very basic conditions, their small Sunday pleasures at the dancing party, and the wonderful local people - this should actually be a classic",241,0,,0,"No reference.

Jordan), a 22-year-old African American, shot and killed by an officer of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) at the Fruitvale subway station in Oakland, California after returning celebrating New Years Eve with his friends in 2009. At the beginning of the film, actual footage is shown of the shooting but we do not yet know anything about the deceased man, his life and his dreams.Winner of both the Gran Prix and Audience Awards at Sundance and a first-film prize winner in the Un Certain Regard competition at Cannes, Fruitvale Station is a work of powerful authenticity that allows us to connect more closely with the man and the incident beyond the information we may receive on TV news. Conducting research and interviews with family and friends, the events unfold like a thriller, even though we know the inevitable outcome. Although some scenes are added for dramatic effect, there is no attempt to sugar coat Grant's life and he is presented, warts and all, as a hot-tempered ex-con, a drug dealer, an unreliable employee, and an unfaithful partner.Oscar is flawed like the rest of us but the astute and moving performance by Michael B. Jordan allows us to discover his humanity and care about him. Working to get his life back, he has received his GED despite having dropped out of high school, and has given up selling drugs. Coogler takes us through his day, which we know will be his last. Although he was fired from his job, he returns to the supermarket where he last worked to ask his boss to reconsider. He gets some food for his mother Wanda's (Octavia L. Spencer) birthday party in the evening, picks up a card for his sister who cannot come to the party, sees his daughter Tatiana (Ariana Neal), tells his girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz) that he loves her, and helps a young woman who needs advice on making a fish fry by having her talk to his grandmother (Marjorie Shears).After his mother's party, Oscar and Sophina and their friends go to San Francisco to celebrate the New Year. On their return, their celebration is cut short by cruel and unnecessary police violence caught on cell phone video which went viral and led to protest demonstrations throughout the Bay Area. Coogler's handling of the scene does not hammer us with the gruesomeness of the events but allows the audience to act simply as a witness to the crime. One of the most poignant scenes is when Oscar's mother sees his body and cries ""I told him to get on the train... I didn't think they'd hurt my baby."" Ultimately, the officer who did the shooting, Johannes Mehserle, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter by a jury in Los Angeles, and served eleven months in prison after he claimed that he intended to use his taser rather than his pistol. Although there is little doubt that the director is sympathetic to Oscar's story, Fruitvale Station does not assault us with a message, but on the eve of the profiling and shooting of an unarmed black boy in Sanford, Florida, the message is clear and does not need to be spelled out.While the incident may be different than that of Trayvon Martin, it cannot stand apart from the long history of racial injustice and the inequality of the legal system in America. While the film will not end racial tension, it may go a long way towards opening people's eyes about the reality of police misconduct.

381,3469363,2017-12-26,jrarichards,What We Did on Our Holiday (2014),10.0,"Today's generation gap is huge, parents find coping with with the organised chaos that is modern life an almost insuperable problem, and yet somewhere down the line kids need their parents - and hugely also their grandparents, and of course both parties can benefit if for once we just drop the stupid, profane and mostly meaningless burdens of everyday life and think about what really matters. Communing a bit with nature might do that, and from the off we know that ""What we did on our holiday"" is going to be selling the inspiringly gorgeous Scottish Highlands and Islands to us - including the midges (whose presence the film is big enough to admit to). In general, this offering both written and directed by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin dwells a lot on peoples' lying (for a vareity of reasons), yet is supremely, at times touchingly, at times even brutally, honest in its approach. Its integrity shines through. To make this work, the makers needed two sets of messed up parents to begin with (and this job is very well done by David Tennant + Rosamund Pike, as well as Ben Miller (the best thing he's done I believe) + Amelia Bullmore. Here we have two brothers markedly different from one another plus their wives. On paper, the Miller character Gavin is more successful than that played by Tennant, but he has the small difficulty of actually explaining what he even does! Basically, he's a ""short seller"" (whatever that is), and his young nephews and nieces make the kind of innocently witty remarks on that score that you might expect - to fine good comic effect! Exactly what brother Doug does is not clear either, but both of their marriages have some issues. But the stars of this show are grandparent and kids, and here there is nothing less than dream-fulfilment, as those who have long imagined how great a slightly toned-down but still pithy Billy Connolly might prove to be get their rewards. Poor old grandad is on the way out due to cancer and he is now (on the occasion of his 75th birthday party) ready, even desperate, to communicate some of his real, fundamental thoughts about the world. He feels he's not going to do very well with his sons and daughters-in-law, but wonders if he might reach them through the kids, at the same time as reaching the kids. Ultimately, he achieves more than he bargains for, when actually dying on the beach while in those kids' company; and he thus gives rise to the film's crescendo ending (on which score I'll avoid all spoilers).Many of the lines Connolly gets to utter are just superb, and the way he puts them across likewise. It's a treat.However, as Connolly interacts magnificently with Emilia Jones as Lottie, Bobby Smalldridge as Mickey and Harriet Turnbull as the youngest Jess, even he is at the same time being upstaged by them. These kids are just splendidly talented, appealing, and extremely, extremely funny. What is more, they often convey huge meaning in what they say and do, as kids invariably will. There is total, disarming authenticity here.Lottie - being the oldest - is most affected by her parents' marital problems, and has become rather withdrawn and anxious. Seeing her transform with the events of the film is a moving and at times powerful joy to watch. More depth and reality is conveyed by Emilia Jones's performance than in many, many previous films we've seen.Indeed, comedy laugh-out-loud this may be, but we take a great deal of value and meaning from this piece if we focus in on it (and also if we perservere through a perhaps slightly unpromising-looking first few minutes).Let's face it, a family get-together in a big house in the remote and beautiful wilds of Scotland is a concept that has a lot going for it from the outset, but the gem of giving equal weight to three generations of the family (with actors truly capable of pushing that idea through), of allowing the lines to flow with such a mix of wit and wisdom, of achieving the perfect mix of physical and verbal comedy, and of pursuing a plot-line of typically British eccentricity, is a really great achievement that should not be underestimated.At moments, ""What we did on our holiday"" risks straying towards the syrupy or naive, but it mostly, mainly stays on the right side of the line. That'as deft work by the makers. The film also very wisely plays only slightly with the English-Scottish stuff, remaining good-humoured and avoiding easy laughs based around divisiveness in favour of meaningful content that Brits from Land's End to John O'Groats can readily identify with. And they certainly should do so, as the rewards are very considerable. I expected little here and got a very great deal (appropriately enough on Christmas Day). I believe many, many others will find the same as I did.",824,0,,0,"No reference.  The review is a detailed description of the reviewer's experience and thoughts about the film.

Inasmuch as it sublimates their desire to punch each other I suppose boxing serves a useful social purpose. You certainly can't blame a working-class stiff from New Jersey like Jim Braddock from using his fast right fist and high tolerance for punishment as a way out of grinding poverty for his family, and he was an inspiring figure for many in the 1930s. This is not a person trying to find themselves through fisticuffs like Hilary Swank's tragic character in ""Million Dollar Baby"".""Cinderella Man"" (a title bestowed on Braddock by legendary journalist Damon Runyon) is a superior Hollywood biopic from journeyman director Ron Howard who previously directed Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"", a biopic about a more cerebral man, the brilliant and troubled Nobel prize-winning mathematician John Nash. Hence there is plenty of schmaltz and contrived emotion, almost to Spielbergian proportions, but there are also good production values and thus we get a fine recreation of the look and feel of the depression years in the urban US. There is also some fine acting.Russell plays Braddock as a fairly quiet, very stoic and steely determined man who sticks to his values throughout. An old-fashioned hero, in fact, with moments of desperation but not much self-doubt (and not much time for it either). He is an exemplary husband and father. It's a pretty low-key performance but well-judged. When he's not throwing telephones at hapless hotel desk clerks Russell can do a good job. Paul Giamatti as Joe the agent gives us a well-rounded character rather than a caricature and Renee Zellweger ably supports Russ as Mae Braddock.As this is a biopic, it can be revealed that Braddock eventually prevails and was world champion until defeated by Joe Louis two years later. In his championship fight against Max Baer (turned into a bad guy for the purposes of the movie via a wonderful bit of hamming by Craig Bierko), Braddock won by lasting the distance (all 15 rounds) just a bit better than Baer. There is a lot of actual boxing in what is quite a long film and we get to see about half the title fight. For me, the boxing scenes could have been shorter but as we know, people pay to see this sort of thing and Howard is not about to disappoint the crowd. The suspense is terrific, even if you know the result.But the last word has to be with Paul Simon:In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down or cut him 'til he cried out in his anger and his shame I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains",495,0,,0,"No reference.

The film gives a voice to many successful, hard working African Americans with strong family, patriotic values who would otherwise be dismissed or ignored by the modern left and also feature's many popular conservatives such as Candace Owen's, Brandon Tatum, Herman Cain and of course the great Larry Elder. When watching the film you see how sharp and intelligent these great patriots are due to the fact it is nearly impossible for African American conservatives to live in a bubble as they are consistently forced to challenge their own views and face strong pushback and slander for the views they hold. I have always said the nightmare scenario for the left would be for blacks and whites to be United behind common values of strong family unit, patriotism,individualism, and conservatism.

A ""what if"" that could make a good story; perhaps an episode-long piece on ""60 Minutes"" or ""20/20"".Bryan Fogel, who directed it, is like a man wanting to learn what is like to be a tiger and, in wanting to get closer to the truth, inadvertently locks himself in the tiger's cage.Icarus is like two stories. The silly, and somewhat egotistical quest of Bryan Fogel to prove that doping is rampant and easy to get away with (duh!) while helping himself win the amateur race that has eluded him for years. It is difficult to find a way to sympathize for any person during this part of the story. Then Bryan meets a very amusing and very cynical Russian scientist named Grigory Rodchenkov, who is going to help him. They talk via Skype frequently, and even their dogs participate. We then go into the obligatory montage of training, preparation, and failures that seems all too familiar. That is, until something changes.There is a marked and brilliant turning point in the movie when Grigory, a smiling and joking class clown up until that point, faces directly at the camera in a Skype conversation with Bryan and asks ""have you seen a movie about me?"" From that point on, the story's point of view changes from Bryan to Grigory and we learn something that we cannot unlearn, and realize that there is no going back. We learn that Grigory is the real protagonist and we are heading in a very dark and dangerous direction for Grigory, for Bryan, and for those around them.One cannot blame those viewers who, prior to that point, were bored and wondered if this would be yet another expose on how privileged guys like Bryan were cheating the system for a moment of temporary glory and how doping had permeated into the weekend warriors scene. One cannot blame those viewers for walking away (I almost did), if they thought that's where we were going. I am sure that's where Bryan thought he was going too. That is, until the cage locked behind us...What I call the second story in Icarus is based on terror; a terror of the light, not the dark, to borrow a line from Grigory. Real people get killed (allegedly) - this is a documentary, so death is very real. The ride is frantic, claustrophobic, and bitter-sweet. There is an ending but, then again, there isn't one. At the end of the story, we care deeply for Grigory, Bryan, and even Max the dog, and continue to wonder ""what if"".Icarus is one of the most brilliant documentaries that I have ever seen.",450,0,mentions other viewers in another context,0,"No reference.

Sadly, it was.Like many of the other reviewers here, neither of us could believe that a senior police officer could possibly be so incredibly naive that she could believe she could get away with entering into a relationship with a recently released killer. A 20 year old DC? Maybe. A Commander level with years of experience? Not in a million years. And yet that is what La Plante would have us believe.Worse, we are supposed to believe that the Commander is happy to continue with the relationship and become more deeply involved even after credible suspicions become apparent that he might be responsible for two recent murders? Really?Question? If our killer was really so worried about being caught out that he needed to construct such a pair of amazingly complex alibis in advance of the killings (as was revealed towards the end), wouldn't it have been a whole lot easier if he'd simply changed his method of killing so he wasn't the obvious suspect as the method was the ONLY thing that connected him to the murders? With someone of our boy's obvious intelligence, you would have thought that might have occurred to him. It obviously never occurred to La Plante though.I kept hoping for a twist in the plot that would lead us to a credible ending. No such luck. When both of us concluded that there was no possible way Blake could survive being caught in the relationship at the end without being chucked off the force for gross incompetence, that ends up not being the case at all.

403,631405,2003-07-18,FlorisV,Solaris (2002),,"This movie has an annoying, sluggish, artsy pace reminiscent of Kubrick's space turd called 2001: A Space Oddissey. Fortunately, it's slightly better. Instead of just raising questions what the hell the plot is all about, the movie is more about universal questions. The plot is more clear but there's still enough to make you guess. Is Solaris some sort of heaven were souls come back from? Is it a giant alien able to create hallucinations and read minds? What is death and what happens afterwards? Is there a god?The movie looks good and has overall fine acting. What I didn't like however was the offbeat, overly weird acting by the two male supporting actors. They were trying too hard to be different and were whispering the entire movie. It had this overly artsy feel to it like they desperately wanted to have as much weirdness in the film as possible. I would say it is better to have more identifiable characters in a film, otherwise you estrange your audience. I guess Soderbergh is to blaim, a director willing to try anything can be faulty. However, I did like the female doctor and Clooney and the other actress were fine (sorry, names....). I'm not sure about the clinical style the movie has because it makes you care less about the characters and identify less with them, while their emotions have an enormous influence on their actions and inactions in this story.So, there's plenty of flaws to this film. Still, I liked part of it. I love SciFi in general and this is true SciFi, I also liked the visuals, and the ideas behind the story. The movie is worth discussing afterwards, especially the end will have you wondering...what happened? I thought Clooney was not Clooney anymore but a ""clone"" created by Solaris. That would explain him feeling unfamiliar with earth when he came back. As for a more universal theme the film raises questions like is there an afterlife and what does it look like? Like one of the characters says there's no answers, only choices.In the making of, James Cameron stated you won't see a movie like this in the 70s, 80s, 90s or in the near future. He looked kind of angry too, probably feeling people underrated this film. Tho I would agree Solaris has a unique quality I still think it was a bit of an arrogant statement of Cameron, as much as I admire his work. I think, if you look well enough, you'll find plenty of thoughtprovoking, intelligent, offbeat and non-action scifi out there, like Silent Running, Logan's Run (70s), Brazil (80s) and Dark City (90s). And the original Solaris was a 70s film as well, I haven't seen it so I can't tell if it's that different.Overall, still an interesting one to watch. 7 out of 10.",472,0,,0,"No reference.

There's also the ones that can do both at the same time (Nightmare on Elm Street). This is one of the funny ones and before you start critiquing it, you have to realize that. With that statement in mind, this movie is great. Vilmer's remote controlled leg is probably the funniest of all. Many laughs are produced off of that one. And then there's strange old Leatherface. When the victims and that cuckoo torturous family get together, you are talking pure enjoyment that has got to be fun for whole family 15 and above.

I liked Robin Williams in the role and I thought he had some very hilarious lines, I don't think the script is week at all because I found myself laughing and even crying sometimes at some of the hilarious lines of dialogue. Cheryl Hines is funny as well here, and also I'd like to give a big shout out to Kristen Chenoweth, I think she brought some really good energy and funniness to the movie. Kristen's character had a lot of physical humor with her jiggling breasts, and also just her persona and the way she says things. JoJo is very impressive and funny here as the very sarcastic and kinda smart ass daughter. I also really liked Josh Hutcherson here, he showed that he had the both dramatic and comedic acting jobs. Now why am I giving this movie a six? I think it's because it's true that some of the movie does drag and through the middle of the film it gets a little bit boring at times. Will Arnett got on my nerves too, he wasn't funny or even mildly amusing in his character, I think that was a bad casting decision to cast Will. I also really liked Hunter Parrish, he was cute, funny and very charming, especially with the teenage daughter Cassie. Now as far as family entertainment goes, no, this is not the best movie to pick, but it certainly isn't a flop.

407,2501379,2013-07-31,lathe-of-heaven,Kingdom Hospital (2004),3.0,"Sorry, I normally don't go out of my way to post overly negative reviews, but being that the original Danish story was a bit of a minor Classic and also that Stephen King HIMSELF wrote the screenplay for this one, my expectations were a bit more than usual.The deal is, that I have come to the point where I just cannot STAND Stephen King's writing anymore. I LOVED his early stuff, but it seems like as years go by and maybe I'll try either to read a newer book by him or in this case try to watch a movie / series that he has written. And, it always is the same. The characters (which USED to be his strong point long, LONG ago) are bloody ALWAYS the same. Transparent, shallow, self-serving @ssholes, especially ANY authority figures.In addition to that and bearing more on this show here, I just found the voice-over INCREDIBLY stupid and distracting to what COULD have been maybe a decent story. ***VERY MINOR SPOILERS*** Right at the beginning when there is a cool shot of the black bird sitting on the guy, good ol' Stephen couldn't just let us squirm with the suspense of seeing the guy lying there, not able to move, and this carrion bird sitting on his chest. For God's frigg'n sake! Just LEAVE it! That would have been just perfectly fine because then the audience would be increasingly worried and on the edge of their seats to see what happens. But NOOOOOOOOOO... Not good enough for ol' Smart@ss Steve. Nope, he's gotta have this totally INANE voice-over like the bird is talking or something, and he says, 'mmmm, looks tasty. I think I'll start with the eyes' Are you frigg'n KIDDING me!??? Talk about horrendously stupid. And from there it is just more of the same. for another example, instead of just showing us maybe vague, ghostly half-seen images of the little girl, they bloody well put her full on the screen for a few seconds, looking right at you. And then this incredibly IDIOTIC voice-over comes in and says something unbelievably moronic like 'That is the one you will have to keep your eye on', or some such bloody nonsense.***END SPOILERSI guess what the bottom line is here is that, as the audience, you feel SO damn insulted that all these 'cute' lines and crap are put in there and it's like you are increasingly getting more and more frustrated, and finally yell out, ""Just get on with the DAMN story and LEAVE OUT all the crappy cute dialog for God's sake!!!""Just bloody AWFUL!And, it is not that I just don't like remakes, because the 2004 version of Stephen King's 'SALEM'S LOT' is actually pretty good.Maybe it's just me and my personal taste. If YOU happen to like your Horror with all these inane and cute voice-overs and constant 'wink winks' at the audience, then by all means go for it. Others here have apparently liked it and most likely appreciate Stephen King much more than I do. So, I don't know... For ME, it was God-Awful.

409,3386477,2017-09-11,darbski,"Gunsmoke: Jayhawkers (1959) Season 4, Episode 21",10.0,"**SPOILERS** ""The good die young"" is the quote that seems to fit, here. Phil Jacks was a good man, who ingratiated Chester and Matt as he was asking them to ride back to the herd Dolph Quince, he, and other Texans were driving up to Dodge. There seems to be a little misunderstanding about the distance involved. As I understand it, it was five day's ride FROM the herd to Dodge. well, they still had to ride back to the herd, didn't they? so let's see if we can give a little understanding to the timing, here.First, Jacks had to ride north, and let's say it was a total of five day's ride to get there. He had to have not just his normal mount, but a pack mount that could also double as a second riding mount. You MUST rest your horses. If you get forty miles a day, that's some real distance. That's because, you have to take breaks, water (Yeah, WATER - the stuff you AND your horse; your best friend, need), and rest your horses, and yourself, and you have to take supplies with you; food, water - again, at least to or three canteens full; probably at least a half tent, coffee, cooking gear, fire equipment, and other things that are necessary. Jacks gets to Dodge, he's gonna wanna re-stock his food and coffee supplies, get some shuteye, a good meal, and a good breakfast the next day, He'll probably wanna trade horses for fresh ones, and let's not forget that Matt and Chester need the same things.They start out the next morning, rested and ready. If I was Matt, I'd make Jacks sleep in the jail, and not get out partying. NOW, they have probably about how many days left? Well, if memory serves, Jacks rode about 200 miles to get to Dodge, didn't he? If he rode 40 miles a day for five days; well, yup, that figgers, don't it? NOPE. How about if he rode five days out? 200 miles? , yeahhhhhh..NOPE.Let's just say he rode about thirty a day, saved his horses, and rode five days up to Dodge from the South Kansas border. THAT'S much more believable. Of course, we must also consider the fact that they are driving cattle. If you get six miles a day out of your herd, that's good distance. All the other stuff applies, though. So, five days up to Dodge, figure a day of rest and re-supply, and back down would be about four days, or nine days total riding.Nobody remembers about the trail, or pack horse, but if you're riding a distance, you absolutely want to split up the weight between your mounts. They are life and death (literally) on the prairie. I know, it's only guesswork, because there are always unexpected things that slow you down. The Jayhawkers got their just desserts, and it was sad to see a good Man like Jacks get killed. If I'm thinking' right, The cowboys dug down about a foot, stripped those 'Hawkers, and opened their bellies, so the buzzards and coyotes would clean them up, and then threw some dirt on top of them; just so's they could say they buried them. Matt did the killin'; he gets the guns and saddles.I was surprised and happy to see Ken Curtis in this one, and prodding and kidding Dennis Weaver; them turning into friends. Jack Elam in younger days when he was properly fence rail tough was a real revelation, wasn't it?? Very good episode.",589,0,,0,"No reference.

410,1225760,2006-06-22,slokes,Diggstown (1992),7.0,"James Woods went through a period, he later told Cigar Aficionado magazine, where all he did in movies was play ""hard guys in suits."" ""Diggstown"" is a classic example, yet a welcome relief, too, in the sense for once Woods wasn't taking himself at all seriously.Woods is Gabriel Caine, a former dealer in phony art who is sprung from prison and hatches a scheme to take in John Gillon, the vicious boss of Diggstown, played by Bruce Dern. After Caine's buddy, Fitz (Oliver Platt), hustles Gillon's son out of his classic Corvette, Fitz and Caine give Gillon a chance to win it back by wagering a fighter named Honey Roy Palmer (Louis Gossett Jr.) can outbox any ten Diggstown men in a day.While a buddy movie of a kind, most of the focus is on Woods' performance, delivered with his usual array of tics, smirky grins, long hooded stares, etc. It's easy to be cool when you know what the next line is in the script, but screenwriter Steven McKay's wit and way of winking at the audience keeps things from getting too stale.Confronted by a warden about a prisoner escape Caine engineered: ""The important thing is not to take this as a rejection of you personally.""Or how about when a hood puts a noose around Caine's neck and hoists him from a tree limb, saying it will be a pleasure to kill him. Would you be ruffled? Me, too. Not Caine: ""I'll bet four dollars against an hour with your mother that it won't happen."" After he's punched in the gut, Caine apologizes. ""I'm really sorry. That was insulting. Five bucks.""Ultimately, ""Diggstown"" is a con movie where the audience is being conned. Like ""The Sting,"" we are given some information but a few surprises along the way, which are turned with varying degrees of skill. Unlike ""The Sting,"" ""Diggstown"" suffers from many implausible moments, a painfully weak finale, and out-of-thin-air subplots that go nowhere, especially one involving Heather Graham, who kills you with those eyes so much you almost overlook how bad her performance is. Platt, a terrific actor who never seems to find a worthy project, has a great introduction and then largely fades from view.But what you get is more good than bad, and at times brilliant, especially when Honey Roy has his day in the ring with the Diggstown Ten. It's a memorably directed sequence by Michael Ritchie, alternately harrowing and hilarious, with Gossett a pillar of strength whether his opponent is a guy named Hammerhead or some palooka he needs to carry long enough for Fitz to milk the crowd with side bets.""You're the one that kept drilling me that half the money's in the acting,"" Honey Roy tells Caine.Actually, all the money's in the acting in ""Diggstown,"" but Woods, Gossett, Platt, and Dern are more than enough to compensate for the inanities that sometimes crop up around them.

412,2180100,2011-09-18,chaos-rampant,"Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler (1922)",,"I really urge you to watch this, but watch beyond the caper, watch the character beyond the simply nefarious evil mastermind that he appears as, and you'll be stunned with the the complexity of forces at work; at the center is a man who - having mastered the mind - can guide vision into shaping worlds and, from the inverse point-of-view of the unwitting victims, the shaped world as the stage of some indecipherable, chaotic spiel.So what this really is, is the precursor of film noir. The genre as later assumed by American hands - once Germans fled there - transferred Mabuse out of sight, but the fundamental movement remains: we had to assume the notion that somewhere, on a cosmic station above, the images that down here formed reality were being controlled and manipulated. What the protagonists in these films experienced as a world of fertile, opportunous chaos, and would therefore exploit to their own advantage, was eventually revealed to be a chimera of the mind led astray; the world was being supervised and kept in ledgers all along.This is pretty amazing stuff to have then; we can see the manipulator inside the manipulated world, and the motions that bring consequences on both ends of the illusion. The first scene shows Mabuse dealing cards with on them the faces of the players, the actors who are about to perform in the orchestrated fiction - Mabuse's inside the film, and also Lang's film about Mabuse. And there is a woman who is our surrogate viewer in all this; she watches the gamblers from a distance, searching faces for thrills and sensations. All this touches at the heart of self-referential cinema in ways that still astound by how erudite, how in-sightful. Viewers who are looking for films about the mind weaving films will be delighted. There is one scene that will be absolutely unequaled in film until the second great cinema of Resnais and Tarkovsky some forty years later. It shows Mabuse operating an illusion on stage before a packed theater; the entire audience watches transfixed at people magically walking out of a screen into the middle of the auditorium - and vanishing at a snap of the fingers - none of them realizing the confrontation that is actually playing out within the fantasy.But there is an extra layer that further elevates this. So what is perceived by the players as unluck or the chance turn of a card, from our double perspective rooted in Mabuse's mind is revealed as part of the same, decisive plan. Yet Mabuse is not a godlike presence, he is steeped in human passions; icy but on occasion petulant, seething, lusting, the mask full of emotional cracks.So, on one level we have a controlled reality as a puppet show of absurdities, but on the other end finally we get a glimpse of the mind cracking under the weight of what it must control, under the burden of the operated illusion. The final vision is a nightmare where these controlled images animate themselves against their tyrant. Tellingly it happens in a locked room; the blind people that were tasked by Mabuse to deal with his fortunes, in fact his counterfeit fortunes, now transform into apparitions of guilt.Few films have so deeply influenced our cinematic vision, from Vertigo to Lynch. It has been since disguised and embellished, but it's revealed here for the first time.",567,0,,0,"No reference.

Thanks largely to the deft but light hand of director Hal Ashby and a well modulated performance from David Carradine, the film manages to get its ideas across without seeming sentimental or cloying.Guthrie has a complicated relationship with his wife (Melinda Dillon) and forms close friendships with strange men (and women) everywhere he goes. One of his closest friends is Ozark Bule (Ronny Cox), a semi-successful folkie who brings Guthrie along to the radio station and inspires him to help with the union, but who balks at Guthrie's extreme sense of anti-commercialism. The film overall does a pretty good job of showing how Guthrie had some real weaknesses, and that his anti-authoritarian stance wasn't just a case of righteousness but more one of personal conviction.Haskell Wexler's photography should be applauded, because the film's slow pace allows us to drink in the beauty of so many landscapes and dustbowl worker's camps. The musical selections are excellent. I only wish the film could have gone on longer, and showed us some of his real success that led to him becoming world-famous.

When I first saw the trailers for this and I checked it on my watchlist, I thought I was checking an action-packed movie with somewhat competent performances, a plot revolving on honor and all that knight's/warrior's code. Well, the first is kind of true not truly. The second is not and the third, well, the third is the whole plot of the movie. Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman, fine damn actors. Owen is slightly above average on this one, playing at first a a badass warrior, then changing into a decadent man and ending with the badass again. Freeman, well, what can I say about Freeman? It's not that I didn't like his performance, but I also didn't love it. Its just for the paycheck,nothing more. Clive was certainly the best of the movie altogether with the other knight's of the Seventh Rank. In spite of casting a good lead, a credible master, and somewhat competent warriors, the production just went off the track with the rest of the cast, with the exception of Ayelet Zurer as Naomi which I quite liked. Let's get to it, shall we?I want to see ""Headhunters"", I do, but after seeing what Aksel Hennie delivered in this one, I'm frightened. He plays the main villain and if you play the villain you can make some abuses. But well, this guy is,in my opinion, worse than Nicolas Cage on his outbursts. The only thing he does throughout the whole film is over-bloody-acting! I didn't feel anything for his character, I just wanted it to stay off-screen. It was, bad, really shameful, cringeworthy. The rest of the cast it's just a poor mix of not that great actors.The film only shines on the action sequences. It starts well, with some skirmish but then you have to wait about an hour and ten minutes for the next draw of swords. It just drags. Gratefully, these scenes are well shot and edited and realist and I think that most of the actors did their stunt work, specially Owen. ""Last Knights"" is only enjoyable on the fight scenes.

Since it's barely futuristic at all, I'd say it's more appropriate to refer to it as an alternate reality than merely something set years from now. In it, time is the only currency(and this point is hammered home... one thing is that the word replaces the word ""money"", but there are painful puns on that, where the meaning of common phrases are turned into something else, such as how here, ""do you have a minute"" is the equivalent to ""spare some change"". The points made are great, the communication could sometimes use some work. Niccol's biggest flaw is that he tends to overwrite scripts when he has something to say, and the conveying gradually loses subtlety... with that said, there are bits where it is spot-on, and the ending of this is fantastic), you do not age beyond 25(leading to a world where most people are supermodels... to be fair, the film itself does poke fun at this aspect) at which moment your life will only have one additional year, and you can now earn more by labor(and don't expect to be able to pay debts, taxes and the like and have much at all left for yourself or your family). The metaphor is entirely clear, and not only does this this fit nearly perfectly with the current Occupy movement, some of the better of the plenty of good, quotable dialog in this lends itself to slogans for it. Our hero does go on to fight the wealthy elite, who do not enjoy their lives because they're worried about losing what they have, so they take no chances. Some of the logic and consistency is a tad iffy. He is joined by rich girl wanting to break free from her sheltered existence, Sylvia(Seyfried), and they do the Robin Hood thing. While the inclusion of a romance between the two is predictable, the execution isn't bad. The characters are memorable and their arcs tend to be convincing. This has some of the shallow Hollywood standards going, with the poor being largely honorable and doing little wrong(if it does admit that a lot of crime happens in the ghetto... however, this feels like it's blaming those in power for creating that situation, which is true a lot of the way... still, no one is that black and white), and, well, you can guess how the other side is portrayed. I like that our main cop, Leon(Murphy), is clearly a person of integrity, he's not drunk on power. The acting is impressive. This is the first thing I see Justin in, and I would like to see other movies starring him. Though the action is somewhat derivative and uninspired not to mention in very brief stints(Andrew is not comfortable with the genre, and I support him sticking with what he does well, see what immediately follows this parenthesis), this gets quite intense. There is a little moderate language(one strong, as per what the PG-13 rating allows... and it's placed so well), mild violence and somewhat disturbing sights(when your clock runs out, you collapse from a heart attack) in this. I recommend this to anyone who cares about the current political and financial situation, as well as fans of thought-provoking thrillers. 7/10",546,0,,0,"No reference.

When I heard that Danny Boyle directed ""The Beach"", I wanted to see it, because I absolutely love his films. And, after all, the Beach was a well shot movie with good scenes and so, but... well... many points and the whole meaning of the book were taken away. For example: The second lead role (a hippy with a long beard) was taken out completely. Maybe, because the scenes he was featured in were too violent or disgusting (especially the ending that was completely changed) for a Hollywood film, and Sal, who was described a bit like Drew Barrymore (friendly, big, attractive and calm), the real opposite of her film-character, became the really worst villain in film history.

There are many bad points in ""the Beach"", but I can't tell them all. But what annoyed me the most was the ending: The original one had to do with hate, paranoia, trust and even racism and gives you this ""alone"" feeling. The ending in the movie was too... happy. ""Everything's okay, all in the right place again..."" and so on. Also, the brilliant dream sequences who came after every chapter were taken out... also because of violence...

""The Beach"" tries to be a good story, a PG-13 version of the book, but is still too far away from a teen movie, making it look like a childish mixture-version of ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Apocalypse Now!"". Read the novel, it is BRILLIANT!!!!

It had a huge amount of suspense, keeping you at the edge of your seat practically the whole movie. It was a great change for a movie with a mass murder. Instead of the boring classic of a person killing with guns or fists, they spruce it up to a more interesting matter. The acting was fantastic although the F word could have been a little bit used less. It also had some humor as well. My favorite scene was in the court room, where the judge was getting completely owned. I would highly recommend this movie. now lets go to the ending which quite a few people seemed to dislike. I enjoyed the ending quite well. I don't know what people's opinion of a ""classic Hollywood ending"" is. But i don't think this was one of them. It ended fairly abrupt, but if it got too much longer, people would be complaining about the length instead of the ending. What i find quite amusing is people are whining about the ending, but they don't supply viewers with their opinion of what to change about it. What do you want to happen? - have the criminal blow up the people and the movie go on for another hour with people trying to prove him guilty? and if so, how do you expect the authorities to grip proof it was him? would you allow more people to die instead of having the mass murderer get a taste of his own medicine? I think the ending was very well played out and if people are going to criticize it they should supply viewers with what they would change. Everyone is allowed to have their own opinion, but should back it up with more than saying, ""it ended quickly.""OK. this movie was incredible and i highly recommend it to anyone that doesn't get offended with violence or vulgar language.

Is it a groundbreaking horror that trucks convention? That'll be a big 'no'. But is it fun? Well, I thought so. It's cheesy, sleazy, and occasionally gory, with that unmistakable '80s vibe that makes even a bad movie entertaining.Pretty teen Robin Adams (Sullivan Hester, in her one and only movie) leaves her father's Xmas get-together to drive to a more lively party with her pal Monica (Laura Kallison). On the way, the girls are stopped and taken hostage by three criminals on the run from a local penitentiary: Louis 'Face' Napoleon (Alex Kubik), Mongo (Michael Nash) and Randy 'Hotrod' Carter (Mark Witsken), who was forced to take part in the escape by his ruthless cellmates.In order to avoid a roadblock, Randy steers the car down a country lane that leads to an old deserted mine. Driving over a disused shaft, the car plummets into the ground, where the survivors come face-to-face with a deranged cannibal. Investigating the area, Sheriff Billy Williams (Randy Powell) follows the criminals and their hostages into the mine but isn't prepared for the horrors that await.This one was apparently shelved for five years before finally seeing the light of day (in 1993), but it isn't any worse than many similar films from that era, and definitely better than quite a few. The plot is routine and the dialogue predictable, but the cast put in decent performances given what they have to work with. Alex Kubik is particularly great as slimy child-killer Face, the actor hamming it up a treat at every opportunity. Kudos also to Elizabeth Kent as Rachel, the strange woman who lives in the old pay office above the mine: her show-stopping speech at the end of the film is an audacious exercise in over-acting that is a marvel to behold. At the other end of the scale, Cameron 'never one to turn down a gig' Mitchell sleepwalks through his role as Robin's father, the movie sporadically cutting to the concerned old man to justify the actor's star billing.Mitchell's scenes aside, director Leszek Burzynski keeps the brace brisk, and whenever things threaten to drag, he throws in something trashy to keep the viewer entertained, whether it be a some gratuitous nudity (during a hilarious impromptu sex scene, and when Face forces Monica to strip for him), some gore (the discovery of the half-eaten remains of Mongo being the most grisly moment, made all the more revolting when Randy has to fish his torch out of the dead man's innards), or having his lead actress strip to her underwear to take an underwater swim (granny pants alert!).6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for crazy Rachel's mine-related sexy talk: ""You go down.... down... until you find a shaft.""",471,0,,0,No reference.

(Kopa fans...Be warned for this one)😑your joking...Really?look,I like the idea of Simba and Nala having a son but that would be to much like the original,Plus,Kopa wasn't a Disney creation!Some people might know this already,He was created by a outside company wanting to pitch in on the fame and fortune on the lion king franchise!And while in a interview with the creators behind the lion king 2 they said very bluntly,They didn't even know kopa existed!And maybe if they knew he was around,they would've contacted his creators and had him in the movie!But that didn't happen...So for those complaining where this cub is,Despite how many facts,Theories,And explanations you come up with,he never existed,The creators of this film didn't know he existed,Get over it!(sorry kopa lovers)Overall,this movie is great!i think out of all the Romeo and Juliet cartoon movies I've seen,I think this is the best out of all of them!Despite the minor flaws,It has memorable characters,A ambitious villain,Catchy songs,and lives up to the original movie!I highly recommend giving it a try!Im positive you'll love it!Maybe even more than the first film!😉",418,1,why do numerous people hate it,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Johnny Depp again transfigures himself into another quirky yet endearing character: a dyslexic young man who channels his shyness through his jaw-dropping imitations of Buster Keaton, and finds his soul mate in Joon, a girl who suffers from a mental illness, maybe schizophrenia. She cannot get along with anyone besides her protective brother Benny, as she is prone to panic attacks at the slightest provocation, which includes the former housekeeper having smelly hair. But throughout the film, we see, as Depp's Sam sees, that despite her mental illness she is a strong-willed, bright, and beautiful individual who may be more independent than her brother presumes. Not that Benny is an overbearing hover-copter; we see how concerned he is for her happiness and well-being, sacrificing his freedom and romantic pursuits to give her the best care possible. You can't help admiring him (his good looks and steadfast love for his sister) and wishing he were your older brother. All three characters are marvelously portrayed, and the plot, though somewhat predictable and cheesy, ends in such a hilarious and sweet note that it makes the whole movie experience delightful.

She declines, but they continue to meet for occasional resumptions of their physical relationship over a seventeen year period despite the fact he now has a wife and daughter.The film rapidly becomes a Japanese equivalent of 'Back Street', in which Okada belies her early charmingly robust initial persona by becoming more and more morbidly obsessed with Nagato, who foolishly persists with their affair, despite it plainly taking an increasingly unhealthy turn. The film builds to a melodramatic conclusion that takes place in 1962, the same year Wong Kar-wai's 'In the Mood for Love' commences. Both films look wonderful, but while Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung's relationship in the latter is close but never consummated, that between Okada and Nagato continues to be physical yet rashly one-sided, with consequences as devastating as they are foreseeable to anyone except Nagato.",215,0,,0,"No reference.

462,4791997,2020-03-18,Mnemosyne15,Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),8.0,"One of the reasons why film thinking is different from other artistic thinking is that film does not need to be described, and it does not need to be processed by other media and communication methods. The camera can directly and completely record this complete space and movement in space, but literature must describe It is the same with all kinds of details, sculpture, and fine arts. Only the movie is closer to the original reality, and the movie is closer to life. He can really show the details of life directly. This is why Bazan said that film art does not imitate reality, but reality imitates film. What he meant was that film directly created reality, which also led to different ways of thinking between film and literature, film processing and literary processing It's quite different. Film only intercepts and does not need to describe encoding and conversion. What about literature? If you are interested, you can think about how to use the lens to express the scene of the rice dumplings I described earlier, how to express it in words, and see if the way of thinking is different.
Furthermore, in terms of authenticity, films are also fictional, but they are also fictional. Films have a closer life-like realism, repainting and painting, sculptures are made more lifelike, and literary depiction is not as immersive as realism. The movie is closer to reality, although everyone is fake. Of course, this is only more realistic, and authenticity is not the sole purpose of art.",254,0,,0,"No reference.

Once again Charlie Kaufman takes the kernel of a great idea and overloads it with his own obsessive personality. The idea of a couple fighting to retain beautiful memories of their past together while undergoing a memory erasure is ingenious. Kaufman definitely hits some poignant notes along the way (he's great at communicating the mundane pleasures and comforts of relationships), but Joel and Clementine's characters seem like mere sketches rather than fully developed people that the audience can care about. Joel in particular is maddening because he's the same schlubby protagonist that is in all of Kaufman's scripts: it's Charlie himself. The man is simply incapable of creating characters outside the bounds of his own personality. Also, the movie isn't as enjoyable as it should be. Though I wanted to see how it ended (even though I predicted the plot twist about 30 minutes into the movie), Kaufman denies the audience the pleasures of human connection with the characters in favor of convoluted, intricately distanced storytelling. The characters come across as rats in an experiment or pawns in a chess game or any other omniscient metaphor you can think of. And the subplot between the workers of Lunaca fits but in an unimaginative, convenient way. I must say that all of the performances were excellent (except Elijah Wood, but he didn't have much of a character anyway), particularly Winslet and Mark Ruffalo. Director Michel Gondry and his team of technicians give the movie an appropriately jittery, jagged rhythm and look. It feels like the work of a writer on anti-depressants and Valium filtered through the mind of a director on a 3-day caffeine binge. That's not necessarily a bad thing because without the energy and gimmickry that Gondry brings to the film, the emptiness of the conception would be all the more glaring. Don't believe the hype but don't discount the film altogether either. It seems that many people are discovering something profound in it.

464,5004388,2020-06-06,dr_clarke_2,Driving Miss Daisy (1989),8.0,"Bruce Beresford's 1989 Academy Award for Best Picture winner Driving Miss Daisy is basically a film about a rich Jewish widow gradually befriending her black driver. And that, in a nutshell, is it. But it was so well received and has endured so well for the simple reason that it's impeccably made and a joy to watch.
The story unfolds in an entirely predictable fashion, as the titular Miss Daisy Werthan crashes her car, prompting her son Boolie to insist on employing a driver for her in the shape of Hoke Colburn. She's not at all happy about this and even when she capitulates it takes her a long time to accept what she sees as Hoke's unwanted intrusion into her life; inevitably however, she grows to both respect and like him and they eventually form a touching friendship. None of this is Earth-shattering stuff, but it is compelling because the characters are so believably written and because the actors are so perfectly cast.
Jessica Tandy's Daisy is a lovely character, proud, stubborn and a bit eccentric. Morgan Freeman's Hoke is just as stubborn in his own way, gradually convincing Daisy to let him drive her through sheer persistence - he later tells Boolie ""It only took me six days, same time it took the Lord to make the world!"" She proves to be a terrible back-seat driver, finding fault with Hoke right up until she nearly accuses Hoke of stealing a tin of salmon, until he tells her that he ate it and has bought a replacement. It's a key moment in their relationship, but it's so subtle that it's easy to miss. From this moment on, Daisy becomes much warmer towards her new companion, as demonstrated by the lovely scene in the cemetery when he says he can't read and she teaches him on the spot on the basis that he at least knows the alphabet.
The remainder of the film charts their friendship, and like the tinned salmon moment, it is often very subtle. The dynamic between them changes in small increments, such as when Hoke firmly insists that if he needs to stop the car to use the toilet, then he will do whether Daisy likes it or not. Fiction meets real life when Miss Daisy goes to a dinner attended by Martin Luther King; Boolie suggests she take Hoke, but she makes a mess of inviting him, resulting in him angrily waiting outside and listening to the speech on the car radio. Later, as Miss Daisy develops dementia (Tandy giving a remarkably realistic performance), Hoke is ably to calm her down and the final scene is very poignant, as he visits her in a nursing home and helps her to eat her Thanksgiving pie.
There are other themes here too, most notably racism, which is handled with just as much subtlety as everything else: the Alabama policemen calling Hoke ""boy"" and demanding to know what he's doing with an expensive car is quietly understated, without detracting from its profoundly offensive nature. The synagogue bombing that draws parallels between the racism that Hoke experiences and anti-Semitism occurs off screen and Hoke learns of it from a policeman. It's that sort of film, in which everything of importance is relayed through dialogue.
Bruce Beresford is not a flashy director. That's probably why he didn't get a Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards, even though the film won Best Picture. But he has the workmanlike approach of an artisan, and he's content to let the performances drive the film. Peter James' cinematography is equal straightforward and therein lies its elegance, for example when close-ups of blossom are used to indicate the passage of time. The make-up used to age the characters is very impressive, and mention should also be made of Dan Ackroyd's supporting performance as Boolie, which is overshadowed only because Tandy and Freeman are so very good. The only aspect of the film that has aged badly is Hans Zimmer's score, performed electronically, which is a bit of an unwanted earworm. Overall, Driving Miss Daisy is one of the more modest Oscar winning movies, but it has lashings of charm and is deserving of its reputation as a modern classic.",705,0,,0,"No reference.

The couple plans to move up to the state capitol of Albany, where Ms. Russell wants to keep house and have Mr. Bellamy's children. Russell rejects Mr. Grant's offer to re-marry and remain a reporter. Sensing Russell really loves him and wants to continue her assignments, Grant maneuvers to have her cover the recent shooting of a ""colored"" policeman, by troubled bookkeeper John Qualen (as Earl Williams)...This re-make of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's ""The Front Page"" most notably swaps the gender of the roles played by Russell and Bellamy, which gives everything a lift. Russell plays a strong ""Hildy"" but succumbs to some stereotypes by the end; still, we believe she will manage to asset herself in the future. The pace is breakneck and the script fast, with overlapping dialogue spilling out of the newsroom. Double-takes include the ""pickaninny"" story (carried over from the original) and the way Bellamy's character is described by Grant, ""He looks like that fellow in the movies - Ralph Bellamy.""

The film seems to have bi-polar disorder, switching from a happy violence, almost farcical comedy to heavy drama between (or sometimes even within) scenes. The dramatic elements were generally the most watchable parts of the movie -- at points we even feel some sympathy for the main character's plight. The comedic elements, on the other hand, seemed out of place, and way too far over the top to be actually funny, generally relying on something to be funny so long as it is shocking. Note to Hollywood: shock tactics only go so far. At some point you have to insert something which is actually funny outside of just being disgusting.As far as acting goes, most of it was BAD. Matt Dillon does his usual impression of a robot, backed up by Steve Zahn playing a completely unsympathetic manic asshole. The rest of the supporting cast is generally better than those two, but no performances stand out enough to warrant discussion.Then come the obligatory surprise endings. Yes, endings plural. I remember being willing to forgive the movie for its sins and say that I liked it and found it reasonably entertaining and thoughtful (maybe as high as 7 stars), but then we go to surprise ending number one. Then there's another, and another, until nothing could be less surprising than another surprise ending.

469,1096587,2005-12-27,bob the moo,Dead Ringers (2002–2007),,"Beginning life on Radio 4, this show first came to my attention because John Culshaw used to be a regular on the Chris Moyles radio show back when I used to think he was worth listening to. At first glance it didn't really appeal to me because I was expecting something a lot more like Bremner, Bird & Fortune, by which I mean I was hoping it would be cleverer, sharper and not necessarily the sort of funny that makes you laugh but occasionally the uneasy feeling that the latter show can give you. However a few more viewings and I settled down into acceptance that Dead Ringers is not in the same arena as BB&F and that this is not necessarily a problem.DR tends not to be as sharp because it isn't really a satirical show (although it can be), it is more of a straight comedy show (although not totally to the degree of, say, Alistair McGowan). This mix of populist and political works quite well and produces some very good scenes with a good hit/miss ratio. It isn't always the smartest game in town but it makes for it by being roundly entertaining. It rarely has a point to make but rather just takes aims at public figures with general mockery. Hence we get things like Andrew Marr with his fantastically out-of-control arms or the simply dumb George Bush; it is rarely insightful but it works.The performers are all pretty talented and, although the visuals aren't always great, the voices are normally spot on. Culshaw relies a bit too heavily on the old stalwarts of Dr Who and Obi-Wan, but generally he is very good although I do get the impression that the general comic approach of the material is down to his influence. Ravens is usually the one that looks least like any of the people she is impersonating but she does get the voices really on target to compensate; with fewer females in target positions, she tends to take more of a support role at times but she is generally good. Cornwell isn't a great impressionist but he is very close and he has good delivery, Connelly is equally as good and Perry is good in most, if not all, of his roles.Overall this isn't a clever show or the satirical impressions that I've grown used to with BB&F but instead Dead Ringers is more generally amusing. Mocking and poking fun rather than being sharp and incisive puts it below BB&F in my book (despite actually being funnier) but for the majority of viewers this will do the job. A bit broad for my tastes but generally funny and entertaining.",445,0,,0,"No reference.

A wonder that Hollywood finally managed to create an intelligent, funny, emotional, esoterical, mysterious, philosophicalin short an all covering film that is really touching. In the first, somewhat overlong half the story is following the main hero Truman through his point of view and elaborating his quiet, normal life while the director Peter Weir is cleverly choosing strange camera angles to give the feeling as if he is being spy-ed by someone. In the second, and much more intriguing part, the story shifts to the outside"" world and to Christof's 10 mile wide studio from which Truman is being monitored by 5.000 cameras 24 hours a day for a TV show.--------------------- The themes of this sci-fi tragicomedy are quite fascinating existential ( finding out who we are and stopping anyone who wants to control our life ), philosophical ( what is real and what not? ) and even subversive ( the media changed the world so much that even a lie can pass as truth ). One of the best scenes is the one where Christof touches the sleeping Truman on the screen at night, creating a strange feeling how he is present in his life although he never met him!""The Truman Show"" deservedly won 3 Golden Globes for best score, main actor Jim Carrey and supporting actor Ed Harris, who was also nominated for an Oscar.Still, as much as I love it, I have to admit that the original shooting script by Andrew Niccol overshadows it. There we had a much more intimate storyline and original ideas. Some of the highlights there were that the location was New York (!), the scene where Truman accidentally discovers the word Trumanesque"" in the dictionary, the building of the fake town Sydney, Chloe's marching in into Christof's room and telling him that Truman didn't masturbate for 2 months, the dialog between a caller and Christof ( I enjoyed your work, Christof, but I can't say I saw all of it.""  Who can?"" ) or when Truman disguised himself while entering an xxx store all the while some two viewers had an ironic dialog ( What's with the disguise?""  Maybe he doesn't want to be recognized."" ). I can't understand why those scenes were deleted. True, the script ending is much weaker than the movie ending, but all in all it gives an better impression - and elaborates the plot more. It's sad because with that script this could have easily been even better.Grade: 9/10",435,0,,0,"No reference.

476,1604309,2008-03-11,Zaptharo,Sanford and Son (1972–1977),9.0,"Growing up in the 1980s and early 1990s, I had no intentions to think of any show before that era. It's not that I didn't like them, I just felt that the shows I grew up on were the best. A couple of years ago I grew weary of the state of television and decided to find something that would satisfy my taste buds. When I found Sanford & Son being aired on TV Land, I was surprised. I never knew beforehand that so many good sitcoms came out of the 1970s, and this is no exception.Originally based off of ""Steptoe & Son"", Sanford & Son revolves around a junk dealer and his son living in a neighborhood in Watts, Los Angeles. Fred Sanford (Redd Foxx) is a sarcastic and stubborn person who's plans usually backfire, causing trouble. His son Lamont Sanford (Demond Wilson) usually has to complete tasks and order his own father to complete jobs. It was very amusing to see the two argue against each other and have to become loyal in order for things to come back to normal.But there are a couple other interesting characters in the series worth mentioning. Aunt Esther (LaWanda Page), who is sister of Fred Sanford's late wife Elizabeth, is a Baptist who just can't seem to handle Fred too well. In most cases they spew insults to each other such as ""Gorilla Face"" and ""Fish-Eyed Fool"", and what makes this funny is that it never gets old. I always found myself laughing whenever Fred gave Aunt Esther a dirty joke. Grady Wilson (Whitman Mayo), who is Fred's closest friend, usually acts as his ""sidekick"" and is involved in get rich schemes. Unfortunately, Redd Foxx left the show for some episodes (due to a feud with the producers) and thus Grady had to fill in, in order to watch the junk yard business. Many characters appear in the show, and not one of them is really that boring to watch.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the classic sitcoms, well before Cable TV and Reality TV started getting out of hand. I consider the 1970s to be the ""Golden Age of Sitcoms,"" because that was when barriers were broken and actors displayed their best talents to make themselves stand out. All in the Family, M*A*S*H, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Happy Days, Good Times, The Jeffersons, Three's Company, Different Strokes, Taxi, and numerous others. Sanford & Son puts most of the 1990s and 2000s sitcoms to shame. It was a stroke of genius, and Redd Foxx was a one of a kind individual. No one beforehand thought a stand up comic would be good in his own show. But he did it, in a big way. It's still a hit among old and young generations alike, and if Sanford & Son still lives on even after over 35 years, then you know that it's a classic. Like Archie Bunker, Fred Sanford is a unique person.So don't waste your time watching the Disney Channel or anything that comes out of Reality TV. Sanford & Son is a timeless sitcom that will keep you laughing. Highly recommended.9 out of 10.",527,0,,0,"No reference.

I agree, there is a continuous decline in quality from the 1st to the 3rd installment.

And it does not get rendered exciting by her not knowing who is the father, the potentials being her married ex and a complete stranger from a drunken chance encounter...What REALLY lifted my eyebrow was the 43(!) year old pregnant woman who completely ignores the need for prenatal diagnostics (amniocenthesis) and NO ONE, including the gynecologist seems to be alarmed by this. Nor does she have any concern since she seems to lack any information about the possible outcomes (where we are again at the ""does she have any contact with reality"" context).

So much time is spent on/in Kryptonian settings that there were times I forgot this was a Superman movie. It also doesn't help that Zod's a lame bad guy. And that overwrought Zimmer score won't stop. And how do you completely remove the soul from Pa Kent? Who was that guy they got Costner to play?But it's still no ""Superman III"", and here's what they did right:Snyder's movie stands on its own, devoid of any chains to the Donner films (thought that'd never happen). They also delivered on the flying scenes, emphasizing Superman's power (and his smile when first taking to the skies is infectious), not to mention some majestic cape shots. And it's also a good cast, they just need some actual meat to work with. Which brings me to the movie's greatest strength: the man wearing the tights. Henry Cavill makes for a terrific Superman, charismatic, and boasting a physique to weep openly over. He's absolutely the reason I'd watch a sequel, and I cannot speak highly enough of Cavill's turn in the role.But this material shouldn't be so dark. They Nolanized it and made everything Batman serious. That's not Superman.

It's easy to dismiss a movie that tries a little too hard to make you cry. You meet the title character (Robin Williams), an unconventional med student who wants hospital patients to be seen as people and not numbers, and you may think, ""Ha, I know where this is going, and it's not going to suck me in."" Well, it got me. When we first meet Patch, he's in trouble. A difficult childhood resulted in a suicide attempt, and now he's in a mental hospital. He cures himself by helping the other patients and, upon his release, Patch decides to become a doctor. He spends his years in med school railing against the impersonal approaches of fellow students and teachers, bucking convention, angering the establishment and going to extremes to brighten the lives of countless patients. Some may cringe at the sight of Patch donning a clown nose, or using bed pans as shoes in a childen's cancer ward. Yes, it's a bit syrupy, but it's done with warmth, and that is the key to buying into the whole tale...which is based on a true story. Williams exudes warmth. This is a tailor-made role for his offbeat charm and zaniness and, unless you're a total ogre, you can't help but like him. How much of the role is the real Patch, and how much is Williams being Williams is anyone's guess, but he skillfully blends wacky antics and heartfelt emotions. Of course, most of Patch's classmates disagree with his unusual treatments. They come around in the end...you knew that, right? Despite such cliches, ""Patch Adams"" is, dare I say it, a ""feel good"" movie. Normally, that phrase is associated with lower level critics...the ones who take advantage of free food at studio screenings and never have a bad word to say about any movie...but I felt good after seeing ""Patch Adams,"" and I'm not ashamed to say I did get misty-eyed more than once.",342,0,,0,"No reference.

The scriptwriters use this technique a lot during this episode, and it is just irritating as the dickens. The desire to defend oneself is built in to honest people. Maybe they figured that people would accept the Japanese mind as being the opposite. To me, it didn't work. Also, all the ""know your place"" baloney may work out fine in family matters, but NOT in business. And this was all about business.Perry had to know, even before Tragg, that Kamuri's death was murder, because he asked about the red rug, and the robe. Why were the candles left burning after the police had come and gone? It was obviously someone in the Nichols house that was guilty after Alice admitted to framing Mitsou for theft, and then not having to courage and integrity to come forth about it when she saw what was happening because of it. I think they could have done a better job of making up Benson Fong for this part, or gotten an actual old guy to play the part; he was just not believable. This was makeup department's problem, brought about by casting. Fong is one of the greats, just not right for this part. I also think that since they were going to let the connection between Toma and Mitsou devolve into romance (gimme a break), the least they could do is have some inscrutable Japanese music playing in the background. You know, the kind that sound like psychedelic Ukeleles being played by Frank Zappa on acid??One thing I like about Perry, is the way they show how money (power) corrupts, and more money corrupts more people.

To me the Rathbone/Bruce Holmes films were the best adaptations of Conan Doyle's stories, mainly because although I've read all of them I'm not a Holmes Purist and I've always preferred treatments of any story for that matter to come from the Golden Age. That sounds pretty limiting, but life is short and there's still plenty out there to see and read! Personally Rathbone was definitive as Holmes, Jeremy Brett in the '80's/'90's on UK TV was a close second but the programmes even though set correctly lacked atmosphere and the film quality was often irritatingly grainy. Peter Cushing was good too, but brought a Hammy energy to the role I couldn't quite get used to.

Fox did a great job with this film, which proved to be 1/14, the production values were consistently high, and attention to period detail unwavering. Apart from reducing costs the fogs on the back lots, sorry Moors lent the right atmosphere to this version of the tale.

Ly's no-holds-barred direction makes sure that the tension is palpable, nail-biting & nerve-wracking and keeps the viewers alert & on the edge at all times.The plot addresses the ever-worsening relations between the cops & marginalised communities and derives its restless vibe from the animosity within various groups in the neighbourhood that the police keep walking into. Adding more fuel to the fire is the dynamic camerawork, cut-throat editing & fiery performances, and it all ends on a brutal but thought-provoking note.Overall, Les Misérables is as combustible as it is captivating in its depiction of how even a petty act can get out of hand and spiral into the threat of a large crisis.

If one chooses to go ahead with the crime without regards to the outcome, then it is said the devil will have his revenge in due time. The author of the book (George Arnaud), "" Wages of Fear "" said as much in his original work. If you read the novel, you begin to realize there are a couple of organizations in the real world who might have been created by the devil. The two are The Mob and the second is the F.B.I. With the help of Inter-Pol (International Police) anyone who makes their most wanted list will never be able to hide anywhere in the world. The second and more sinister organization is The Mafia. Commit a crime against them and its said 'you can run, but you cannot hide' from them. This basis is the foundation of the film, "" Sorcerer ."" Although the first choice of star for the film was the Late Steve McQueen, the second choice of Roy Scheider as Jackie Scanlon was fated to be just as good. The rest of the cast Bruno Cremer as Victor Manzon, Francisco Rabal as Nilo and Amidou as Kassem all join in to create a feature film of superb quality. Each man is someone else when an oil company reaches into the heart of the Amazon seeking desperate men for an extremely hazardous job of trucking a cargo of sensitive and unstable Nitro over rugged mountains, treacherous bridges and monsoon jungles. The men hired are hiding and on the run, but each seek redemption through wealth if they live. The hand of fate had left them in obscurity but the film alludes to what length it will go to remind them of their destiny. An excellent job by director William Friedkin as he offers this movie to anyone seeking a dramatic classic. ****",325,0,,0,"No reference.

Set in an alternate present-day where humans, orcs, elves and fairies have been coexisting since the beginning of time, this follows two cops from very different backgrounds. Ward, a human and Jakoby, an orc , embark on a routine night patrol that will alter the future of their world as they know it.
The first thing you notice about this film is how great it looks. The make up and special affects really are stunning. The second is how old Will Smith is looking. 
The film itself is pretty good. I'm not a big lover of fantasy movies but because this is set in a modern day, gritty world it feels more relative.
I did prefer the first half where we follow the cops and they experience the prejudices amongst the public and their own colleagues more than the second half which is where the fantasy action goes into overdrive. Bright feels like a a cross between the 1988 film Alien Nation and the Underworld series of movies.

512,1974568,2010-06-06,jacob-l-williams,4.3.2.1. (2010),7.0,"4 3 2 1 is the latest film to come from the mind of Noel Clarke and right from the start it is obviously a film by him.The same snappy editing seen in Adulthood is once again present and the use of quick cuts to disorientate and confuse the audience is once again put to effective use in this intriguing and very well told story. The film is the type of film that I do not expect the mass public to like and pay to see, it is anti-main stream and proud. The narrative shows three days in the life of each of the four main girls as they each go about their business, it follows one girl at a time before rewinding and following a different girl, each time more being revealed about the characters and the situation.The film has little real plot as it is more of a character study of women (and crime) in Britain and has no real ending with a sort of cliff hanger that fails. A majority of the acting is also quite poor as the leads fail to give their characters the depth needed, the stand out performers are Ophelia Lovibond as the shy and troubled Shannon, and Noel Clarke in his role as the main villain.However despite all this it is still a film that I thoroughly enjoyed as Clark has once again written a script that captures drama and mixes it with comedy and has also used many techniques to give this film a very sleek finish and make it enjoyable to watch. I also enjoyed watching all the little cameos of famous people such as Ben Miller, Eve and Plan B. So in general if you take this film as a film then it is a failure in terms of narrative and performance, but very well made. However if like Clarke's previous films you view it as a social study on Britain it is very effective as within the four story lines Clarke tackles many subjects which young people in London encounter every day such as abortion, divorce, crime, drugs and even homosexuality (in a rather raunchy lesbian sex scene). The score helps Clarke put across his views on society as much like in Adulthood all of the songs are by contemporary R'n'B artists that perspective audience members will know and be able to connect to.After watching this I have to say that Clarke is become more defined in his film-making and script-writing abilities with each film he makes and the auteuristic qualities he brings to a film particularly in the editing; I just wish that one time he could hire some decent actors.7/10",444,0,,0,"No reference.

513,1695268,2008-09-07,johnnyboyz,1408 (2007),7.0,"The idea behind 1408 is actually kind of cute; a sort of 'what if' scenario based on what might happen if an inanimate object was given life. We've all seen Child's Play and perhaps the less than desired sequels but here, the inanimate object given life and then forced to fall into the horror genre is a motel room  a neat and effective idea. Following on from other such Stephen King adaptations, 1408 adopts the approach of putting someone in an individual location and then allowing events to unfold around them without ever letting them leave: it can be a prisoner in The Shawshank Redemption in a prison; a crippled author trapped in a lodge in Misery or a haunted motel room you cannot escape from as seen here.1408 begins with an immediacy; a false immediacy that caught me off guard and worked really well. We get John Cusack's character Mike Enslin driving in the rain, at night and clearly lost  an easy, easy set up for a horror film but what follows is him finding the motel he was looking for, staying the night and leaving the next day in some disappointment  it is an anticlimax, for the character as well as for us as we have been led down a route of suspecting the film will begin its scares from the very off with a familiar set up before having everything cancelled and having the film cut to some bright, colourful shots of people surfing.But the subject matter and choice of editing is the secret here and it mirrors the idea the director has for the anti-climax. A dark, wet and 'spooky' for the genre night is juxtaposed for shots of the sea and surfers going about their business in bright sunshine. In fact the film goes on and has its ghost hunting author of the lead role state that he hasn't ever actually even seen a ghost, which further adds to the now dead and unsuspecting atmosphere the film has decided to lay onto us. It's these early mind-games and cancelling out what we take for granted that kicks the film off wonderfully well, setting up things to come.But Mike is drawn to a hotel called The Dolphin, and its infamous room 1408 from which the film gets its title. 1408 is a doomed, cursed room that keeps its inhabitants and renders them insane over time by basically erasing them from the face of the Earth; either that or erasing the face of the Earth around them so that the room and the individual are the only things that seem to exist. But while the film is not flawless, the exchanges and that initial thirty to forty minute trip once inside the room has more than enough ammunition to label this a successful horror film. The pleasantries and the introductions are done in a very urgent and dismissive manner; hotel hot-shot Gerald Olin (Jackson) doesn't build the room up prior to entry in a 'be careful' or a 'it's dangerous' mannerism but goes the whole hog and simply tells Mike it's a death trap and he will not survive, period.The funny thing is that we have no reason to believe anything that initially happens in room 1408 is really all that bad. The film has given us a series of scenes prior to the main course of a night in 1408 that do not have anything to do with the horror genre, at least not conventionally: they consist of a beach scene where people surf; a public book signing and a scene in which the lead character checks their mail  how many horror films would usually have their lead check their mail before heading off for the film's main plot strand? But this is what's clever about 1408, the 'scares' at the early stage consist of window's accidentally shutting on the individual's hand; taps breaking off and spraying water everywhere and the alarm radio randomly coming on to the tune of The Carpenters.So these events could just be coincidence, indeed even Mike comes to the conclusion he has been drugged through the whiskey and complimentary mint after all the fancy build up and is imagining it all, he and us have good reason to believe it could all be fake. One of the other reasons 1408 works is because of its protagonist and how strong and independent they are  the hero here is not some teenager whose reason to exist is so that they can be chased by a knife wielding maniac, Mike is a smart man who seeks these sorts of situations down and indeed uses several methods to calm himself down when everything feels a little too real  he is rational and realistic.Although the best bit about 1408 is what you might come to realise afterwards in the sense it could be a metaphorical journey for Mike given what revelations and problems arise, to do with domestic issues, later on. 1408 is his purgatory where he is forced to confront his past demons; it's a metaphor for coming to terms with what happened and who he is, especially after so many monotonous mis-fires in this job as an author. 1408 is a creepy and unnerving film that also comes across as quite smart. In my view, a success.",889,0,,0,"No reference.  The review focuses entirely on describing the movie's plot, themes, and the reviewer's personal interpretation and enjoyment of it.

From the outset, the Set Design was a miss as I can't imagine a mystery writer living in a cold, stark concrete and steel mausoleum. Writers do research, they read books, lots of books, and not all are available via the internet, no matter what techies would have you think. Andrew Wyke would have a huge library available to himself within easy reach. The only books on that set were supposedly written by Wyke himself.The camera direction was not comfortable to watch as it was inferred we were watching things unfold through the security camera's. An interesting idea until some of camera's appeared to be tracking the subjects. Good trick, but only if the subjects are wearing tracking devises. They weren't. I have a hard time watching images that only show part of the subject as was the case at the start. It makes me pay attention to the camera and not the story. This is a trick of music video directors when they don't have much of a story to tell but still have to fill the time allotted. Branagh had a great story to tell, just not much of a script.Micheal Caine is a fine actor but when held up to Sir Laurence Olivier's Andrew Wyke, he is left lacking. Jude Law does a fine job with the character he was given but he still didn't outdo Caines original. The entire film was not long enough to give any good character development nor was there good use of the grounds as in the 72' version.If you have never seen the 1972 Sleuth, you may be excused for really enjoying this copy, but if you have seen the older one you will not be able to watch this without making comparisons.",318,0,,0,No reference.

517,2629305,2014-03-16,jadepietro,Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014),6.0,"This film is mildly recommended.Sometimes new and improved just isn't. Nostalgia can be a double-edged sword, or in this case, a double-edged Trojan sword. It cuts both ways. We have an insatiable urge for a newer model, one that has similar traits that were once deemed endearing and comforting. Yet we somehow yearn for a better more refined chassis. Simply put, what was formerly our beloved past blurs our more-than-real present. The latest facsimile simply cannot compete with our fondest memories of our past experiences. ￼Most sequels fail for that reason, even if there is much thought and care put into that revised reincarnation. Mr. Peabody and Sherman is the latest victim. Yes, technically the colors are more sharper, and there is more visual depth and detail. Even 3-D techniques have been applied to enhance this final product. Gone are the simple outlines, outdated animation, and flat washed-out colors of the 60's versions. Unfortunately also gone are the wit and fun of the original. Instead we have more plot about Mr. Peabody's parenting skills and a preachy message about the importance of family as the adventurous duo go Waybac and meet various historical characters and events. Some naysayers may even say a hidden liberal agenda with the new normal family unit runs deep in this film. (I wouldn't though.) What ran deep for me is a wistful feeling of my childhood, sitting in front of the television watching my Saturday morning cartoons. Allow me to digress here. Animated cartoons of my past like Quick Draw McGraw, Beany and Cecil, Magilla Gorilla, Underdog and Sweet Polly Purebread, and Huckleberry Hound come into mind. Not to mention other diversions on view back then: shows like Yogi Bear, Top Cat, The Flintstones, Mister Magoo, Winky Dink and Me, and The Jetsons. (Ah, the glorious past!)￼And of course, the quintessential Rocky and His Friends, from 1959, was the staple of my childhood upbringing. This particular program became my personal rite of passage into more adult humor, with the cleverest of word play, puns, and jokes that I was just beginning to understand. The cartoons on that show included classic characters like Rocky J. Squirrel,and Bullwinkle J. Moose, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, and segments like Dudley Do-Right, Fractured Fairy Tales (my favorite), Mr. Know-It-All, and Peabody's Improbable History, the story of a dog and his pet boy. It was Peabody's comical and abridged history lessons that inspired me to read up about the myths and legends as a child. Those cartoon shorts were quick-witted satire and the real hidden agenda of childhood education at its finest,before the advent of Sesame Street. It taught me everything I know and more.￼The 2014 version never reaches that level of excellence but is still entertaining and even highly amusing, sans the magic and charm. Many of the sight gags fall flat and the humor is of the hit-and-miss variety,but at least they tried. The artistry and craft is state-of-the-art, with fine voice-over support by Ty Burrell. Max Charles, Ariel Winter, Stephen Colbert, Leslie Mann, and especially Allison Janney and Patrick Warburton working overtime. Well directed by Rob Minoff, Mr. Peabody and Sherman may indoctrinate today's child into the world of yesterdays and long agos as it once did for me. Yet I'd rather have them (and myself) see the classic original outdated animation of a bygone era, with its simple outlines and flat washed- out colors, beautifully intact.

First the positives; Jackson obviously knows how to make a little go a long way and extract multiple mileage out of a simple idea, ergo, we open on a montage of Hoovervilles, soup-kitchens etc as Al Jolson bellows 'I'm Sitting On Top Of The World' which is not only irony but anticipates the finale with Kong atop the Empire State building and bellowing not quite so loud as super-ham Jolie. The opening is all about desperation, from the starving jobless in general to Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) and her actor friends specifically and then the desperation of those like Carl Denham (Jack Black) and his crew who DO have jobs but are about to lose them, which segues nicely into Denham's desperation to 1)flee the country one jump ahead of the moguls he has conned, 2) find a replacement leading lady at a minute's notice, 3) convince the captain (Thomas Kretschman to weigh anchor like NOW, Man and 4) con writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) into remaining on board til the ship is underway. Black's interior sweating recalls Oscar Muldoon (a great performance by Edmond O'Brien) in The Barefoot Contessa and there's a nice touch in the poster that Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler), a rugged Rock Hudson type sticks on his cabin wall heralding his appearance in Rough Trader and when Baxter is seen fleeing in terror on Skull Island insiders will recognise the reference to Richard Barthelmess an actor who made his name in aviation movies whilst being terrified to fly. Watts is fully believable as the naive trouper - a contradiction in terms if ever there was one - who instinctively runs towards Kong for protection from the T-Rex or whatever. The ludicrous note is that despite several close encounters with rough terrain and even rougher predators she manages to keep her clothes intact which defies logic especially in 2005 when no one is going to object to a little non-sexual nudity. On the negative side the natives disappear without trace once they have served their purpose of capturing Ann as a sacrificial offering and all of a sudden Jackson, who has been content to give us a blow-by-blow up to now, cuts from the chloroformed Kong to several months later when he's the main attraction on Mazda Lane. Clearly it would have been embarrassing to attempt to show Kong being transported in a ship his weight alone would probably sink to say nothing of there being no suitable restraints on board - perhaps foolishly Jackson allows Denham to draw attention to the size and strength of the restraints attached to Kong in the theatre, restraints which he had little trouble throwing off so how did they get him back?

The latter buys the smoker at auction and wants to keep it to peddle his fame while John wants it back because it is his connection to his dad.The challenge with the material is for educated audiences not to feel superior to the Crackers on the edge of insanity struggling with their demons, John alcoholism and Shannon fame.

Shannon sees he's the butt of jokes on the reality circuit and while disconsolate seems to be entering a sober phase of his life.Whether or not the filmmakers manipulate to make the subjects denser than they are is arguable, but they sure have some witty observations: About John, Shannon says, ""He was born with a silver crack pipe in his mouth.""

Red dresses belonging to the lady of the house, that perfectly fit two women whose height differential was at least a foot. Wait---driving into a TUNNEL in a land where any dark place is certain to be full of infected?  And keep on going in spite of obstacles highly likely to disable the car?  And replacing the wheel in dire peril, instead of driving out on the flat?  Come on! The hospital scene, where Jim wakes up (after a month in a coma, with full body strength!)

530,2229057,2012-01-05,hitchcockthelegend,Showdown at Abilene (1956),6.0,"Showdown at Abilene is directed by Charles Hass and written by Bernie Giler and Clarence Upson Young. It stars Jock Mahoney, Martha Hyler, Lyle Bettger and David Janssen. Music is by Joseph Gershenson and photography by Irving Glassberg.Plot has Mahoney as Jim Trask, a former Sheriff of Abilene who returns home from the Civil War with a guilty conscience and a new contempt for guns. Compounding his troubles is that his old friend Dave Mosely (Bettger) has taken up a romantic relationship with his girl, Peggy Bigelow (Hyer), and he soon learns that Dave is also into villainous activities. Can Trask overcome his troubles and restore order to Abilene and his life?Better than average and competently acted, Showdown at Abilene is a solid time filler for the undemanding Western fan. Although thoughtful in its treatment of the characters, formula dictates there are no surprises and comparisons are easily drawn to better Westerns with the same thematics. Mahoney (TV series The Range Rider) turns in a good show as the emotionally perturbed Trask, while as a stuntman by trade he isn't found lacking in the physical demands of the role as he leaps around with exciting conviction. Hyer (The Sons of Katie Elder) is pretty as a picture as serves the story well as a rose between two thorns, while Bettger (Gunfight at the O.K. Corral) scores favourably as the crafty Dave Mosely. Not faring so well is Ted de Corsa (also Gunfight at the O.K. Corral) as Dan Claudius, who looks (and is) wrong for prime villain duties. Shot primarily out of Morrison Ranch, Agoura in California, picture sadly is lifeless in colour, so we never get to see the locale and costuming come to life. Producer Howard Christie liked the story so much he re-made it eleven years later as 'Gunfight in Abilene', where Bobby Darin starred as the conflicted lead character.Nothing overtly impressive here, nor anything particularly damning either.

The plot is contrived and full of childish, simplistic clichés, too many to number. Disney is on its war path destroying anything remotely decent. Turning the magical ""The Snow Queen"" by G.H. Andersen into the abominable ""Frozen"" wasn't enough apparently. I'm cringing at a thought those butchers may get to one of Miyazaki's classics one day. (Spoilers) The plot had many questionable spots, but my biggest question was why for the love of God Hiro couldn't make the second neuro-band to try and take back control over his microbots? He went at length to turn himself and his clumsy friends into the super-heroes, but somehow decided that building an army of his own microbots was a waste of time? I don't even want to point out that 4 additional heroes were utterly useless and goofy, and why even mention the fact that Hiro appears in so obviously intellectually superior to any other character in this movie, yet he wanted to go to school and study. Robert Callaghan is chosen to be a villain because his daughter presumably died during failed experiment by Alistair Krei (what a silly name, Aleister Crowley was definitely an inspiration so we would think he's an ultimate evil), but of course she hadn't died. Baymax is as cute as Dupey and speaks like Dilbert. He's the only slightly meaningful character but thanks to such a predictable, contrived plot even he becomes annoying. His looks are a mix of Kung Fu Panda and Marvin from the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. I wonder if his brain is as big as Marvin's. In the end this cute inflatable fella sacrifices himself of course (wow!).I can't believe Disney wasted 165 million on the production of this ""movie"", but couldn't write a decent story and think through the characters.

Grayson and Keel quickly caught some of her spark as they got into costume (Grayson's long auburn wig looked so much better than her actual hair, and Keel looks much more manly in costume!). Grayson kept her trilling down a notch, and she was pretty darn fabulous in her ""I Hate Men"" number. The musical numbers are all pretty good, and after a slow start, ""Kate"" gets great.

543,3174835,2016-11-05,CANpatbuck3664,The Neon Demon (2016),3.0,"I decided to see this movie more because of the reactions to it than the subject matter. This seemed to be one of those movies that people either insisted was a cinematic masterpiece or the worst movie ever. I'll admit ahead of time that I haven't really liked most of Nicolas Winding Refn's movies. I didn't like Bronson despite the great job by Tom Hardy, I thought Drive was alright. I haven't seen Only God Forgives and after seeing this, I don't have any desire to. I can't say that there's nothing here and I have seen worse movies but unless you're a big Winding Refn fan or a cinematography junkie, I don't know if anyone in the general audience is going to get much out of this.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After the opening credits (which start with Nicolas Winding Refn's name) we join Jesse (Elle Fanning) when she's wrapping up a small scale photo shoot in an L.A. apartment. She's cleaning herself off when Ruby (Jena Malone) introduces herself. Ruby is a makeup artist working in the studio that night. She welcomes her into town and tries to make small talk with her. Jesse is nervous and isn't very forthcoming. Ruby tells her how beautiful she is and invites her to a party. They meet up with 2 of Ruby's friends Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee) who are also models. They're industry vets and their explicit conversations kind of throw Jesse off. Everyone is impressed by Jesse's beauty and wherever she walks, people turn and stare. After being signed by Roberta Hoffman (Christina Hendricks) she goes on a date with the photographer from her first photo shoot Dean (Karl Glusman). They seem pretty at ease around each other and Jesse tells him some of her story. She's actually 16 when she's been lying and saying she's 18 or 19. Her parents have unfortunately passed away and that one of the reasons she came was because she felt she had little talent other than being pretty. At the end of the date, Dean tries to make a move but Jesse brushes him off and heads up to her motel room to get ready for a shoot the next day.Nicolas Winding Refn's movies usually have one thing in common, they're visually impressive. I'll give The Neon Demon something, it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in a while. There's a bunch of scenes that are just visually insane. The movie gives you almost zero context on what they mean or why they chose to do that but they are pretty.As much as I didn't like the movie I don't want to blame the actors and actresses. I don't think anyone was especially good but the whole vibe of the movie is so sterilized and lifeless, it really seems like they were directed or told to act that way. Elle Fanning was fine, she seems well cast but there isn't much subtlety to her performance. She goes from a shy newcomer to a arrogant %^&*# almost instantly at the half way point. Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote and Abby Lee seem appropriate for this movie but they're also so robotic they don't seem like real people at all. Christina Hendricks is in the movie for so little time it's almost worth not mentioning. Keeanu Reeves is appropriately creepy but that's not so much do to his acting as it is his character being just so disgusting.Getting to the heart of the matter, I found this movie to be really boring and all the insane visuals in the world couldn't save it. The movie also seems to have an ego, it's done in a really stylistic way to seemingly distract from the complete lack of substance. People have defended this movie saying it doesn't have to seem like reality because its meant to be more like a dark fairy tale. If that's the plan, give me some remotely likable characters that I want to see succeed. I really didn't give a crap whether Jesse made it or not, sure the gruesomeness of what happens to her isn't earned but when it happened I did think to myself that she probably had something like that coming. Or how about a deeper story instead of flashing symbols in neon when there isn't the proper explanation to understand what the movie wants to get across? There's really almost nothing to this movie from a plot perspective. Its almost ironic because the movie turns out to be as shallow as its characters. When the movie finally switches gears and puts the pedal to the floor for the finale, it's not only stupid but kind of gross and needlessly violent. I'm not saying that the direction that they took was wrong because I knew it was a horror movie going in. The problem is that it turns super dark on a dime and the depth of the horror aspects doesn't seem to work with the rest of the movie.I was ready to give this movie a chance. The polarizing opinions on it actually gave me some hope, I didn't like some of Refn's work previously but even some of the critical community seemed to turn their nose up at this. Maybe that meant it might be my kind of thing this time. I did appreciate the quality of the visuals but while that normally helps the grade that your going to give the movie most of the time, when a movie is aggressively bad it almost makes you dislike it more. I had the same reaction when I saw The Spirit (which is one of my least favourite movies of all time). I think the strong art-house crowd will dig this and they're welcome to it.

547,1357557,2006-12-24,douglas2k4,Love.Com: The Movie (2006),7.0,"When dealing with manga-to-movie adaptations (or any adaptation for that matter), the director and his staff have to be very careful with the material that they have at their disposal. When all is said and done, and the film is released, the reaction to it can lead numerous paths. For instance, the film could be a disservice to the original fan base, displeasing hardcore fans alike. On the flip side, the film could also follow the route of being a faithful adaptation that could win over new fans as well as please the existing fans. ""Love Com"" is the rare case where the film is neither considered a ""fan service"" or ""fan disservice"", at least when I viewed it.

The film's storyline is the reiteration of the manga ""Lovely Comlex"". The main quirk of the manga is its two protagonists, Risa Koizumi and Atsushi Otani, who although with their considerable height differences, begin to fall for one another. In the film version, Risa is played by model Ema Fujisawa while Atsushi is played by singer and drama star Teppei Koike. The casting was a highlight for the film, with each of the lead roles, as well as the supporting cast, providing an accurate outwardly depiction of the manga cast. The use of vibrant colors throughout the film as well as the creative costume designs were also highlights of the film. Where the film falters though is the incredibly overreacting acting from the cast. Each character is so widely animated it gets to be a little irritating after awhile. I understand the use of facial expressions in order to express to the viewer what the character is going through, but the over abundant use just wears out over time. Combine this with a plot that is so thin, you can guess what happens next, and you got yourself a ticket to cinema clichéville.

Speaking of the cliché nature of the film, the film starts out promising enough, but then soon drivels into absurdity. For a film that harps so much on the height difference of its protagonists, it soon drops all that in favor for your standard trivial ""boy and girl don't like each other at first, but then slowly begin to fall for one another"" plot. In the end, the movie felt like one long Japanese television drama episode, which isn't a bad thing, but they could've done a lot more.

This is a quirky film, and you will probably have to be in the right mood to watch it. Not a film I would recommend to newcomers, (just stick to reading the manga first, then watch) but it's a film that should please some fans, but I imagine not all. Not entirely bad, ""Love Com"" does what it needs to do, and that is provide the laughs, which is one thing it does right.

548,1502152,2007-08-26,The_Void,"Anna, quel particolare piacere (1973)",7.0,"Secrets of a Call Girl is a rather odd Italian crime film as instead of focusing on the usual areas - shootings, car chases, fist fights etc, we focus on the hard done to girlfriend of a mobster; Anna, played by Edwige Fenech. The film is, therefore, is something like a cross between a crime drama and a romantic drama and in my opinion, it doesn't quite gel together - but that's not to say that this isn't a good film. The title implies that this will be a 'confessional' drama and implies that the central character is a prostitute, though that is somewhat misleading. As mentioned, the plot focuses on Anna; a young girl who works in a café. She goes from rags to riches when she catches the eye of Guido; an Italian mobster who takes her out of the café and into the gangster life. She soon realises that all that glitters is not gold when she witnesses a mob hit and the boss wants her silenced. Guido then decides to push her into prostitution, but when he is caught by the law; she decides to escape him and makes a new life with her son and a doctor.Edwige Fenech takes the lead role and does brilliantly with it. Her role here requires her to a little more than just take her clothes off, and she rises to the occasion well. It's easy to forget that she can act considering her roles in many of her films, so Secrets of a Call Girl serves as a nice reminder! The film also features performances from Corrado Pani, Richard Conte and John Richardson, who all do a good job in supporting roles. Giuliano Carnimeo takes the directors chair and does a good of directing Fenech for the second time, after The Case of the Bloody Iris. It has to be said that this film is more than a little slow at times, especially compared to other similar genre films owing to the fact that the focus is more on Fenech's character rather than the mob activities.

Characters who seem impossible to love, yet whose humanity and character evolve over time and earn their way into your heart and psyche, yes. Phenomenal acting from an ensemble cast, yes. The contrast between complete disregard for (a stranger's) life alongside complete familial devotion and regard, yes. Strange, compelling beauty even in utter violence, yes, that, too.Chloe Sevigny, once again, is phenomenal. The young actors, particularly the two youngest, are consummate professionals already, completely believable and lovable, yet complex. And the teenage characters are, as any reasonably honest depiction of teenagers, alternately infuriating and inspiring compassion. The only character I found too flat and one- dimensional was John, our initial antagonist, but his family *may* make up for it, if they continue with a second season in line with the first.Mia's is a family who has seen and experienced life very different from what most reviewers will ever experience: it's unfair to compare their lives to ours. And I expect that it's unfair to compare too closely the experience of Mia as a transgender person as other transgender people in our neighborhoods (unless, of course, your transgender friends are also freakishly beautiful and skilled hired guns).Nevermind the homophobes who believe that there can be nothing good about this series because of its focus on a transgender person (and please don't believe that transgender=gay because it doesn't). Obviously, this is not a show to watch with small children in the room, mostly for the violence and disregard for human life. Even at my age, I prefer to watch by the light of day rather than right before bedtime. And yes, the sex is pretty explicit but not quite hardcore (think ""R"" not ""X""). We see Mia in full-frontal nudity regularly, but it's all about the plot, not gratuitous. And almost all the characters are quite liberal with their language, with the F-bomb flying everywhere all the time, so in addition to not letting kids *see* this show, be careful about them listening from around the corner if you're concerned about that sort of thing.I think it all adds up beautifully, myself.

This is a movie that I can neither recommend but can't dissuade you from either.The story is pretty good. An astronaut named Spencer (Johnny Depp) and his partner trapped in space after an explosion and for a short time contact is lost. Depp's wife (the captivating Chareze Theron) waits for what seems like an eternity for information. Turns out he is alive but in a coma. He wakes up, gets out of the hospital and he and Jillian go home.But something isn't right about him. He just seems odd. Jillian sees him carrying on conversations with strangers and then brushing off her inquiries.In a movie like this it is almost impossible to get around the tired old plot device of having someone who works for an agency trying to get information out while his life is in danger. In this case he is played by Joe Morton as one of those sweaty, breathless guys who says things like 'I don't have much time'. I liked it better when Spencer's behavior was mystery that was slowly developing. I like to figure things out like this for myself, I don't like them explained.Jillian digs deeper and finds that the secret is buried in her own body. I liked Theron's performance as a woman who gradually begins to realize the gravity of her own situation. She is one of the rare actresses who can panic very well. I liked this character and hoped the movie wouldn't cop out on me. I did not however like Johnny Depp's performance. He comes off as one of those cold villains that speaks in a soft menacing voice and we are never given the opportunity to wonder if he is himself or if it's all in Jillian's head.The movie loses it's nerve in the last half hour. I found the ending to be confusing and trapped itself in tired old clichés with a special effects light and laser show that I have seen over and over and over.What I appreciated about 'The Astronaut's Wife' was the way that the is allowed tension build, at least for a while.

Yes, the songs are not new but you really don't notice that because of the stunning and unusual way the film is shot.

After such disappointments like ""Can of Worms,"" ""Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century,"" and the awful ""Smart House,"" to name a few, I didn't think Disney could make a decent TV movie. But here it is! This movie really is genius. Instead of going from cheap comedy and typical overblown plots, Disney made something that is nice and, most importantly, can make this stone-faced critic laugh a lot. Thirteen-year-old Charlie Boyle is a hockey-loving whiz kid so smart that he has been offered the chance to go to college early, to study, experiment, and even teach. naturally, he has a hard time fitting in with the college students, especially his hockey player roommate, who is in the physics class Charlie teaches. One day, he meets a girl and falls instantly in love, but, always being seen as a nerd and not having much success in the past with such matters, he pretends to be a trouble-maker and enrolls at the junior high the girl attends. Thus begins the fun as Charlie must constantly switch from one identity to the next so his lie is not discovered.
So how did Disney do it? How did they make something funny? Well, the cast is great, especially young Trevor Morgan as Charlie, who has some very clever and quick lines. A script that doesn't fall into embarrassing, unfunny, cliched situations for another, which is so typical for this type of Disney movie.

One of the inmates (Viggo Mortensen) helps break down a sealed execution room, which unleashes the spirit of a previously killed convict and soon strange murders are happening throughout the prison.PRISON is a film I skipped for over two decades because I thought the story just sounded downright stupid. There's certainly egg on my face because while the story is lacking and there are some major flaws here and there, for the most part this is a pretty well-made film that manages to have some very good performance and a terrific atmosphere. A lot of credit has to go to director Renny Harlin who made this just before A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 and three years before breaking into the mainstream with DIE HARD 2.What works so well with this movie is the atmosphere created by the director. The rundown prison makes for a wonderful setting and I thought the entire thing had a rather authentic feel. Just watching the film you could really feel yourself inside these prison walls thanks in large part to the atmosphere, which is perfectly captured by some very good cinematography. The cinematography also works extremely well during the murder scenes where all sorts of crazy stuff is usually happening. The death sequences here are original to say the least, although they're certainly a lot different than the type horror fans were wanting to see during this period.Speaking of which, it's easy to see why PRISON didn't get too much love when it was originally released. Released during the era of slashers, I'm not sure how many people wanted to see a haunted prison movie and especially one that didn't feature that many gory deaths. What death scenes are here are quite unique but I'm sure most people were wanting Jason and Freddy. Not some invisible killer. As much as I enjoyed the majority of the film, there are still some problems including the story that really doesn't add up to much. Another problem is that the 102-minute running time starts to drag a bit towards the end.Another good thing working for the film are its performances with Smith being extremely good in his role as the warden. I thought he did a very good job and delivered an intense performance, which is going to remind many of the one Tommy Lee Jones gave in NATURAL BORN KILLERS several years later. Mortensen also does a very good job leading the film and it's easy to see even here that he was destined to become a strong actor. Chelsea Field is good in the role of a social worker and supporting players Tom Everett, Ivan Kane and Lincoln Kilpatrick also turn in good work.PRISON is quite original when you think about it, although there are some flaws here that keep it from being much better.

571,2678585,2014-06-15,Tin_ear,World War Z (2013),6.0,"The zombie genre is dangerously overexposed at the moment. For the last ten years filmmakers have churned them out, in what is mostly motivated by the basest of financial considerations. Luckily World War Z takes the zombie concept in a slightly different direction than traditional films. In the same vein as 28 Days Later, only on a global scale, WWZ is arguably the culmination and most fitting depiction of the concept of the ""Zombie Apocalypse,"" and one hopes its final reiteration. While it is too deeply flawed to really recommend to anyone outside zombie and action fans, the zombie genre couldn't hope for a better send off.

The film is reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh's Contagion only much less dull. Though Contagion had the advantage of having an interesting antagonist, it also got bogged down telling one too many personal stories. In the end, Brad Pitt's central character, as unrealistic and epically significant he is in WWZ, is compelling enough to hold our attention. This movie doesn't really necessitate a bad guy, though a little more characterization might have helped. There are some good cameos I must say, but Pitt is what holds together this shambolic travelogue of a story. And considering the situation, his blunt exposition never seems forced. His character's simple mantra and guiding survival tactic (always keep moving) defines the attitude of the film. No one could accuse this reworked script of being too talky, that's for certain. As action sequences goes, it is quite striking.

But the film's problems are evident in its generic clichés and predictability. Brad Pitt's character is essentially a superhero, which in any other movie wouldn't be a problem however in a movie that stresses gritty realism and a foundation in hard science it just seems awkward. One scene in particular will test your suspension of disbelief, and maybe even ruin the film for you. As I mentioned before, the film was adapted from the book of the same title, and its ending reworked at the last moment. Whether the new ending played better than the original we may never know, but the tonal shift from bombastic to more subdued climax makes sense. The film would have been well served to provide us the opportunity to absorb and process what we seeing more often.

My only real complaint is that it never differentiates itself from the rest of the genre in any meaningful way, content to rely upon established zombie mythos and imagery found in any video game or B-horror. Though initially shocking in their animalistic disregard for their own bodies much like some swarming insect, the film none the less makes use of countless stock grayish, growling zombies, last-second escapes, and flickering fluorescent lights. In the decade since the masterpiece that was 28 Days Later, nothing in the zombie formula has really changed; good enough proof that the zombie phenomenon should probably cut its losses while it's still ahead.",487,0,,0,"No reference.

574,2815506,2015-02-14,Rickting,Final Destination 2 (2003),6.0,"Most film reviewers probably have an anomaly; a film or film series which they shouldn't like but do. The Final Destination films are mine. While the acting and writing are painful at times, the premise is intelligent and they're more effective than they're given credit for. Final Destination 2 sees a wimpy young woman(Alex Browning she ain't) foresee a hideous car pile up. She stops various people who were meant to die from getting onto the road, but death is not happy and soon starts claiming their lives in gruesome, gory Rube Goldberg machine style freak accidents. Gore hounds, you've met your match. This is weaker than it's highly underrated predecessor and is the 2nd worst in the franchise, although it's certainly not a bad film. The FD flicks were my first horror films and I used to be a big fan. I'm not as big a fan now, but they still hold up. FD 2 is not a scary film, but with a scare tool box of a log truck, a ladder, a window, a lift, a pipe, barbed wire, hospital equipment and a barbecue it is a surprisingly effective film. With it's dark atmosphere and suspenseful tone, you will be on the edge of your seat throughout.The thing which lets FD 2 down is the acting, which is awful. Ali Larter has improved a bit, Tony Todd is in full on creepy mode (In a good way) and 2 of the survivors, a stoner and a high school teacher, and reasonably well played. However, AJ Cook is a terrible lead, and most of the other acting performances are awful. Even though these people are seeing things which would traumatize a person for life, they look like they're watching Halloween cartoon for kids. The script is weak, with a lot of exposition and the characters in general aren't as likable as the survivors in the first film. The writing, acting and predictability of the plot weigh this down, but FD 2 is still a solid sequel. It's dark, creative and often genuinely tense. While it may lack a really good finale, there's still plenty of tension throughout. The car pile up is the best car crash scene in cinematic history as far as I'm concerned, and although this sequel makes no secret of the fact it's about the deaths rather than plot, it'll satisfy the gore thirsty fans and provide plenty of ghoulish thrills for many, myself included. They shouldn't have killed off Clear Rivers though.6/10",417,0,,0,"No reference.

575,1018628,2005-08-23,nycritic,Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star (2002 TV Movie),10.0,"Turner Classic Movies, the channel responsible of all films Classic, played this documentary on August 22, on their salute to Joan Crawford, and aptly sandwiched it between her worst movie at MGM, ABOVE SUSPICION, and her Oscar winning MILDRED PIERCE which has become to be regarded as a classic of soap-noir.The documentary, narrated by Anjelica Huston and with commentaries by numerous actors and directors who worked with Crawford as well as some darker tidbits by (who else) Christina Crawford, brings forth what is essentially the exact thing Joan played on-screen: a rags-to-riches life, a Cinderella story, the story of the ingénue who evolves from playing bit parts (and double to Norma Shearer at the very start of her career) to become one of the most powerful screen presences of last century regardless of the material offered to her. Suffice it be to say that her beginnings were humble. That she never met her father until much later in life. That eventually she became estranged from her brother Hal LeSueur. That despite every possible obstacle thrown upon her from feeling like an outsider amongst Hollywood royalty to pressure from MGM who pushed her out into the cold, she managed to stay in the game long after many top stars and ""rivals"" Greta Garbo and the aforementioned Shearer had passed on into early retirement by moving to Warners and assuring her resurgence as an actress and a well-deserved Oscar for MILDRED PIERCE. I find that the document in itself reveals quite a lot about Joan the person and from here on, Joan the Movie Star and Overall Big-Screen Persona. The comments from her co-stars and former directors are interestingly helpful in establishing how she faced acting in general while vary from pure praise (Cliff Robertson) to initial indifference turning into an apparent, reluctant admiration (Anita Louise), to open support (Diane Baker) when she was much older and alienated in a world/time which was much different than her early years in Hollywood. Everyone conceded that she brought something ""intangible"" to the table, an untouchable essence, even in her later years when it was clear that her career was long over and she was accepting parts in films like STRAIT-JACKET, I SAW WHAT YOU DID, BERSERK, and TROG. Co-workers from these films admit she played her parts as if she was still working on MILDRED PIERCE -- essentially saying she still had that which was considered ""It;"" the ability to transcend the mediocre (or at least, less than stellar) material. A shame Hollywood of the 60s stopped calling, but such were the times; while today many actresses keep busy, it's notable that these actresses start accepting smaller and smaller parts (one only has to see Anne Bancroft's career once the 90s came around: hardly a co-starring role in sight, all guest appearances, or the ""small but pivotal role"".). Joan, on the other hand, wouldn't have less than the title role, and sadly, parts aren't written with older women in mind.Now, I can't judge what transpired between her and Christina, but I noticed Christina seemed all too eager to bring forth the darker side of Joan -- how she forced the children to do the cleaning, the wire hanger incident, taking over her role in ""The Secret Storm"" and all I sense from Christina is an incessant need to repeat to the public how nasty Crawford was. The damage has been done already with the book and MOMMIE DEAREST, isn't it time to move on? Wouldn't it have been best to talk about all this while she was still alive? It's the only headache in the entire documentary.This one stumbling stone aside, JOAN CRAWFORD, THE ULTIMATE MOVIE STAR reveals a person who simply put, needed people, needed acceptance, and couldn't understand a life of quiet retirement. And while the sordid details of any actor/actress is public fodder, I find it better to focus on an objective source of information and put aside the sensationalism, and thankfully, this documentary is what MOMMIE DEAREST should have been and could not come at a better time, if it's twenty years too late, but late is better than never. It may not restore her name completely -- too much damage has been done and the scavenging of the monster MOMMIE DEAREST created has been lampooned to the death, most recently in Tyler Perry's DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN -- but at least it brings facts, not lurid details, to the forefront. And that's all that matters.",748,0,,0,"No reference.

(Lady Bird was superb in my opinion - next up is Barbie, written by Noah Baumbach and starring Margot Robbie - that should be interesting.)What interested me structurally about the movie is that it is essentially both an autobiography and a fiction - the novel itself is represented as little stories but the narrative describes how the book came about. For some critics this has been problematic as it requires (or allows if you prefer) a considerable amount of time-switching, that is not always captioned for the hard of intelligence.The movie is an emotional rollercoaster with peaks of hilarity and depths of real pity as the four March sisters, that make up the main protagonists, live a struggling middle class life surrounded in close proximity by deep poverty and significant wealth. It is this relationship with money, and the pursuit thereof, that is the central philosophical backbone of the movie and allows for many excellent vignettes and clear messaging that money is not the root of all happiness.On the side of the rich sit three excellent portrayals; Timothy Chalomet (outstanding as the main love interest Laurie), his wonderful and generous of spirit grandfather (played beautifully and touchingly by Chris Cooper) and the 'evil'(ish) rich Aunt March (Meryl Streep). Laura Dern continues her annus mirabilis as the girls' mother (it complements her performance in Marriage Story.)More than once the beautiful tableaux' that Gerwig sets up reminded me of Dorothea Langue's Migrant Mother. In that it resonates love and tenderness in the face of adversity.This is a tremendous piece of film making in every way. It's funny, moving, beautiful to look at, poignant and thought provoking.Saoirse Ronan is excellent, as always, but Florence Pugh's ability to appear both 14 and 26 is even more remarkable. Emma Watson is solid and poor little Beth is played touchingly by Eliza Scanlen.Overall it's a great ensemble production with the real star of the show, Great Gerwig.Bravo!",367,0,,0,"No reference.

It has an excellent pace, an excellent and rather unique fish out of water experience I was hoping was going to play out throughout the episode. Instead we get yet another ""Voyager does something good only to get punished for it later"" episode.

She solves the puzzle, the robot is fully functional and now they get to learn from the machine about who it is why it was in space.It all starts interestingly until we see the robots are not what they appear to be, they kidnap Torres because she can build and repair them.

Janeway is definitely a person who gives the benefit of the doubt.In the end, this is a shallow episode with shallow writing.

It poses nothing interesting of discussion, nothing interesting is learned other than for Voyager to never rescue more things in space. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.How could it have been fixed?First change the costume as they reminded me of the movie Sleeper and I really couldn't take them seriously. Moreso, rewrite this robot like Asimov would by making it a robot that evolved. That is, this robot gained consciousness, it feels alone, afraid, and it is praying to a God. We learn from this robot as it explores the ship and what a wonderful time for us to see the ship from this perspective. The ending could be a ship looking for it where the Robot refuses to return, kinda like Short Circuit.

This is KIND OF like crossing from hardcore to softcore porn, but Japanese AV as I understand it is real sex with the penetration ""optically fogged"" out so it perhaps doesn't quite have the stigma American XXX porn. And Japanese ""pink"" films are actually much better made films than American softcore (especially modern-day softcore). Sola has actually moved closer and closer to mainstream with recent films such as ""Man, Woman, and a Wall"". It certainly helps that she's got the most incredible body you're ever likely to see (and if it's not all-natural I want give her plastic surgeon a big hug in gratitude), but she is also a genuinely talented actress (especially, considering her AV origins). She could probably even get away with keeping her clothes on for an entire movie--but where's the fun in that? If you, uh, suffer from a Japanese schoolgirl uniform fetish, I would definitely recommend this since Sola plays easily the sexiest looking high school girl in the history of secondary education (it probably helps that she was about 20 at the time and had had A LOT of practice being sexy from her earlier AV career). The plot is not much to speak of--Sola's errant, sexually curious high school girl seduces a classmate and her male teacher (I understand the Japanese title literally translates to ""School Uniform Beauty: Shag Me, Teacher""). It's not nearly as good as her more widely available films like ""Man, Woman, and Wall"" and ""Raw Summer"", but it's good clean fun compared to some of her other, rather disturbing, early work like ""The STB Campaign"".If you DON'T currently have a Japanese schoolgirl uniform fetish, you certainly will after seeing Sola in (and out) of hers.

594,3190133,2016-12-03,rmax304823,Southpaw (2015),5.0,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Forrest Whitaker are up to par in this knock-kneed drama about pugilism. Whitaker always brings a little something extra to each role, rarely menacing, rarely perceptive, but always listening carefully. Gyllenhaal, as has become traditional, is bloodied in the boxing ring. He has three things going for him as the movie opens. He can take all kinds of punches without falling down. (Watch De Niro do the same in HIS boxing movie.) He's motivated by anger. And he loves his family, the cute Rachel McAdams who isn't around long enough, and his devoted daughter. He's so good, he's the champion. Of course his face is all misshapen and his wife wants him to quit the ring but he's pretty uneducated (he can't spell ""incarcerated"") and it's all he knows how to do. His speech is already slurred.At a party he meets the rising young star, Miguel Gomez, who is a very savvy and skilled fighter. Gomez flings a few ritual insults at Gyllenhaal's wife and daughter and the champ, being what he is, loses it. A fracas breaks out. Someone produces a pistol and McAdams is shot dead. As a result Gyllenhaal goes on a self-destructive binge and loses everything -- his house, his little daughter, his self respect, the esteem of the public, and the championship. He's now a bum living alone in a shabby hotel room.Of course we've been here before -- the sports hero battling his inner demons. And here, as elsewhere, and as my TV Guide puts it, he seeks redemption. I wish that word would disappear from our vocabulary because it's so overused. Listen, I had to learn about ""redemption"" in Catechism and redemption is when you do some terrible wrong and then make up for it by becoming sort of spiritual and by doing good works. ""Redemption"" does not mean ""success regained."" It's closer to what Freud called ""undoing."" The only person Gyllenhaal abuses is Gyllenhaal.That reminds me of my own career in the ring. In boot camp, they had try-outs for the boxing team. I knew nothing about boxing but my good friend Andy from Michigan accompanied me to the gym. He and I were outfitted with gloves the size of throw pillows and told to get in the ring and fool around. Well, Andy and I were buddies and didn't want to hit one another so we danced about and finally, bashfully, Andry swung his glove around in a long, slow loop large enough to trace the equator. I saw it coming and watched it curiously as it approached. It barely touched flesh and I was on my knees. End of ring career. Where was I? Yes. Well, now a desperate bum, Gyllenhaal finds an amateur trainer, Whittaker, and works his way up from cleaning the toilets to challenging Miguel Gomez for the championship. I will let you guess who wins. The scenes in the boxing ring are well done. When a guy misses, he misses fast, and only by half an inch, not by a mile. And the fighters actually seem to tag one another realistically. Whap -- a jab and the opponent's face is visibly knocked back.That's about the end of the good parts. Antoine Fuqua directed and he seems not to know when to leave well enough alone, or else he's aiming for an audience of semi-moronic Neanderthals who can't tell that Gyllenhaal is being crushed while he cradles his bloody and dying wife in his arms. The scene is full of blubbering and cries and lasts about as long as the Mousterian Age. It's not just the direction. There is no evident motive for his daughter's alienation. I suppose she blames her Dad for her mother's death but it seems hard to understand why she should, since Dad had practically nothing to do with the shooting. (Impressive performance here by Naomie Harris as the Child Care Worker charged with the daughter's welfare.) Whittaker teaches Gyllenhaal to fight as a Southpaw but nothing at all comes of it. The final bout is touted as ""a revenge match"" -- repeated over and over. But revenge for what? Miguel, Gyllenhaal's opponent, had nothing to do with the killing, and neither did Gyllenhaal himself.One wonder if it's at all possible to make a sports movie WITHOUT the hero falling from grace and finally ""finding redemption."" ""Rocky"" -- the first ""Rocky,"" not the egregious sequels -- was a good film about boxing and character and it ended realistically in a draw. This one is crowded with clichés and, what the hell, if the hero wants to find redemption let him join a monastery.",773,0,,0,"No reference.

It won the Oscar in the year of ""Citizen Kane"" (1941, Oscar Welles), and since then the aura of the ""unjustified"" Oscar sticks to the film.It may be true that ""How green was my valley"" was not the best film of 1941, that is not to say that the film is bad. Right in the opening there is a marvelous sequence. The film is told as one great flashback. As main character Huw Morgan (Roddy McDowall) starts to tell his story he is 60 years old en lives in a filthy brown Welsh coal mining town. As soon as he speaks the words ""In those days"" we return to his childhood and the landscape grows more friendly with the green colors from the filmtitle.""How green was my valley"" is an epos about the Morgan family in a Welsh coal mining village. It has characters with beautiful Welsh names in it, such as daughter Angharad (Maureen O'Hara) and daughter in law Bronwyn (Anna Lee). The Morgan family is a very traditional family with respect to male-female division of roles and the respect childrens ought to have for their parents. It is also an ideal family because the father (Donald Crisp) and the mother (Sara Allgood) are respectively a patriarch and a matriarch in the best sense of this word.Because of the character of the Morgan family, ""How green was my valley"" is a very conservative film too. Sometimes it is on the edge of melodrama, such as in the scene were the local choir has been selected to sing for the queen (a sideline which has nothing to do with the main stream of the story). John Ford is mostly known as a Western director, and the Western is an inherent conservative genre. Maybe this conservatism strikes more when it emerges in a non Western movie.By the way John Forrd may be known as a Western director, he earned his Oscars mainly with non Western movies, such as ""The informer"" (1935), The grapes of wrath"" (1940), ""How green was my valley"" (1941) and ""The quiet man"" (1952). From his Westerns only ""Stagecoach"" (1939) got nominated (but did not win).All in all, ""How green was my valley"" is a good craftfull piece of work. The cast is good but the best acting does not come from the stars (Maureen O'Hara as daughter Angharad and Walter Pidgeon as cleric Mr Gruffydd) but from Donald Crisp as father Morgan, Sara Allgood as mother Morgan and Roddy McDowall as the little Huw, from whoms point of view the story is told.",444,0,,0,"No reference.

605,1773404,2009-03-03,gary-444,The International (I) (2009),6.0,"A contemporary thriller featuring a corrupt bank, and the execution of banking officials, certainly scores on topicality. Overall, this attempt to deal with international terrorism, money laundering, fraud and geo-political power plays is quite enjoyable. One of the problems with financial misdeeds is that on screen, it is boring, and lacks dramatic impact. Director Tom Tykwer overcomes this by having people executed at regular intervals, and mixing it with the odd shoot out to pump up the action quotient.

Lead actor Clive Owen as international agent Louis Salinger is a serviceable enough action hero, Naomi Watts as his boss Eleanor Whitman though is totally miscast and lightweight. To his credit , Tykwer keeps the two hour running time ticking along, the drawback is that it is by a series of clichés and formulaic plot devices. You are never kept guessing as the plot unfolds.

Bank raids are exciting. Corporate plots to indebt third world country's are not. However a big budget allows the action to shuttle between Berlin, Luxembourg, Italy, New York and Istanbul, pretty much evenly divided enabling a scenic shift alone to create some new interest. But for every bit of cerebral intrigue, we are ""rewarded"" with routine action fare. Watts is run over, which hurts, but seems none the worse for her ordeal. A ""Jackal style"" execution scene is handled with the sophistication that Frederick Forsyth could muster on the back of a business card, and a shoot -out in the Guggenheim Gallery in New York is so over-blown it could have been Rambo taking on all-comers in a firestorm of automatic weapon fire.

The climax is pure James Bond.

And this one delivers on both counts.From the first moment she appears on screen Dana Wynters is captivating and gives a sensitive performance as a young and very beautiful German girl trying hard to survive a horrible time in the closing weeks of WWII after losing her family members and home to the allied bombing. Through perseverance and happenstance she manages to emerge intact and reconnect with an American soldier that she and her father had helped out once as an escaped POW.The cinematography is wonderful and authentic and shows scenes of utter devastation amidst the beauty of the German architecture, for example, the scene near the Cathedral of Cologne.My favorite scene is one where the characters were taking a boat trip down the Rhine River. The scenery is dazzling as they make way past the castles and vineyards, and especially as they pass the famous Loreleis with the sirens (actually German children) singing.Given the harsh reality of this time in history and the context, the movie avoided being particularly brutal and merely hinted at the horrors of what so many Germans went through at the end of the war. I appreciate the way this movie humanized the people of both sides.Mel Ferrer gives a solid performance as the friendly, informal American G.I. Joe. Many of the actors are European which really makes the movie better and more authentic. I would highly recommend this one to anybody and would watch it again any time just to see Dana Wynter's captivating beauty again.

Whilst this does eventually occur toward the end of the first season and dissappointed me since thats not what I went into it for (hence atleast 2 points deduction) I genuinely found the story and its characters fascinating. Dealing with the raw emotions of the families and people behind a mission like this in a world we all know could be in the future was a different level of story I honestly wasnt prepared for. I would heartily recommend this to any enthusiast of space and its exploration or stories involving it.
Its not stricly sci-fi (at least to my understanding of the genre) as much of the story is based on things that are currently happening even if a decade into the future.
However there were genuinely touching, even heart wrenching moments that, if you're into exploring the human side and struggles of those involved in making the sacrifice that inherently comes with exploring the unknown? Then this could very well be a fit for you.
My only complaint really with the series is the somewhat misdirect of the marketing and (for that other point of deduction) the sometimes slow paced nature of the story.

Oh, how the blood and limbs fly! I'm not a sadistic violence-loving fan of Hostel or anything, but while watching 300 I was constantly bloodthirsty for more. More of that awesome regular-mo/slow-mo Persian ass-kicking that Gerard Butler proved to be great at. Every battle scene was a superb montage of blood and guts, interlaced with Persians falling off cliffs and Butler and company shouting chilling battle chants.300's cinematography was dazzling, although much of this was more post-production work than camera work. Nonetheless, Sparta, wilderness, and the ""Hot Gates"" are all mesmerizing to look at: think a talented artist's depiction combined with realistic CGI to create surreal dreamscapes of an epic scale.Undoubtedly, this film's selling point is its monumental action sequences, but I have to credit the acting of both Gerard Butler and Lena Headey, here, too. Butler, who I haven't really noticed before, is now at the forefront of my favorite actors. He's intense, serious, and unflinchingly awesome as King Leonidas. If I was ever to go into battle, I'd be happy to have him there. His character's wife, played by Lena Headey, was also terrific. Women tend to take the backseat in movies like this, but she played her character with strength and conviction, allowing her to shine in several of her scenes.I was drooling for most of this movie. It was just so utterly amazing in a number of ways, especially, again, in its battle scenes. I'm confident that this movie will be received well for years to come, that it will age like fine wine.

The FX were pretty good with the exception of some undetailed miniatures at the beginning of the film. It was also a bad having the mutant cephalopod roar.

First let me start with the premise. Two out of their luck hitmen(?) named Longbaugh and Parker, search for that one chance at fortune. In the beginning of the film, we learn that they earn their money by means of donating uh, well, their ""fluids"" and blood. While in a sperm bank, the pair find out that a surrogate mother, Robin, of a rich couple is conducting her usual check up with her doctor. With that Longbaugh and Parker kidnap Robin and place a ransom on her.Anyways, the movie contains some of the most exciting gun-fight sequences. Sadly, that's the only positive thing I have to say about the movie. The scenes in between the flying bullets were long and boring. I felt that some of the conversations between the characters were superfluous and would be better if some of it were edited out. With a title like ""The Way of The Gun"", one would expect the movie to be high on the action meter and less on the banter. A lot of the characters were two dimensional. The average performances from the actors (except for Lewis doing her usual psycho role) made it a lot worse. I can only recommend this movie when it comes out on video.

Indeed, some of the coincidences that arise as the film goes on are the weakest link in this otherwise near-flawless movie.There has been much talk about the violent scenes in this movie, which are many, but especially the scenes with animals.  My view is that it is no more morally wrong to depict violence to animals than it is to depict violence to humans, as long as no animal (or human) is actually harmed in making the depiction.  We are told that none of the animals were harmed in the making of the film (and presumably also none of the people).  As far as I am concerned that is the end of that matter - the use of animals, unhamred, for this purpose is acceptable.  To argue otherwise I find, frankly, daft. However, I would recommend that people who get particularly upset when violence to animals is depicted should simply avoid this movie.Back to the movie - the acting and the cinematography are superb.

Not that there is any secret to be revealed here - pretty much everything you need to know about the soulless, spirit-crushing side of movie-making is contained in Raymond Chnadler's 1945 essay ""Writer's in Hollywood"", which contains more horror than any of the celluloid parodies it has since inspired.Swimming with Sharks is the tale of innocent Guy (a freshly scrubbed Frank Whaley), whose monster boss is tinsel town king-maker Buddy Ackerman, a screaming, mood-shifting bully who dangles just enough opportunity before Guy to keep him on his leash. But payback is due, and comes in spades.It is all very dark and delicious, and Spacey gets to rip loose as the psycho boss, the joke being that it is his very lack of sanity and compassion that allows him to thrive in the business. Love interest is supplied by producer Dawn (Michelle Forbes), who allows Guy to stay grounded as he negotiates his way to the top. Dawn and Guy show us that even in Hollywood true love can conquer all - or can it? It is received wisdom that movies about movies don't travel very well. Swimming with Sharks is about delusion and corruption, and how much the human spirit can take. It just happens to be set in Hollywood, but Buddy Ackerman could be Gordon Gecko in a different market. Worth watching to see Spacey enjoying himself in a role where he gets to say pretty much whatever he likes, and does so with relish.",274,0,,0,"No reference.

They might have had 100 thousand but probably less and they made a movie. A Fantasy movie and we should all be supporting Scott and Dragon no matter if we think it is bad or good. Because after several more experiences he could be making more Fantasy. And thats all we want. Yes they could have worked harder on the sword play but it looks like they were clashing with real steel metal... and on bigger budget films they clash with fiber-glass and aluminum swords so they can really hack away and hit each other. I saw the making of and thought these guys are crazy to hit steel on steel... a sword could break and impale someone or they could chop off a finger no matter if the sword was not sharpened. The Dragon was done on someone's home PC or Mac so that is pretty cool. A few more layers of texture and it would have been really good... it was better then the giant blue rooster in Eragon. The acting was good. I thought the actor with the most charisma was the big warrior... his accent was iffy at best... I think he should have just used his American accent because this is Fantasy... not Enlish history. The two warrior knights were solid British actors, I bet really good a Shakespeare. All the girls were solid especially the Magic user with the white contacts. She has a Angelina Jolie quality that really made this film watchable... please bring her back in the sequels and a reincarnated Gandalf character... who is more powerful.

A few simple things could have really improved this movie... change of locations... find some rocks or a cave... lots in Wisconsin. Cut dialogue in half... find a dwarf... do not clash real steele swords (only in close ups)... you are going to kill somebody and it never looks right. All in all we should encourage Mr. Scott to formulate the story and bring it back for two more... come on a low budget fantasy trilogy... that's good and ambitious... spend a few thousand dollars on a really good script doctor or a professional who is really savy with dialogue (Mr. Scott and his writing partner are good with original story... while Eragon is a plot point for plot point copy of Star Wars).

628,3038465,2016-03-06,timdalton007,The Thin Red Line (1998),9.0,"When one reads or hears the term ""war movie,"" it brings with a certain amount of baggage. One perhaps thinks of the British war films of the 1940s and 1950s with stiff upper lips or Hollywood epics such as The Longest Day or Patton or Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Then you get a film that has the apparent look of the genre but is something quite different when viewed closer. The Thin Red Line, Terrence Mallick's 1998 film based on James Jones' 1962 novel set during the US Guadalcanal Campaign against the Japanese during World War II, is just such a film.For one thing, this film is without many of the pretentious things war film clichés and tropes. There's no big speeches about patriotism or glory or the righteousness of the cause being fought for. Not a single one of the characters presented here likely cares or thinks about that. These are ordinary men in extraordinary situations, some in the Army before the war started, others caught up in events that see there fates bringing them to this small Pacific island. As a result, their reactions to the battle are many and varied. They range from bravery to boisterous, brutality to thoughtfulness and a whole sweep of emotions in-between. The choice of voiceovers is intriguing, giving word to the emotions and thought processes taking place in the minds and behind the eyes of many of the soldiers the viewer meets. Indeed much of the film is based on those emotions rather than huge, sweeping battle sequences which is something that is likely to upset some viewers. Yet it may be for the film's betterment.For it's brought to life by a series of strong performances. The film's cast is massive including both name actors in small roles and then unknowns who've gone on to greater fame is some cases all playing soldiers of varying ranks caught up in the incredible campaign. It's hard to argue that the film has any central character though both Jim Caviezel as the thoughtful Private Witt and Sean Penn's pragmatic bordering on cynical Sergeant Welsh come closest to that with their very different reactions to the events taking place around them. The film's massive cast includes Elias Koteas, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson with cameos by Miranda Otto, John Travolta and George Clooney as well. The combination of on screen performances and voice overs present one of the most unique mixes of talent one is ever likely to watch.As well as its strong performances and interesting emphasis on the human cost of war, the film is also a visual feast. Mallick and cinematographer John Toll set The Thin Red Line apart from many ""war films"" with lush cinematography that contrasts the beauty of the Pacific and Guadalcanal with the horror and violence of the battle being fought there. Sequences such as the film's opening and closing minutes are superb examples of this from both before and after the battle. Plus, for all of its focus on the human cost, the film's battle sequences are each superb examples of well staged and photographed chaos that celebrates not the triumph of victory but the desperation of men trying to stay alive. Backed by a haunting Hans Zimmer score that also incorporates music by John Powell, the result is powerful.At the end of the day, The Thin Red Line is an unlikely mixing of an art house flick and a big budget Hollywood war film. It is a feast for the senses with its combination of striking visuals, superbly staged chaotic battle sequences and a haunting music score. Yet it's more than a typical war film as it examines the effects of war on the men who fight it and the contrast between the beauty of the island with the horror and chaos afflicted upon it. The film remains a unique look at war from one of cinema's most unique directors.",658,0,,0,"No reference.

This is one such film....SHEEPDOG!From his early childhood Texan Chris Kyle has been reared to obey orders and not question. An early scene in the film sets the tone. Over dinner his father gives Chris the choice of being a wolf, sheep or sheepdog. Holding a belt in his hand (to thrash them with) his father then continues to eliminate wolves and sheep from possible career paths for Kyle and his brother.Eventually Chris joins the US SEALS as a sniper to nurture his sheepdog skills further. From here stationed the film follows him home and away as he does four tours in Iraq. The film descends into the Jingoistic one dimensional film that you thought Hollywood had stopped making. The bad guys are all on the other side. Its true Chris Kyle killed women and children but it was justified since they were ""Savages"" who did not have the right to protect their soil. The few Iraqis that did co-operate were either duplicitous or greedy for money (by the way the got what they deserved, everybody else did according to Chris Kyle's autobiography on which the film is closely based)I've been watching Bradley Cooper over 10 years now since his regular appearance in the acclaimed TV series 'Alias'. Every Big screen performance has increased his stature as an actor able to take on a variety of roles. Cooper's Portrayal of Chris Kyle here is no exception. He perfectly plays the character with the required weight (physically and emotionally). He tries to show this racist ""hero"" as a man with pent up frustration and Angst. But the character is too one dimensional. You are left with no sympathy for him. How can you when a man says he had no regrets about killing over 150 people. No all 166 bullets were perfectly justified he was happy to meet his maker when he questioned him (his words not mine).This sheepdog was just protecting his herd.At various times the film tried to turn this into a duel with an enemy sniper but this had been done already with great success by the film Enemy at the Gate with Jude Law.In reality the film was more like the Nazi sniper cinema promo in Tarantino's Inglorious B*stards.That was another film which glorified a sniper, however that was done to show the inhumanity of the audience. A testament to those who rate this film so highly now perhaps?The directing was flawless and the action sequences were taught and expertly done.Call me idealistic but when I watch a film I like to see a biopic that inspires or educates me. This simple Good v Evil line should be kept to animation or superhero genre. I like a so called true story to leave me feeling that I was somehow a better member of the human race. I thought we had seen the end of jingoistic and bigoted views of the Iraq conflict albeit glossily done after all it is over 13 years since 9/11 and even the US government admitted it tortured, detained and killed people inhumanely in an unjustified war. In this film only the other side did atrocities like that..so says the sheepdog.Mr Eastwood you are a veteran cinema actor/director. You can pick and choose any project. I expect better from you.

GONKS tells the story of an Alien who comes to earth to settle a dispute between the two great nations of our future planet. One nation loves rock and roll, the other, ballads.

It works, but not before a bunch of mediocre rock songs and wretched ballads are sung, cheap interior sets are trampled and the audience's patience is worn thin. Meanwhile, on planet Gonk, a bunch of hand puppets runs amok.

635,3021210,2016-02-03,lucasnochez,Steve Jobs (2015),10.0,"It is often stated that the line between insanity and genius is measured only by success. When discussion turns to that of one's genius, we find it difficult not to equate that genius with some level of insanity. This is especially true when that discussion focuses on Steve Jobs, the man behind machines that allows us to hold the world in the palm of our hand. Steve Jobs is not simply a film, but is an experience of perception; of history; and of a household name.When evaluating Steve Jobs the film, one has to stop and admire the genius of writer Aaron Sorkin. The Academy Award winner extends the parameters of his brilliance through a film that not only allows us an understanding of a complex mind, but accurately illustrates the torments, criticisms and neglect that shaped the man entrusted with its ownership. Based on Walter Isaacson's non- fiction memoir, Sorkin's script rockets off the tongues of the film's talented cast and grabs your attention as you dance through every nuanced conflict of Jobs' life. Daringly mimicking theatre in its three-piece act structure, the film presents the events of three major launches, and three very different pictures of Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender), in real time.The first, shot in low-resolution 16mm film, set in Cupertino, California, shows a grainy and young Jobs moments before his inaugural Macintosh in 1984, days after the infamous science fiction based Apple commercial. The second, showing the recently axed Jobs, in 1988 at the historical San Francisco Opera House before his infamously disastrous NeXT cube launch in widescreen 35mm film displays a vengeful and highly orchestrated Jobs. Finally, in 1998, returning to Apple, this time as CEO, utilising high-definition digital film at San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall, before his presentation of the iMac. The last act presents to the audience the most human yet morally flawed version of a man no one ever really understood. Each scene, running close to thirty five minutes each, is as enthralling, entertaining and orchestrated as the next.Jobs has always maintained a very muddled and misguided personal life; one that includes a young daughter Lisa with a college sweetheart Christen Brennan (Katherine Waterston), very uninspiring social skills as well as a knack for being referred to as unlovable. Sorkin's script looks to answer one of the biggest questions plaguing the late great tech genius: can a great man still be a good man? Thanks to an electric script by the great Aaron Sorkin, phenomenal performances on all fronts, masterful direction and a brilliant neo-classical score by Daniel Pemberton, Steve Jobs is easily a crowning cinematic achievement and the best film of 2015, in spite of not being the most audience alluring film released this award season.From the beginning, the film is a pish-posh of gossip and rumours. Not that anyone thought the film would bow down to the atrocious Ashton Kutcher vehicle Jobs in 2013, but the film did suffer a slew of ""technical difficulties"" going into production. Once in the hands of David Fincher, the film was always setup to be as great, if not greater than The Social Network. With Christian Bale initially cast, the film went through directors, stars and crew like a Daytona racetrack, eventually settling on director Danny Boyle, and stars Michael Fassbender and Daniel Pemberton instead of a roster that may very well have included Fincher, Bale, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Luckily for audiences, Steve Jobs is not an unwanted and pumped out studio biopic, and focuses less on the look of Jobs and more on the essence of a man struggling with himself more than the struggles of an economically competitive technological world.While the film is presented in a very basic three act structure, there is nothing simple about the film. Driven by dialogue, its characters and three very crucial times in the life of Steve Jobs, the abstract delivery of these highly regarded singular events of the 20th century are presented with ease and class.In a world where recognition is everything, and being pointed out in humiliation and failure could forever change your reputation professionally, Steve Jobs, logically speaking, had no right becoming a pioneer of technology. He was no engineer, designer or programmer, yet, the world knew his name and the ramifications of his brilliance. In one of the many powerful scenes of the film, when confronted by his cohort and early friend, Apple Co-Founder Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Seth Rogen) what he does. In response, Jobs says, ""I play the orchestra!"" Often times being measured next to Leonardo Da Vinci, Julius Ceasar and God himself, Jobs was often misconceived as a diabolical man with a plan, giving out the passes to whomever came in his way.While many may be very discouraged to see the film, with fear that a biopic of a gifted tech guru would be overwhelmed with difficult tech-inspired lingo, the film is a well balanced feature showcasing moments of extreme drama, emotion and heart. Many of these scenes are anchored with Jobs by himself, the women in his life, father figure and late CEO of Apple John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) and friends. The emotions in the film hold together the very fine strains of intensity and drive the white-knuckled pace of the film overall.Holding the very intimate moments of the film are the women in Steve Jobs; an old flame Chrisann, his daughter Lisa (played by Makenzie Moss at 5, Ripley Sobo at 9, and Perla Haney-Jardine at age 19) and the only person who ever stands up to Jobs, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet). Sorkin, who has more than enough substance with his male leads, uses the women in Jobs' life to draw out the kinks in the suit of amour Jobs so easily shows us, dealing with simple issues of patriarchy, ego, and image.",967,0,,0,"No reference.

636,1243916,2006-07-15,charchuk,Superman (1978),8.0,"The classic superhero movie, perhaps a bit dated but still fantastic. The origin story is done superbly, building up his beginnings without rushing through it too fast. Though the scenes at Krypton go on for a bit too long, and some don't have any effect on the rest of the film (mainly the trial scene - though it relates to the sequel), the film never feels boring and the pacing is perfect. The one that all other comic book films borrow from nowadays, with the perfect blend of action, romance, and comedy. Truly a classic.Though he is only third billed, Reeve is clearly the star of the show and delivers an iconic performance. Not only is his portrayal of Superman fantastic, but his dual role as the nerdy Clark Kent is even more difficult to pull off and, yet, spot-on. With Reeve's performance, there's no wonder how the characters don't put two and two together - the two roles are very much separate. Hackman is a great Lex Luthor, with perfect comic timing and good rapport with his sidekicks. Brando pretty much sleepwalks through this one, but he still makes it work. Kidder still irritates me as Lois Lane, she's the one major problem I have with the film. Very shrill and annoying.The only flaw I see in the story is the ending - not only is Luthor's plan completely implausible (like the military wouldn't check the codes again before firing the missiles), but Superman's solution to Lois' death is a complete cop-out. If Superman can turn back time, what's to stop him from solving any problem at any time? It removes an element of realism from the film and loses the suspense. Though it was nice to see Superman get really angry, to show that he's not emotionless. Everything else leading up to climax, however, was perfect.The effects are a little dated but still work, you can still believe Superman's flying. John Williams delivers another memorable score, and it works very well with the film. There are some scenes that are far too cheesy (saving the cat out of the tree, delivering Lex to the prison at the end), but they don't feel terribly out of place. And Reeve takes the role very serious, enough to compensate. Overall, one of the best comic book films of all-time and one of the better films of the '70s. Outstanding.",398,0,,0,"No reference.

You start to act different, think different, and realize that you are growing up and there is nothing you can do about it. For Jim Stark this is more than he can handle.Nicholas Ray's classic Rebel Without a Cause is a look into the life of Jim Stark (James Dean) and his attempt to try and figure out what he wants to do with his life. Should he try to become an adult or should he enjoy what little time he has left and cut loose?The movie opens with Jim after he has had a few too many drinks. After being taken to the police station his parents are brought in to help find out what he did and why he did it. His parents (Jim Backus and Ann Doran) are torn over what to do with him. The father is understanding but the mother wants him to learn his lesson and make sure it does not happen again. Their fighting is ""tearing him apart!"".Also at the station is Judy (Natalie Wood) and John ""Plato"" Crawford (Sal Mineo). Jim offers his coat to Plato but he refuses. It was just a kind gesture, but given Plato's emotional state, it is a justified response.The next day is Jim's first day at his new school. He leaves the house in a good mood, telling his parents how this might be it for him. After meeting Judy, who appears to be unfazed by the incident she had in the police station, Jim is off to school where he learns of a field trip for that afternoon to the planetarium.It is hear where he encounters Buzz, the leader of the ""cool"" crowd. After slashing Jim's tires, it's ""examination time"", or a little knife fight. No jabbing, just sticking. Jim almost loses it but keeps his cool. Buzz challenges Jim to a ""chicee race"" at the bluffs. Jim accepts having no idea what that is.The events that follow are like a wild goose chase for Jim and his new friends. They go everywhere from the bluffs, to an abandoned mansion, and the planetarium. It's a wonderfully written script using great dialogue between Jim and his parents. The camera work is also a magnificent display, using great angles and unique shots. Ray had the perfect vision of what he wanted his film to look like.Color is often used to showcase significance or symbolize a certain aspect of the film. Jim's red jacket, Judy's red coat in the beginning, and Buzz and all his cronies where black leather coats.Dean's performance is remarkable. It is a shame he was only featured in 3 films, none the less, he is one of America's icons. He symbolizes what every guy wants to be. He is not the only good performer. Backus gives a tremendous performance as the father, the understanding, somewhat lenient parent of Jim Stark. Wood and Mineo both received Oscar nominations and both were well deserved.As mentioned earlier, these are the most confusing years for a teenager. One scene that says it perfectly is after the knife incident when Jim comes home. He walks up the stairs to find what appears to be his mother in an apron cleaning up. It turns out to be his father cleaning up the food he spilled for his wife who is a little under the weather. They both laugh and Jim tells him to leave the food so she can see it. The father doesn't understand and Jim just keeps telling him to. He gets flustered and walks away. He stutters and just can't give a straight answer to his father. This is a perfect comparison to much of Jim's life. He does something but cannot explain it.Rebel Without a Cause is a classic from the 1950's.

For a start this is a contemporary crime thriller, not a fantasy, and in addition the credits are completely different on the print I saw. The direction is credited to Godfrey Ho and the producer is listed as Tomas Tang; the cast lists mainly Mandarin names. This may have been a South Korean movie or alternatively one shot in Hong Kong or Taiwan; I really have no idea. It's a pretty average film anyway, about a pair of card sharps who get involved with the mob and have to fight for survival. The main fun comes from the novelty of seeing Hwang Jang Lee in one of his rare good guy performances.

Lee turns out to be just as efficient a fighter playing the hero as he was playing the baddie, although seeing him getting beaten up so easily early on is a bit difficult to swallow. The rest of the plot is quite ordinary, with sneering master villains and the like, with physical deformity or quirk usually added to enhance the villains (in this instance one of them has a blind eye). The acting is undistinguished, but the suits certainly look expensive, and the action is fresh and fast enough to make this work.",235,0,,0,"No reference.

I was on a role to, took her to Immortals she loved it, Avengers she also loved it. Third time Prometheus. Oops..If you take someone to Prometheus on a first date you will not be getting any sex, you will not even get a second date. This movie is so bad it made me Sign up for IMDb account just to give it a poor review. They should have just made it a separate movie but they added the last scene in so it could get the entire buzz about being a prequel and thus gain viewers like me who loved the ""Aliens 1 and 2"" growing up.Let's start with Aliens. A great movie. I wrote a paper in ""Women in Film"" class comparing Ripley to Jesus and how Ridley Scott is a genius. I've seen every alien movie over 10 times each. The first one is amazing the second one is also amazing the third is great and the four is good. So I understand Ridley Scott is running out of ideas and it is hard to write four extra movies from 1. So I assumed this would be like a crappy alien 5. Was I let down. It was awful. I agree with everyone on that its visually stunning. So it taking drugs and watching glow sticks but its Not really what makes a movie. PLOT makes a movie. When you want to create suspense you first build the characters then have terrible things happen to them. With Sci Fi you can do things that are unbelievable, but the way the characters act still needs to be real. I had no attachment to anyone on the ship. They all could die I wouldn't of cared. I feel like Ridley Scott is like a rock star of directors, but even rock stars make shitty Christmas albums. He's old and out of touch with what movie need. They could have gotten rid of all the special effects and told a better story I would have been happy. I feel like no matter what this movie was going to make him money so he didn't care. I bet it's that asshole from lost a show I never watched and am glad. He shouldn't have surrounded himself with such poor writers he was doomed from the start. Ahh WTF So you are telling me Aliens were created by a robot who poisons a man who has sex with a infantile woman who then gets an alien aborted squid removed from her abdomen which grows into a larger face sucker which deep throats a humanoid alien and poof the first alien is born? ah!! Everyone knows you start humanoid alien spaceships with a flute solo?? The only thing they did right was the marketing, I REALLY wanted to see it, AND I see about 4 movies a year. One more thing was right the name Prometheus stole fire; this took the fire from Ridley's Career.

642,2660149,2014-05-11,howard.schumann,Heaven Is for Real (2014),8.0,"Most parents as well as many psychologists, educators, and religious leaders assume that children are not able to be ""spiritual,"" and their experiences are dismissed as fantasy, hallucination, or pathology. Randall Wallace's Heaven is for Real, however, asks us to keep an open mind and listen to our children. Based on the bestselling book by Todd Burpo and Lynn Vincent and adapted for the screen by Wallace and Chris Parker, the film dramatizes the near-death experience of then four-year-old Colton (Conner Corum) during surgery for a ruptured appendix as told to his father Todd (Greg Kinnear), a local pastor and volunteer fireman in rural Nebraska.

According to young Colton, during his surgery he could look down and see his body on the operating table, see his father venting his anger at God in an adjacent room and his mother Sonja (Kelly Reilly) talking on the phone. He talks about a vision he had of a place of light and beauty that he called ""heaven,"" reflecting his Christian upbringing. Colton also describes a vision of Jesus riding on a multi-colored horse, sitting on Jesus' lap, and listening to angels singing to him. More surprisingly, Colton says that he met his grandfather whom he identified from an old picture and a second sister who died in a miscarriage many years ago even though he had never been told about her.

Todd, who had a rough year, fracturing his leg playing baseball, enduring a bout of kidney stones, and struggling to make ends meet financially, is uncertain how to deal with his son's story and the family's reaction captures the fear and confusion that many adults have when children know or see more than we think they should. While first dismissing it as a child's vivid imagination, the details that emerge of Colton's visits with deceased family members cause him to rethink his easy dismissal. With no map for understanding these experiences, church members also feel uneasy, especially Nancy (Margo Martindale) who is bitter that that her son was taken while Todd's was spared.

Todd also has to endure ridicule from friends while young daughter Cassie (Lane Styles) is forced to physically defend her brother from unthinking taunts by schoolmates. Even Todd's best friend Jay (Thomas Haden Church), a banker and church board member, begins to pull away and Todd's position as pastor appears in jeopardy. Beset by doubts, he begins to question his own faith. Though he loves his son unconditionally and believes he is telling the truth, he cannot explain how the boy's experience fits in with his biblical teachings. Unfamiliar with children's near-death experiences, he does some research on the Internet and visits a psychology professor at the university (Nancy Sorel), but she offers little insight.

While Heaven is for Real can be moving and strives to maintain a balance, it is too simplistic in its depiction of a powerful and mysterious experience as just another feel-good story that reinforces Christian beliefs. The film also does not tell us that what people see in their near-death experiences depends on their own psychology, personal experiences, and cultural and religious upbringing. As Todd, Kinnear brings intelligence and sensitivity to his role and bolsters a story that could have become heavy-handed. Similarly, Corum is very convincing and rarely awkward as the little boy with the unusual story.

While it is definitely told from a Christian point of view, to its credit, the film's focus is less on religion than on the effect of Colton's NDE on the community and the bond between father and son. Even if you do not believe that Colton's epiphany provides a glimpse of what may await us in the afterlife, it is wise to reflect on the words of Albert Einstein who said, ""The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.""

Especially when the changes made to script and story not only offer no improvement, but are actually giant steps backward.""The Bishop's Wife,"" upon which this film is based, beats this one hands down in all major categories of story, direction, and acting. I even enjoyed the original soundtrack by Hugo Friedhofer far better, in spite of the fact that this film was obviously intended to be a vehicle to exploit Whitney Houston's vocal talent. (Does that remind you of another Whitney Houston vehicle co-starring Kevin Costner?)In the original movie, a need for an angel to be sent to the Bishop makes perfect sense...the bishop played by David Niven was obviously conflicted with earthly ambitions and had lost his way spiritually, sadly neglecting his wife and child in the process. In this remake, Denzel as Dudley the angel seems lost as to what his mission is. In fact, the Preacher often seems to be a better person than the angel in this version! The basic problem is that the Preacher is so dedicated in his role as pastor helping the sick and troubled ghetto kids, his time as a family man is understandably stretched thin. (Incidentally, there is a scene where Henry the preacher is spending quality time with his son, which even undercuts the film's attempt to construct this minor conflict.) Anyway, it all seems more like a job for a scheduling consultant than something as drastic as sending an angel down from heaven to perform ""miracles"".The Bishop's Wife was also made during a time when Hollywood did not shy away from Christian spiritual themes. While Cary Grant's Dudley the angel is clearly a messenger and servant of God, Denzel Washington's tired glances skyward seem to indicate a reluctant impatience with the Almighty that further contradicts his role and ultimate purpose in the story. And as can be expected in this era of movie sermonizing, humanism is the true ""savior"" celebrated on Christmas Day.A handsome cast with Denzel and Whitney, but lacking all the charm, subtle spiritual depth and cohesion of the original.",356,0,,0,"No reference.

Anthony Hopkins is well-cast as a mysterious man mourning the death of his little girl Audrey Rose, who perished in a car accident many years ago. He enters the lives of a New York City couple, claiming the soul of their preteen daughter Ivy once belonged to his child (he may be right, but what does he want done about it?). Hopkins is terrific in the film's early scenes, but eventually his speeches about reincarnation and the eternal struggle of souls become tiresome. As the girl's parents, Marsha Mason and John Beck are an unlikely couple; Mason's character (usually on the verge on tears) makes no sense, while vapid Beck is obviously out of his league alongside such acting heavyweights (occasionally twitching his model's mustache, so thick and perfect I expected someone to rip it off him). As the hapless Ivy, Susan Swift screams and cries convincingly enough, and I liked her hypnosis scene at the end, but she's an untrained child-actor with a limited range. Worst of all is a laughable courtroom sequence wherein a handicapped woman is wheeled in to tell her story and goes into such precise and incredible detail about a car wreck that ""Audrey Rose"" for a moment becomes a self-parody. Director Robert Wise, who interjects footage of natives and their reincarnation rituals into the mix, hasn't the visual style for this kind of material. The film has a dull, square look. There is a striking sequence involving a bonfire, and the well-mounted finale is nicely-done, but Wise is discreet in the worst way. He tiptoes around the plot-holes in the screenplay as if acknowledging them would be too rude.

The overall impression, however, is a mixed one: while Leibowitz is an undoubtedly talented artist, with a unique ability to capture images on film, it seems that she has become more concerned with photographing celebrities, rather than recording life around her. It seems that contemporary cultures are more preoccupied with worlds of surface that obfuscate rather than explore the truth. This is a shame, as Leibowitz's early career, as well as her subsequent work in the Bosnian civil war of the 1990s, reveal her to be a talented historian as well as a war photographer.",189,0,,0,"No reference.

654,1635022,2008-05-12,c-koch19,The Great Train Robbery (1941),9.0,"The plot of this film, as best I can remember it from 67 years ago was something like this. The bad guys, and in 1941 the bad guys had no redeeming character traits, decided to rob a train because it would be carrying an unusually valuable shipment in its baggage car. They needed more time than would be allotted if they merely stopped the train to perform the dastardly deed.What most people in the movie had forgotten about was a railroad siding that lead into a long since abandoned dead-ended tunnel. I do remember at the time that there was a logical reason for the tunnel's existence -- but 67 years! Give me a break, I don't remember what it was. Now the reason most people had forgotten about the railroad siding was that not only was the tunnel no longer of purpose but also the tracks leading into the tunnel were covered with a thin layer of sand that had simply blown over the tracks. So the bad guys stop the train and have it backed into the tunnel, the weight of the passenger cars and engine being enough to keep it on the tracks; tracks covered with that thin covering of sand. The train was backed into the tunnel and the tunnel entrance blasted shut. The wind quickly blew more sand over the tracks hiding all evidence of a train having passed over them and into the tunnel.Then the clever part; further up the tracks at a railroad crossing the villains set up a system of loud speakers and loudly played the sounds of the train passing by right on time at the very early AM. They telephoned a conductor living in the town, waking him so that he could hear the train go by. The train never arrived at it's destination.Now in 1941 at 13 years old I didn't much care about Arthur Conan Doyle. I just vividly remember parts of the film and hope that some day it becomes available on DVD. It sure was exciting way back then when just about all the characters in the film ""knew"" the train was somewhere between points b and c and I sat there really knowing that it was in that abandoned tunnel between points a and b.",380,0,,0,"No reference.

They're both set in girls' boarding schools and involve similar situations with female bonding and sadistic teachers, but there the similarities end. While watching MEMENTO MORI, it soon becomes apparent that this is an extremely atypical horror film: it's more of a touching, tragic love story between two lesbian school friends rather than anything else. It turns out that the director had no desire to make a ghost story featuring any of the traditional ghostly stuff from Asia, but the producers forced him to add some ethereal menace to appeal to the ready fan base.

I found the film to be one of two halves. The first forty-five minutes is stodgy, dull and slow: it's a depiction of school life full of interchangeable characters and unappealing sequences. I found little to keep me watching, but persevered nonetheless and was rewarded by an improved second half, which actually features intriguing plotting and some intelligent, well-filmed moments. The ghostly stuff is kept to a minimum other than in a few situations, and it works better that way.

657,5248043,2020-09-15,silaspanfil,Cuties (2020),8.0,"This movie at its core is about the performative expectations of young women in modern society and the conflict those expectations can cause.
The main character, Amy, is raised in a traditional Senegalese household and is taught that the exposed female form is to be derided and shamed. On the flip-side she is also a child in the late-2010's bombarded with the expectations of social media, and modern culture at large that prizes raw sexuality and fetishizes youth.Through the course of the film Amy finds that no matter which side she attempts to please or conform to, she finds herself fundamentally unhappy and both cultures, traditional and modern, find her lacking the necessary grace to be accepted.This film discusses the real world struggles for identity and acceptance that many girls deal with on a day-to-day basis, and highlights the stark contrast between the modern performative expectations of sexuality and a girl coming to own her sexuality in a healthy constructive way. Similarly, we see how even when cloistered from ""modern society"" in a Senegalese closed-community the expectations of sexual ownership and femininity are similarly fraught. This is displayed most prominently as Amy's mother finds her husband has taken a second wife without her approval and she (Amy's mother) is expected to carry this burden with grace and without protest.As for as the over-sexualization of the child performers is concerned, I can agree that some of the filmography lingers unnecessarily. I believe a greater distance from the performers would have given the audience a better perspective on what our culture expects (See: Tiktok, Instagram) versus the youth of the performers themselves. The film does not glorify the over-sexualized actions, it condemns them. The film never encourages you to ""enjoy"" these scenes, but to be made uncomfortable for good reason. Young girls should not have societal pressure to be ""performatively sexual enough"" for society. They deserve to come to explore and own their sexuality for themselves and themselves only.This is a nuanced film that deserves a nuanced viewing, and yes, a viewing. If you have not watched this movie in whole you should not be speaking on it. You are speaking from a position of chosen ignorance and even if your feelings about the film don't change after you have seen it, at least you have watched the source material whole-cloth.This is a story about individuality and shrugging off the mantle of societal expectation both modern and traditional.This is a very well told story and I give this movie an 8/10.",419,0,,0,"No reference.

659,2090027,2011-02-22,MBunge,Pressure (I) (2002),6.0,"Pressure is a low budget thriller with a well designed plot, a couple of compelling villains and a surprising number of thrills. The only thing it doesn't have is some gratuitous nudity and, frankly, this movie is good enough that it doesn't need it.Steve and Patrick (Kerr Smith and Lochlyn Munro) are a couple of med students driving through the back roads of Oregon. Steve's an uptight grinder who tries to keep everything under control. Patrick is the life of the party who skates through life with a smile on his face. They pull into a roadside bar which just happens to be hosting a college cheerleader convention. Patrick thinks he's in heaven, but Steve just wants to get back to his med student girlfriend Sara (Michelle Harrison). Patrick talks him into staying for one beer and while his buddy cavorts, Steve is propositioned by the ""bar hot"" Amber (Angela Featherstone).Against his better judgment, Steve follows her out into the parking lot but stops himself before it goes to far. Then Amber's fat faced boyfriend Bo (Adrien Dorval) whacks Steve in the head with a 2x4. They've made a little business out of mugging travelers like Steve and Bo drags him into the woods to have some fun. He pulls out a gun and starts shooting around Steve, until Bo accidentally shoots himself. Steve thinks he's been saved. Then Bo turns out to be a local deputy and calls for back up, claiming Steve shot him. That sends Steve and Patrick on the run, pursued by the county sheriff (Donnelly Rhodes) who happens to be Bo's father. As the carnage and death toll mounts, the FBI become involved and the media get hold of Steve's story, which brings Sara up to Oregon to see what she can do. As Steve and Patrick find themselves deeper and deeper in trouble, they have to go to greater and greater extremes to stay alive.Pressure is a fine example of how important plot is to making a successful melodrama. This isn't a production about subtle characterization or thematic depth. It's about the characters moving from crisis to crisis and barely managing to crawl out the other side. A story like this needs two things above all else. One is speed, and this film moves along at a crackerjack pace. There are not only no wasted scenes, there are hardly any wasted seconds. You can't overestimate the value of constant forward movement in this sort of movie.The second necessary thing is to have more than one thing going on. Melodramas are looked at as simpler and shallower than serious drama, but they do need a certain amount of narrative complexity to work well. They need to have multiple conflicts spread out amongst multiple characters, moving both in parallel and converging. Pressure, for example, does not just focus on Steve and Patrick's scramble to survive. It also has a subplot on the abusive relationship of Bo and Amber. He's a seething boil of resentment and insecurity who takes it all out on her and the pressure that builds up on Amber mirrors the tension that Steve is going through. And then there's a tertiary conflict between the sheriff and the FBI over who's going to catch Steve and additional levels of interpersonal strife between Patrick and Steve over who got them into this mess, Steve and Sara over what he did or didn't do with Amber and even Bo and his father.Those two characters and the men who play them are the real stars of this film. Bo is such a contemptible, stupid bully that after he gets shot in the dick once, you dislike him so much you want to see him get shot in the dick again. Adrien Dorval does a great job embodying just about every negative thing about overgrown boys who think they're men. Bo's father, on the other hand, is definitely a man. A blocky union of intensity and deliberation, the sheriff is able to hold life and death in his hands with equanimity. Donnelly Rhodes forcefully portrays one of the most imposing challenges any melodrama hero has ever run up against.Now, the last 20 minutes of Pressure is a bit too dependent on the sheriff getting far too kill crazy to be realistic and the film does seem to think it gave Steve more of a character arc than it actually did, but those are minor flaws.In the barren wasteland of low budget cinema, Pressure is an oasis of entertainment.

We have been waiting long time to see Bonnet get what he deserved so I don't mind that he is gone. Sure he was a great villain but I do agree that it was his time to go. I wouldn't want to see him trying to get his son through the courts. I also don't mind that he kidnapped Brianna. It was clear that he had some sort of feelings for her once she visited him in jail. I just think they took it too far. Once he took her she had to give her family time to find her so it was smart to go along with whatever he wanted but she should have shown him that she is more scared of him. Making him feel that if he treats her better then there might be a chance for them. Bonnet is not stupid and it's hard for me to believe he believed her until the kiss. No way he would buy that she wants to go back home to bring their son back to him. It was done alright but it could have been done much better.As to his capture and execution, no way Roger would be able to knock him down without a fight! Jamie, sure but not Roger. I also wanted to see Jamie punch him and take his revenge. Jamie should have captured him and then Roger could have beaten him up but Roger on his own, no way. I'm also not really happy that Brianna decided to give him to the authorities. Giving him another chance to escape was absolutely the wrong thing to do! I also not sure I believe the government would have helpEd them after the way Jamie and he ended things. As for the execution itself, drowning him was a good idea because he told Bree he was afraid of the ocean (although he wasn't in the ocean but still). I just wish she hadn't shot him. He escaped the scariest part of all, the second the water get so high up that he can feel the end. I think she did it out of mercy and sorry but I really don't like it. He robbed and killed and raped and mutilated people and was not even sorry for a minute. Once he decided he doesn't believe her (after the kiss) he was willing to sell the mother of his child like a piece of garbage. He didn't deserve mercies! And we should have seen Jamie take his revenge. As much as I dislike Roger, he was right that Brianna is his wife and he should be the on to kill him (or Bree if she wanted to) but Jamie (the main and most important character) should have at least be the one who caught him and made him hurt.With some small changes this episode could have easily been a 10/10.",522,1,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

However, as with ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""The Lady Vanishes"", I adored it on the second viewing. Kathleen Turner is excellent in the title role, playing the world weary 43-year-old Peggy Sue who finds herself in the body of her 17-year-old self to perfection. Nicolas Cage, the nephew of the director Francis Ford Coppola, is every bit her equal as her future husband Charlie. This is a very successful example of nepotism, something for which the Coppola family is well known. In recent years, he's become almost a parody of himself and has starred in some awful films but this is one of his best ones.The film has a very strong supporting cast with the exception of Sofia Coppola, a less successful example of nepotism. What's really interesting about it is that it features three actors (Cage, Jim Carrey and Joan Allen) near the beginning of their careers who went on to bigger things in major or supporting roles and lovely cameos from three elderly actors (Leon Ames in his final film, Maureen O'Sullivan and John Carradine) at or near the end of theirs. Coincidentally, I've seen the latter three in films from the 1930s and/or 1940s in the last few weeks so it's fascinating to see them in later life.The premise of the film is relatively simple but it's extraordinarily effective, extremely relatable and timeless. We all wonder what it would be like to live our lives over again knowing what we do now and we all wish that we could see dead parents, grandparents, etc. so we can tell them how much we love them and miss them.

Most of Machete's critics that have given overall negative reviews, have fallen into a trap of their own devices. Machete is an exploitation film and was advertised as such. By definition, and exploitation film will include excessive violence, gore, nudity, and be high on intentional corny lines while low on plot devices and character development. To give low ratings to Machete because of one's distaste for the genre, would be like saying ""The Shinning was awful because I don't like horror."" This is one of Rodriguez best films to date, side by side with Sin City (2005). Machete delivers on all accounts of action, gore, nudity, and corny lines. The plot is simple, but honestly, that's how it should be. The thing that sets this apart from other exploitation films is that the acting is top notch. I personally found that the three main female characters to be the most intriguing and diverse.Jessica Alba plays the part of an ICE agent struggling with her loyalty to her nation and her people. She slowly begins to question her own logic on if people should follow law simply because they are laws. We see this struggle immediately, when she approaches a taco stand (apparently once every week) to by a coffee and lunch, despite her own people feeling from her site. Why does she continue this ritual? She says it is to check the papers of the character Luz, but really it is to try and hold onto a sliver of identity among her people. Michelle Rodriguez plays said Luz (aka She) as an underground leader of illegal immigration. The character of Luz is a simple woman who believes in not bending to the broken system, but fighting for her people (the mirror image of Alba). ""She"" is only a myth on which Luz has built a cult following, understanding that sometimes being a myth can do more damage than flesh and blood. By the end of the film, Luz is reborn as the mythical She, just in time for the bloody battle.Finally, the actress that surprised me the most was Lindsay Lohan. Despite only receiving 10-15 minutes of screen time (most are which she is undressed), she plays her character perfectly and flawlessly. The role seems to be written specifically for her and I applaud her for stepping up and taking on such a mature role. One of her first scenes is a tongue-in-cheek conversation about how she needs to give the people of the internet what they want, and that is more of her. Lohan played the part beautifully (in all aspects) and specks of talent are clearly visible. I hope that filmmakers and audiences (as well as herself) continue to allow her opportunities to showcase that talent. Machete is an exploitation film at its finest. And, for the most part, if you are the type of cinema attendee who wants to see a movie called Machete in the first place, chances are you will be thoroughly entertained.",513,1,,0,"No reference  The review focuses entirely on describing the film itself, analyzing its elements, and the author's personal experience watching it.

674,3901412,2018-12-17,ElMaruecan82,The Quiet Man (1952),8.0,"In 1941, John Ford directed one of his best and most personal movies: ""How Green Was My Valley"" it was also his only Best Picture.The film was a nostalgic ride over a Welsh mining town shot in all black-and-white so both of the titular green and Maureen O'Hara fiery red hair were left to our imagination. The monochrome choice had also the merit to camouflage the Californian setting, as war made any overseas shooting impossible.Interestingly, despite the 'Welsh' cultural mark, the film was also a tribute to Ford's Irish ancestry. He even challenged purists by having many Irish actors play Welsh characters. It is possible that Ford thought this was the closest he would get to his roots so he let his sentimental self take the command of the camera. In 1951, he finally had the opportunity to honor Eire by adapting short story by Maurice Walsh, whose rights were bought in the early 30s.But how can one possibly imagine a tribute to Ireland in black-and-white or devoid of that so particular green? The Emerald Isle was a jewelry box out of which John Ford had to forge a gem... and it was ""The Quiet Man"", a film of temper and tenderness... and for once, a really green valley! You just can't cheat with the old country especially since no war has raised its ugly head to prevent Ford from taking a long vacation and bring his long-time partner John Wayne and the beautiful Maureen O'Hara for what would be one of his signature films.With ""The Quiet Man"", John Ford finally proves his statement right as he said: ""None of my so called better pictures are westerns."" I've enjoyed many of his Westerns but I admired the non-Western ones for the temperament they deployed without any fancy directing or elaborate storytelling, Ford just knew how to get the right effects. And ""The Quiet Man"" for that matter puts you immediately at ease, like the first sips of a pint of Guinness.Though the opening credits use a beautiful coastal view under a bright sunset, the film doesn't lay the green color at first but starts with the stranger's homecoming. Sean Thornton, the American coming back to his native Ireland and asking for a village named Insfree, a simple question that sets the tone and invite the first chuckles. So we'll deal with the colorful and sentimental Ireland and John Wayne didn't come to kick some ass or start some quarrel. In this appeasing mood, we appreciate his welcoming by the elfin-like Michaeleen played by the irresistible Barry Fitzgerald.The town's matchmaker (and occasional bookmaker) discovers that the big hunk of a man (one foot taller) is the little Sean he saw grow up and move to Pittsburgh, back to claim the land that belonged to his deceased parents, determined to start a new life in the green cradle. The exposition allows us to encounter in once all the players of that farcical melodrama. Ward Bond is the town priest. Catching Sean's eye is Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate Danaher, the turbulent sister of Squire Will Danaher, a loud-mouthed self-centered bully (a scene-stealing over-the-top,Victor McLaglen) who won't have any outsider stepping on his territory, let alone the land he intends to buy from the rich Widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick).This will obviously complicate the love story going between Sean and Mary Kate, till marriage and even beyond. There might be bar brawls and big fistfights but maybe because there's always something worth all these shenanigans and deep inside, the Irish people are all proud of their traditions. Sean Thornton will learn at his expenses why America might have some roots in Ireland but is not Ireland. And it takes some great deal of courage from Wayne to play the part of a man branded as coward because in this cultural immersion.Of course he has his reasons and we know it's only a matter of time before the two distinguished gentlemen let the fists talk but ""The Quiet Man"" hides behind its comedic and romantic façade a great deal of knowledge about Ireland's traditions and the way they forged the temperament of many Americans whether born in the country or in America. There are many parts in the film that would be considered politically incorrect by our standards, but who would dare to call Wayne abusive or O'Hara submissive? The couple is certainly not mismatched when it comes to principles.Some would take a dowry as a symbol of oppressive patriarchy but Mary Kate isn't concerned with the money but what it represents, her emancipation, she's unchained by an institution like everyone else but not her free will. It's actually the men who learn humbling lessons in the film as if sometimes, one should consider the value of traditions before embracing everything from the modernity. Well, it's possible that the film has a few chauvinistic undertones but they never to be taken seriously, and well, sometimes the old-fashioned ways have their charm, and d it's precisely because a movie like ""The Quiet Man"" aged a lot that it feels so new and exhilarating.Ever since I discovered Ireland, I had a soft spot for that country and I envy those who have that tradition pumping in their blood, not denying mine of course, but it's a credit to John Ford to have made such a beautiful tribute to Ireland, visually and musically (that Victor Young's theme) that it probably made a few viewers, secretly wish they would be Irish.And just because nothing dramatic affects the film doesn't mean it's not entertaining and even thrilling in its own way, it's as quiet as its hero, calm and comprehensive on the surface but has with a few tricks under its sleeve... and knows how to make your heart pound, your jaw drop and your belly laugh!",968,0,,0,"No reference.

A promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution. My Super Ex-Girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience. What went wrong? The cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and I didn't like the way they played it out. I was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film. However, they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho. It just wasn't very fresh and after about forty minutes, the film wore out it's welcome. Sure, there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out.

Director Ivan Reitman has lost his touch. After a successful run in the eighties and early nineties, he started making crap like Evolution and Father's Day. I wouldn't say My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a complete bust but I don't give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds, which isn't too much. Don Payne did an awful job with the screenplay. The majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just one-note. He also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times.

A few of the actors were good enough to save the film. Uma Thurman was great as G-Girl and she had many funny lines. Luke Wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting. I don't think he makes for an appealing leading man and he's better in supporting roles like in The Family Stone. Anna Faris was just doing her ""Scary Movie"" routine and it's getting a little old. She needs a challenge or at least some better scripts. Wanda Sykes is either hit or miss for me. She was great in Monster-In-Law and she was bad in Clerks 2. Here, she is just annoying and doesn't bring anything to the movie. Eddie Izzard was alright, nothing special. Rainn Wilson was just annoying and not funny. Overall, I was disappointed with the movie. It wasn't awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average. Rating 5/10",438,0,,0,"No reference.

The familiar elements of the Star Wars universe, overlaid with realistic warfare that has never been so front and center in a Star Wars movie, lays the groundwork for a truly astounding story and action packed movie experience. Indeed there are a few drawn out scenes and mundane monologues building up to larger story arcs as there is with any movie at over 120 minutes in length. After all, how else would Hollywood make our $20 IMAX 3D tickets worth the price tag. But what viewers gets in return for their patience as the story tellers lay the necessary ground work in Act 1 and 2 is an astounding Act 3 that lands blows the audience may not have been expecting. The ending battle sequence is fantastic visually and does wonders with respect to proper pace, relevant content, and of course X-Wings, lots and lots of X-Wings. The creators of this movie from day one declared this movie a spin-off film, making it very clear that they would be slightly veering from the normal Star Wars form of story telling while still respecting the universe in which it exists. This remained consistent when the title logo was released without the ever so recognizable franchise insignia, the introduction of the ""A Star Wars Story"" tag line, and a promise of no opening crawl. And that's exactly what we got. A story set within the Star Wars universe that contained a perfect addition of brand new elements, purposeful hints of old elements, and a climax that forces the crimson red blood in viewers hearts to pump with vigor until the closing credits roll.

1. Amazing acting from most of the cast. Especially the professor. This is what carries the show.
2. Some of the script. The clever ideas from the professor, like when they switch the masks of everybody so the two SWAT team guys cannot infiltrate. Also when they put a hidden microphone in the glasses of Angel.
3. Good intro song.
4. Great disguises of the heroes when they finish the heist.
5. Bella Ciao song.Bad Things
1. It was nice one time when the Denver and Berlin pulled Guns at each other in the toilet, because Denver was in love with Monica. However, after that this trick of ""pulling guns at each other without shooting"" has been used sooo many times that it is too much.
2. Characters creating drama for no reason, just to make something happen or to help the plot. For example, when Tokyo suddenly pulls a gun on Berlin (Russian roulette), and then later Berlin throws her out of the bank. This was a very stupid decision from Tokyo, and no one would do that in real life.
3. Berlin Sacrificing himself in the end, when there was no need for it. They could just have gone in the tunnel and then blow it up. A person sacrificing himself is already a cliché, so when it is being used it must make sense and be very clever.
4. The SWAT team waited to storm the building until the LAST MOMENT when the robbers finished to print all the money. In the begging they were worried about hostages and in the end they didn't care. That is a very sudden change of mind from the police/government, which is convenient for the plot. I think that they should either storm the building right away, or not storm it at all to try and save the hostages.
5. When the SWAT team actually storm the building, we see the most stupid and unrealistic gun fight. Both sides shoot at each other for a long time and no one gets killed.
6. The scene with Tokyo is coming back through the main door on a motorcycle WITHOUT GETTING SHOT. That is just unbelievable and unrealistic. Even when the professor saves her from an armed police transportation, that is just too much. I mean these guys are already stealing 2,4 billion euro or whatever, but now they also have to be like superman/wonder woman and get Tokyo away from an armed police truck. Tokyo should not have been acting stupid from the beginning and then all that other stuff would not have happened.
7. Not everything has to be in the last second. Raquel gives the address of professors secret location to the Swat team, and they storm the place 1-2 minutes after the heroes escape
8. The scene where the professor smashes the coffee cup from grandmothers hand. If the grandmother cannot remember that, then how the is she able to take care of her granddaughter and herself?
9. Unrealistic portrayal of gunshot wounds. When Arturo and Monica get shot, they get a small surgery and in a couple of days they are okay. In real life, if someone gets shot in the shoulder or in the leg, they would probably take months if not years to recover. I don't know the exact timeline, but it is not a few days. You can google it if you want.
10. Like other reviewers have pointed out, they are the bad guys, so it does not make sense to just let them get away with the money to live in Paradise. Instead maybe they could have burned the money and give some sort of message to the government. It is like the movie ""Inside Man"" where they also rob a bank, but they don't take any money, they only steal some documents to bring down a corrupt former nazi guy. Or maybe they should just end up in jail, I don't know what exactly, but there has to be some consequences or some good-moral-reason-explanation to why they are doing it. Or else this whole ""resistance"" and bella ciao theme does not make sense if they just drink Pina Colada in the Caribbean.

I've watched it twice and I'd willingly see it again.The acting is the one aspect that seems to win universal approval, and deservedly so, particularly that of Anne Hathaway. But I think it's the writer who deserves the most kudos. What I found most startling about the film was the accuracy with which it portrayed the self-absorption of drug addicts. Anybody with one in the family will recognize the symptoms on display here. More particularly, it's a feature that can be exacerbated by stints in rehab. Not that I'm decrying rehab in any way, but the intense focus in these sessions on ""self"" tends to produce even more self-obsessed people. Which can be a bit hard for others to take, as superbly demonstrated by Hathaway in this movie.The other character I was fascinated with was the mother/mother-in-law portrayed by Debra Winger. This character was a dead-ringer for someone I know only too well - wanting to keep the oar in, but strictly from a distance, with plenty of ready escape routes at hand. The writer of these characters should be congratulated.I guess the one beef I might have is why American parents in films such as this always seem to be so well off.

But, gradually at first, then quickly, the plot seemed to lose cohesion and continuity. I could not tell how much time had elapsed between the scenes, and I am pretty sure there were some chronological inconsistencies that I do not now recall. If you have yet to see this cinematic abomination, leave when the protagonist's love interest leaves for England, because things are about to become absolutely unbearable. I saw the flick on a date and almost abandoned her due to the unsettling waves of cringing-shamefulness coursing through my cerebellum all the way down to my socks via my spine and sciatica. Had I been there alone, I would no doubt have biffed my Coke at the screen and walked out. But I could see that my date was loving the film, needless to say, I lost all respect for her and never called her again. It seemed designed to indulge someone's weird sugar coated fantasies. Just pure cringe. The cringe peaks at the end gig, they were supposed to be a bunch of kids playing at the school disco, but there were violins and all sorts in the mix of these utterly dreadful songs that were clearly not written by teenage boys. There was that terrible scene with the headmaster, in which the plug would literally have been pulled on the band; to say nothing of that 1950s Americana scene which almost made me defecate in my trousers. And when you thought 'OK, this must be it, the credits will surely save me', it continues. There's a particularly bad scene with the older miserable brother, where he said ""you know I used to play guitar"" and his younger brother is all surprised; how could you not know that your brother - who lives in the same house as you - plays an instrument?! Even though it started OK, the fact that it became such an omni- shambles as it progressed did irreversible and retrospective damage to the entire movie.

She was still slim (possibly even slimmer than Lauren Bacall, who'd recently had her second child) and her face looked relatively youthful. So why did she look 45? I concluded it was the hair.

Its not as good as Tom and Jerry, The Smurfs or other great Hanna Barbera cartoons. Still there are lots of great things in it. Hanna Barbera Productions revived Droopy and Spike. Sometimes a villain can make a film or a show very memorable. I think this is the case with Tom and Jerry Kids. I thought Frank Welker's portrayal of McWolf made the show very memorable. Don Messick did a great job playing Droopy. Charles Adler also did a great job playing Dripple. Some of Droopy and Dripple shorts were good and others were just OK. But Frank Welkers's portrayal of McWolf made many of these OK shorts memorable. It must be noted that the show also has a wonderful animation. My favorite Droopy and Dripple short is Droopio and Juliet. Another thing I liked about Tom and Jerry Kids is ""sometimes"" villain characters win at the end of the short. For Example, McWolf wins at the end of the short ""A Thousand Clones."" Droopy Delivers is another short with a good ending.In Tom and Jerry Kids shorts, Young Tom also wins on some occasions. I like the idea of fair game in a cartoon. My favorite tom and Jerry short is Tulliver's Twist.To me, even a weak Hanna Barbera cartoon is better than many cartoons that is released today. Hanna Barbera made wonderful cartoons like Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, Jonny Quest, The Flinstones.

Leni Riefenstahl was not a bad actress at all but was an even better director (the latter of which she is perhaps better known for and her personal life), and when it came to films centered around adversity in the mountains it didn't get much better than Arnold Fanck when it came to direction at that particular point in film history.So it did sadden me that 'The Holy Mountain' didn't connect with me completely, being somebody that really did want to like it as Riefenstahl's directing efforts and her other mountaineering-oriented outings with Fanck have much to admire. Visually 'The Holy Mountain' is a triumph and there is some inspired direction, but it is far from exceptional story-wise and Riefenstahl went on to do much better things when her acting style matured and became more subtle and comfortable (neither of which evident here).'The Holy Mountain' has a good deal of good things. Visually it is masterly. The scenery is beautiful and atmospheric but even better is the cinematography. Not only are there some truly breathtaking images, but the moving camera and time lapse photography are so well used and make what happens raw and moving and the points of view interesting. It is a hauntingly scored film again and written with sincerity and good intentions.Fanck's direction has a lot of impressive parts, especially when capturing the intensity of the action and emotional impact of it. As there are intense and moving moments here.On the other hand, the story tends to be very dull and not particularly eventful, which may be down to that there is not a lot to it structurally and the film tried to pad it out. It is also excessively melodramatic, especially later on when it got very overwrought. The characters are underdeveloped and quite sketchy even.Generally, the acting is nothing special and Riefenstahl herself went on to much better after. Here she overdoes it quite dreadfully and Fanck's direction of her is all over the shop.In conclusion, watchable but underwhelming. 5/10",356,0,,0,"No reference.

Boy looks are sure deceiving. Now don't get me wrong it was a good movie but, it wasn't a great movie like it could have been. The cast was good because Catherine and John have been in another movie (High Fidelity) where they played a couple and yes it was believable. Julia of course played her cute, normal self. But, I really think that this was not her best movie. Pretty Woman, Dying Young, Sleeping with the Enemy, Mystic Pizza, and Steel Magnolias are a few of her best movies. John Cusackis a good actor who would rather do silly romantics or pure comedy. All his movies in the eighties to the nineties were very good even 2000 was good.

What was the deal with that clinic that was not funny, and Hank Azaria's character got boring fast.

It's compelling, convincing, and yet, as a story, ever so slightly pointless: 'Satruday Night Fever' had its own redemption narrative, and while one can mock this as Hollywood softening, without any such story a film can seem slightly devoid of direction: it's hard to even imagine what a happy ending would have been for 'Tony Manero', so hopeless is the initial premise.

I don't know how this got a 7.5 average rating when this finale episode sucked so bad. Wrapping things up with that obnoxious 'Chameleon' character was far-fetched, but seeing that plane explode with him on it was quite satisfying. The flashbacks with Reid while he was in a coma were exactly the schmaltzy scenes that you'd expect from such a premise, but having his schizo mom as the one to decide what kind of medical procedures he should get was absolutely ludicrous. A man as practical and pragmatic as Reid would never let his literally crazy mother be the one to decide whether he lives or dies.The last almost half of the show focused on Garcia, who was arguably the most annoying and inane character on the entire show. I can't believe the producers let her write the finale and focus mostly on herself - wretched choice! I can see why so many reviewers hated this episode for that very reason - it was completely stupid and left a bad taste in the viewers' mouths.

713,2164178,2011-08-11,ElMaruecan82,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969),8.0,"If my review was a medical diagnosis, I would say ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" suffers from a benign case of cinematic schizophrenia, just as if ""The Sting"" featured a scene similar to the tollbooth massacre in ""The Godfather"".As much as I genuinely enjoyed ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", I had the strange feeling the film was constantly hesitating between two different approaches : comedy or drama, and if only had the director, George Roy Hill made a choice in both, the movie would've been perfect. And here is the first dilemma: as a comedy, it features some of the funniest lines and exchanges from American Cinema, which made the friendship more appealing in its comical aspect, and didn't fit the courses of dramatic events that would lead to the heroes' demise. While ""The Wild Bunch"" was a dramatic friendship story, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" had to be a buddy movie.My mention of Peckipah's iconic and superior film is not fortuitous. It has a lot in common with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" as both film embody the agony of the Old West myth through the introductions of new vehicles such as the car for the 'bunch' and the bicycle for the 'Butch', and the similar plot lines featuring tough guys running away, whether it's from a bunch of bounty hunters or a posse, the escape is like a symbolic exile, when the civilization has conquered the west and the only valuable direction is the South, Mexico or Bolivia  countries not contaminated by the progress, where the vestiges of the Old West still remain, where banks can still be robbed.The modern take on the Western genre is not without a bit of nostalgia, on which the use of sepia in both films is the most eloquent expression. However, western is a difficult genre to handle and probably the less compatible with the genre-binding approach. You can amplify its effects, as did Sergio Leone, increase its level of violence like Sam Peckinpah, transcend its ugliness to a hypnotic documentary-like realism like Altman with ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" or turning it into a sweet enchanting romantic comedy with self-derision as the best way to translate the way of old west frontier idealism, like ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"". But as tempting as it is, you can't do everything and I felt like Hill wanted to try every tendency to stay on the safe side, and as a credit to his talent, it's a miracle that it didn't ruin the film.Although I admire the directorial job of George Roy Hill, I suspect the desire to do something modern was inspired from the current streaks of realistic films of the 'New Hollywood' era. I mentioned, ""Wild Bunch"", ""The Graduate"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" emulated in both the opening and the concluding scene. The last shootout was a deliberate way to keep a touch of realism in the film, reminding that guns needed to be loaded too. And the explosion during the bank robbery is one of the most convincing and spectacular from any film, even by today's standards. Now, how could such perfectionism have allowed the dramatic scene when they kill the Bandidos, the slow motion was ridiculously over the top, it didn't fit the film at all. And the film features many moments that shouldn't have been there. The script introduces us to funny or colorful characters like the News reader from the gang, or the scene-stealer Strother Martin, and the way they act label them as comic relief characters, and then they are instantly killed, in the coldest and most brutal way. The shocking effect made me feel cheated. The movie's mood had to be a cheerful comedy with some dramatic undertones, and the running gag involving the Woodcock character would never have me expected the film to turn in such a dramatic series. The movie had to be a Western ""Sting"".The film's modernity relies more efficiently on its spicy humor, and the great score from Burt Bacharach, which provide a smooth iconoclast, feel to a film. But I guess the movie finally grew on me, thanks to the great chemistry going between Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and how the two characters completed each other. The lines they exchange are priceless, and full of wit, the cliff scene, the Bolivia arrival, or the issues with Spanish languages were absolutely hysterical, the kind of humor all relying on timing and body languages and that creates the charm of such movies like ""The Graduate"". It's ironic that the movie features Katharine Ross, Ellen Robinson, again in the middle of a love triangle, but Etta Place, not the typical female action-killjoy, was the icing on the cake that provided the romantic touch and a reason for the delightful musical interludes, on the top of them, one of the film's defining moments, the bicycle ride.All the way, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is the perfect example of a great film that could have been even greater if the director stay focused on one specific tone. I learned in the commentary that Hill was surprised at Newman's lack of seriousness while playing Butch, but it was the right tone, how could you make a drama out of such an outstanding script. William Goldman's Oscar-winning screenplay is a comedic goldmine transcended by Newman and Redford's chemistry, a perfect comedy works on the body languages, the looks, at one point, there's one smile Redford gives, and never had a smile made me laugh so hard.""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is redeemed by its wit, its beautiful cinematography by the master Conrad Hall, the score, the acting, and more than anything, its entertaining value. It's a classic, entertaining, Western but it could have been a masterpiece of unconventionality",965,0,,0,"No reference.

714,1737713,2008-12-16,ddsterrell,The Dark Knight (2008),8.0,"I am a little amazed by so many rave reviews. I did enjoy this film, but it is also seriously flawed, and that needs to be considered. Its running length was long, it was way too complicated and hard to follow, and (I can't shake this) the female lead was miscast. The first criticism may not be significant, given how long many films routinely are these days and the fact that this can easily be forgiven if it all works and one is entertained (as in ""Lord of the RIngs"", for example). But a convoluted and hard-to-follow story is a serious plotting fault and this movie has it in spades. I personally attribute this to a modern ""Video Game"" mentality and to this film probably being oriented toward a young audience reared on those games. The plot and sub plots jump all over the place and are hard to follow, some sub plots lead nowhere, often-unrecognizable characters jump in and out, and scenes are not fully fleshed out. This all creates a hyperactive feeling to the film. In a sense this works because the Joker, himself, is crazy, so that fits, and because so much eye candy is constantly being thrown at the viewers to keep them entertained. Repeated viewings will probably go a long way to clearing up many details and convoluted areas, but a good story shouldn't need that to be fully understandable. The casting of Maggie Gyllenhaul as Rachel Dawes just felt wrong to me; she is not a very attractive woman, more goofy-looking, and didn't seem to bring much weight or sizzle to the role, especially the romantic scenes. Last, and relatively minor in this age, the film is ""volume-impaired""  at times demanding seriously higher volume to understand a quiet conversation and then a major reduction in volume for the next dramatic sequence. I suspect, however, that this wouldn't bother a lot of young people who routinely listen to over-amped car and game sound systems. Worth praise foremost is Heath Ledger's take on the Joker, the great special effects and the Batpod, and the new slant on Batman as a dark scapegoat. Bottom line, however, is that in the overall scheme of things, this was not THAT great a film. Fun, good, not great. Sorry, but ""Batman Returns"" was a much better scripted and paced film.

717,1307725,2006-10-11,EUyeshima,Saving Face (2004),7.0,"First-time feature director/screenwriter Alice Wu's 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it, but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling, unforced humor and a trio of winning performances. With a conflicted protagonist at its core, the film shares the same soufflé-light rom-com territory as Ol Parker's half-hearted ""Imagine Me and You"" and Ian Iqbal Rashid's overly cute ""A Touch of Pink"". Wu, however, manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly, because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes.The plot focuses on Wil, short for Wilhelmina, an obviously talented Manhattan-based surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional Chinese family living across the East River in Flushing. Referred to just as ""Ma"" in the story, her mother is a widowed beautician, who only speaks Mandarin to her daughter and keeps flinging potential suitors at her. Wil's eyes, nevertheless, are set squarely on a comely ballerina named Vivian, who happens to be the daughter of Wil's supervising surgeon at the hospital. Meantime, Ma is in her own pickle as she finds herself pregnant and subsequently ejected from the family home. Ma moves in with Wil, and the inevitable consequences ensue. There are affecting moments of lightness and gravitas throughout, but much of the charm of the film comes naturally from the three leads.As Wil, Michelle Krusiec is a terrific find, evoking the simmering turmoil of her situation in unexpected ways even when the script fails her at times. Lynn Chen is saucy and inviting as Vivian, though I wish we could have seen one scene where she dances onstage since such a strong point is made on what style she wants to pursue. Both actresses make the attraction between the characters palpable, culminating in the inevitable girl-on-girl scene. Despite the beauty of her younger co-stars, Joan Chen is almost too gorgeous to be playing such an emotionally constrained character. Even though her character is supposed to be closing in on fifty, Chen is just 43 and frankly looks ensconced in her thirties, making her the rare case of looking far younger at the end of the movie than at the beginning. Yet, she is able to convey the necessary brittle, distanced manner as Ma, making her character's self-discovery process more rewarding.The ending is on the pat side, especially a silly multiple confessional at a wedding and a wedged-in riff on ""The Graduate"", but it doesn't compromise the sweet-natured charm of the piece. Special mention should go to Harlan Bosmajian's cinematography, which captures the saturated colors found in the Chinese-American community. The 2005 DVD contains Wu's thoughtful commentary on a separate track, as well as several deleted scenes, a standard, ten-minute making-of featurette and a rather dull Sundance video diary.",473,0,,0,"No reference.

""Toy Story 3"" successfully continues the Pixar tradition of excellence in animation and film story-telling that began 15 years ago with the first ""Toy Story."" I don't know how they do it but the excellent screenwriters was able to shake up the old ""Toy Story"" themes of abandonment, friendship and loyalty into this wonderful script bursting with fresh humor, exciting action and above all, rich and heart-warming emotion. Never mind that we were watching toys on screen, but these characters were as real as people we hold dear. We are drawn into their dilemmas and we root for them to find their salvation.That hyper-exciting nail-biting scene in the garbage-disposal facility is a masterpiece in suspense. I was in awe at the vivid and highly complex sequence of animation on screen. When I looked at my 8 year old son beside me, he too was in total awe. It was amazing.If the last Pixar film ""Up"" made us cry in the first 10 minutes, I think there was no dry eye in the theater (especially adults) in the last 10 minutes of ""Toy Story 3"". The sincerity of the dialogue and the highly charged execution was beautiful. Even that final catch in Andy's breath as he finally drove off to college was so intense with emotion.The voice acting was pitch perfect, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who got Woody and Buzz down pat. The new duo of Ken (voiced by Michael ""Batman"" Keaton) and Barbie (voiced by Jodi ""Little Mermaid"" Benson) was very funny.What more superlatives can I write to convince you to watch this special film?

720,1236709,2006-07-06,tuttle-46,High Tension (2003),9.0,"!!!Major Spoilers Ahead!!! From all the comments I've seen about this movie, on Amazon.com and on this website, most of the complaints have to do with how ""irrational"" or ""absurd"" the ending is. The key to understanding the ending is to understand that the division of the main character into two people is not a literal, physical division. IT IS FIGURATIVE.Many have harped on the fact that because the girl and the man are driving two separate vehicles in the chase scene and she is wounded in the wreckage, the fact that she and the man are the same person doesn't make sense. Let me explain again: IT IS FIGURATIVE. It is not meant to be indicative of what happens to her body, but what is happening to her mind.In plain English: the good side of her (the girl) is fighting the evil side of her (the man) for dominance. When she beats him up with the barb-wire post, she is trying to reclaim her compassion and humanity. When he runs her off the road, he is trying to establish his deranged superiority. In plainer English: Duh.This also explains why he can anticipate her evasive moves with intelligence. Things that normal stupid slashers wouldn't take into account, he does - and with breathtaking suspense. He is more canny than your average slasher and she is more savvy than your average heroine. This is because he IS her and the two parts of her consciousness have some rudimentary communication. For example, he checks the sink in her guest bathroom to see if it's been used. She has already wiped it down. He lifts up the foot of the mattress. She has anticipated this and has drawn her feet up. In the gas station, he has a suspicion that the clerk was ""looking at"" something. The security camera while he's in the store is showing us what SHE thinks it would show. She takes the gun, but he's already taken the bullets. Most of the movie is from HER point of view - which means a lot of what happens is in her imagination. Again, IT IS FIGURATIVE.It may have escaped attention that the head fellating the man at the beginning of the film looks amazingly like Alex's head? Why would the swing be empty just after Marie sees Alex naked in the shower? Is it just coincidence that during Marie's masturbation scene, the man pulls up in the van, getting ready to do his business? Could it be that her attraction to Alex is the trigger?C'mon people. This is not lazy film-making. It is existential film-making and lazy film-watching. Turn off your reality TV (the true opiate of the masses). Replace it with about an hour of introspective thinking a night. Ponder the universe inside your navel. Let the thinking side of your brain (the good side) overcome the indolent side of your brain (the bad side). Repeat until you feel your analytical powers returning to you. Read ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" for good measure.Now go back and see this movie again (if you can stomach it), and pay attention this time!",526,1,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

I don't think the bear was purposely trying to hurt him because it appeared that the dog was more aggressive. The bear was just trying to evade him. But anyway, I think the whole point to this film is that friendships are very powerful if both parties really care for one another like the way Fish Hawk and Corby did. I feel that Fish Hawk was like a second father figure to Corby. Too many times people take friendships for granted and as a result of it, many friendships never last long. I know this from personal, first-hand experience.But the real sad part of this story is when the lady of the house went behind Fish Hawk's back to make racist remarks! It was not only her. It was also the family's friends who made racist comments such as the visiting doctor who had no right to say the things he said. All the other family friends tried forcing alcohol down Fish Hawk's throat but he stood his ground and told them all to just back off. In the end, Fish Hawk was the class act, as is the case with many Natives today, they're all class act people because they will take anyone in if you ever need them and their help.

729,1842711,2009-08-13,chuck-526,Tulpan (2008),7.0,"I watched Tulpan for the second time last night. It seems to me the movie is really about how different people react to wrenching changes, mostly by nursing a fantasy of some sort. Among other things Tulpan documents the _current_ way people and sheep use that steppe, which under the surface isn't very nice.As the ""yurt"" is a touchstone with the past, it's commonly retained even though it doesn't actually make much sense any more. These herdsmen move very infrequently (if at all), and these yurts are typically surrounded by outbuildings that look pretty permanent. What good really is a moving house if you don't move? The person who insists Asa must be married before getting any sheep is ""Comrade Boss"" (not brother-in-law Ondas - Asa and Ondas have their differences, but the assignment of sheep is not among them). Ondas and his family cannot move without approval from the Boss. The Boss controls the only veterinarian and most of the vehicles. The Boss tells Ondas he's responsible for every stillborn lamb. All this adds up to the current economic pattern in that area: herds of sheep belong to non-resident owners, who ""contract"" their care to the actual herdsmen. The herdsmen live sort of like their ancestors, but don't actually own most of the sheep, seldom move, and don't have all that much freedom.Daughter Beke (and also to some extent her mother and Asa's sister Samal) appear to cope with the dichotomy between the idealized life and the actual life of a herdsman's family by rather defiantly singing lots of folk songs. Perhaps the folk songs are just the most visible sign of fantasizing the old ways.Tractor driver Boni survives the dichotomy by diving deeply into a fantasy pastiche of music, sex, and wealth. He's the conduit to the ""outside"", and so is more worldly than the herdsmen he serves. But by more objective standards he's woefully uninformed too. At one point he speaks of bypassing the city and going directly to Sakhalin Island. Never mind that Sakhalin Island is in a different country thousands of miles away through several other countries.Asa appears to survive the dichotomy by remaining completely unaware of it. He admires a solar panel in a magazine, without ever realizing no herdsman could possibly afford such a thing. He admires a motorcycle in the magazine too, but without ever reflecting such a thing would be useless without a reasonably accessible supply of gasoline. He compliments Tulpan on wanting to go to college at the same time he wants her to marry him, without any sense that it might be difficult to do both. The scene he draws on his collar is of an idealized herdsman with healthy children (not the half-crazy kids he actually lives with), his own herd of sheep, more wealth than any real herdsman ever had, and the freedom to move wherever he wishes whenever he wishes.Brother-in-law Ondas clings to the old ways even though they don't quite add up any more. He invests a lot of time and effort in quixotic visits to Tulpan's yurt that are doomed from the start. He doesn't know his ""neighbors"". Although they politely receive him, they apparently weren't ever expecting a marriage proposal visit and don't know quite how to deal with one. Ondas's gift looks like an electric light fixture -with lots and lots of little pieces to keep clean- intended for an elegant room. It wouldn't be of any use in a yurt with dust (and a little smoke?) and no electricity. And he talks of giving a large number of sheep too, never mind that the sheep don't seem to be his to give, or that talking of a large number of sheep in the context of marriage seems irrelevant. The scenic views of far away horizons and sparse vegetation portray what I'd call a semi-desert. Just try to imagine a ""tulip"" sprouting up between those tufts. If you can imagine it at all, it will look horribly out of place. Likewise the tulip Asa draws into the scene on his collar is in a different style and colors than the rest.

I think she takes pride in her race and nationality. I don't know whether this story in nonfiction, but it is the truth that people who were proud of being the Jewish people such as the little girl were persecuted, so this film is short but I think it taught us the important thing we must nit forget. This film's title, ""Porcelain Unicorn"" fills the important role in this film. I think this beautiful porcelain unicorn show the Jewish people. The little girl treasured it. The German boy also cherished it, so I think he was not going to hurt the Jewish people.

This inevitably leads to his suspension from UCOS although it turns out this was his plan all along as he believes the officer he hit was culpable for a death in custody many years before and he plans to expose the truth at the enquiry. Soon after the rest of the team are called in when an ex-Argentine pistol is found; it is linked to two murders; one in England; the other, many years earlier, in Gibraltar.This proves an excuse for the team to head to The Rock to follow leads there. It won't be easy though as at the time of the murder Gibraltar was full of servicemen returning from victory in the Falklands and the weapon was almost certainly a souvenir brought back from the South Atlantic by a soldier. Their investigation will mean working with the local police and dealing with the military.

The resolution of the case was well handled; giving a rather poignant ending rather than a confrontation one might expect that confrontation was left for Brian's enquiry and is likely to leave viewers wanting to cheer as Brian has words with the man he hit!

The trailers looked promising, but all too often with these sorts of projects, the screen writers fail to truly understand and therefore connect with the source material, and even though this script/screenplay is not Cameron's best work, the shear power and dynamism of the original manga somehow pushes through as does the creator's love for it.

Flippen. Most of the actors were quite prolific and enjoyed long careers as character actors. Nielsen's career spanned over sixty years, and he lived long enough to re-invent himself in comic roles and start a new career.The story concerns honeymooners, the Partains (Nielsen and Colleen Miller), who are staying at a cabin near a small town. Bill Partain has been fired from his newspaper, and he gets wind of a big story that could win him his job back. A well-known thief, Tom Ellis (Robert Wilke), has struck again, and a bank employee was killed. He's hiding out nearby. No one in the town wants to help Partain find Ellis or his wife Ruth, who lives separately from him, because it's a poor town and Ellis has helped many of them for a long time. When Partain finally finds Ellis and interviews him, the actions of one of Ellis' psycho partners (Richards) make Partain a hostage.This isn't a bad B movie. As a B movie made in black and white, it does have a TV feel to it. Richards handles a showy role well. Colleen Miller, who plays Nielsen's wife, had a difficult role; the wife was sort of a pain. The attractive Miller retired a year later when she married Ted Briskin, a wealthy man previous married to Betty Hutton.Worth watching for the young Nielsen, and if you're my age, the actors will bring back memories for you.",274,0,,0,"No reference.

It may be confirmation bias, but I found myself voicing ""yes"", ""exactly"", and pointing at the screen as I recognized the experiences and emotions.While the film is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the breadth and depth of how many comedians took part, I kept waiting in anticipation to see several more; Bill Burr, Louis CK #metoo, Zach Galifanakis, Todd Barry, Paula Poundstone, Lilly Tomlin, Tig Nayarit, David Cross, etc.9/10",227,0,,0,"No reference.

Now, I didn't know anything about the movie. I just saw some good reviews and it looked like it will have a heavy dose of 80s Nostalgia+gave me Stranger Things vibes, so I gave it a shot.The story is nothing new. And the movie definitely has cliches that come with stories like these. But at the same time, the execution of the story and how it ends not only surprised me but also made me have a great time pretty much throughout. It reminded me a lot of movies like Disturbia, and also Stranger Things as I thought it would. It's a mix of elements from the two giving you a heavy dose of 80s Nostalgia which I appreciated a lot.The acting was great. The main four teens, in particular, did an awesome job. You could actually feel they are best buds and I liked seeing them work together. I also liked the moments between Nikki and Davey (the main couple you could say). They were sweet.I loved how the movie felt very grounded pretty much throughout. It's not something like The Babysitter where Juda Lewis (one of the main teens) performed in too, dude is great in both btw. It feels grounded because the story is simple and the movie doesn't try to make you suspend your disbelief all that much. Instead, the movie uses great cinematography and AWESOME music to elevate the scenes it has and it constantly keeps you interested by keeping you in a state of doubt for most of the movie. And on top of that still manages to surprise you in the final act.From the very first scene, I was in love with the soundtrack. The movie goes all in with Synthwave and it was just magnificent. And the movie utilizes it properly all the time. You see, the movie takes a lot of time setting up the story and creating tension. So much so that it's pretty much a slow burn in a way but one that is done right. Even small scenes or mundane stuff feels better when shot properly and accompanied by great music. And because of that, there was this constant vibe that, if like me, you love about these movies, you'll usually end up having a good time.The movie wasn't perfect, though. Some of the writing was weak, a plot point or two were just stupid. And I wish the final act didn't felt like it was somewhat rushed. I loved how the main story was resolved but it also felt like the movie ends a bit too quickly after that.All in all, this was a pleasant surprise. I wanted a good 80s nostalgia movie and this movie gave me just that plus more. It was fun, it was shocking and tense at times, and it was just plain entertaining.

Especially strange as this is the opening scene of new Showrunner John Nathan Turner's era and one would think he would want a more interesting, striking, exciting or funny opening. The opening we get is pretty dull and odd. After that we get a flawed adventure which never reaches top standard and has various aspects which are weak but overall I feel it is overly criticised. I think it is okay. It is quite entertaining, especially in the middle parts.The tone is far less zany and comedic than the Graham Williams produced era which had just ended and has a more serious feel along with efforts to be intellectual and use high scientific ideas. It is not all convincing and some of it seems a bit flaky but the ambition is admirable.Tom is better in this more reined in style in my opinion but the script often fails to let him shine. It is interesting and dramatic when he gets aged by a machine and that is the highlight for me.The plot is decent and the Argolins who run a leisure complex with hidden things going on are good in concept. They look a bit over the top but it works okay while the ideas of their race dying out etc work well. The Foamasi are cleverly used as unseen mysterious characters who seem menacing and intriguing until they appear fully at which point the costumes let it down.There is plenty of good acting from numerous cast members and the dialogue is mostly fine.

But rather in the marketing of clichés, comprising the desires and fears that inhabit the emotional landscape of the masses. They are consequently not very nice people, as their engines are fueled on cynicism and blind greed. And if there isn't a Russian communist, Muslim or impertinent bacillus to pillory—easy targets of hatred—they feel impelled to turn to other pop icons of loathing. In this case, lesbians. As presumed by this writer, the only women evil enough to reject acceptable norms of decency and basic human compassion are women who have no need of men. Especially ones who are this extraordinarily beautiful. These particular producers also perhaps hoped to cash in on the titillation that girl-on-girl action might arouse in the segment of straight men who buy into that erotic trope. That being said, these are all marvelous actors whom I admire profoundly. Their work here is excellent. Would that they had had the altruism to sniff out the rot at the core of this apple. In addition to the trite homophobia, this movie fails for two additional lapses in reason. Rooney Mara's character performs a grotesquely brutal act that would make a navy seal squeamish, let alone a Greenwich princess.

I had been following a bit of the hype and viral marketing that went along with the film and was excited about seeing it.I just saw the first screening here in NZ and again it was great. The way the movie is all shot with hand held was really cool and made the film really visceral and real. I know people were moaning a bit about the shaky camera, but I actually found myself questioning it in parts because it wasn't shaky enough. The whole thing really worked.I was a little skeptical about it being a J.J. Abrams production however, as he annoyed me with Lost and never answering questions and replacing them with new ones etc. But there was sufficient info given in the movie as to not feel like you were left severely hanging at the end. There are questions left unanswered which is understandable considering it is just these peoples video account.The monster was pretty cool and you get to see pretty much the entire thing throughout the film. It also carries some scary cargo which it drops all over the place that make for a tense subway run. All in all I was pretty satisfied with the monster, except for its apparent invulnerability.Because it was a movie it did have to have a bit of a story and it mostly revolves around the relationship between Rob and his long time friend, recently love interest, Beth. This part was what made me drop this to a 9 and not a 10. It was a little corny that this guy would risk his life and the lives of his friends to go back into the city where a giant monster is, to save his girlfriend who is almost certainly dead anyway. It didn't make a lot of sense and I don't think people can relate to it, I know I really couldn't. I did on many occasions just think ""why aren't they getting the hell out of the city?"" or ""what the hell is he thinking?!"". This was my feeling mainly when he decides to go inside Beth's apartment building which has collapsed onto another one, you'll see...However leaving the main story behind and focusing on the rest of the film it is an awesome ride and a very original monster film. It warrants another watch for the experience of being there all over again. I doubt a sequel will follow however it would be nice to have it wrapped up in a nice neat little package, but I imagine that will spoil the feel of the film.Although not for everyone (especially those with severe motion sickness), Cloverfield lives up to the hype and is a fabulous way to spend $15.

Straight Outta Compton attempts to tell their story from their roots in Compton to their eventual and inevitable break up.The members of NWA that the film follows are MC Ren, DJ Yella, Eazy- E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, but the story primarily focuses on the latter three and the disagreements that led to NWA's demise. Simultaneously, Straight Outta Compton examines the societal landscape and cultural turmoil happening at the time that led to the voices of NWA being heard and celebrated.The sheer volume of narrative that needs to be told in the film is gargantuan. Unfortunately for the screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff, they are not successful and the whole story feels like a Wikipedia version of NWA. A film of this size should reveal some additional unknown information or motivation, and it fails to do so. Further the constant contemplation upon the LA riots and that time period feels overly forced to reflect our current situation, a heavy handed and unnecessarily graceless approach.The other greatest criticism is its dollar store approach to the costume and hair design on the film. Perhaps it is because the 90's weren't that long ago that those alive recall the style and fashion, but it's pretty abominable in Straight Outta Compton. None of the actors look to be comfortable in their garbs and the limited diversity in outfits leads the audience to believe each character only had one costume each. The whole look of the time created in Straight Outta Compton is immediately off-putting and difficult to get past.The film isn't all bad, and the best decision the filmmakers made was to get Ice Cube's real son to portray Ice Cube in the film. Not only does O'Shea Jackson Jr. look startlingly similar to his father, but his performance is the only complex one. Rather than reverting to a constant scowl and mean mugging the camera, his performance is of a man across many years. O'Shea is the only actor able to rise above his poor costuming and inhabit the role completely, then again, he has had his whole life to observe his father.The story behind Straight Outta Compton was always going to be a difficult task, but to those aware of the NWA story, it could have been better. In the end, it feels like a highlight reel, glossing over the details to help audiences fully understand the inner- workings of its downfall and the complex happenings between Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. And for a film about a music group, more rap and hip-hop music from the time would have been greatly appreciated.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",466,0,,0,"No reference.

The songs in this film are wonderfully written and performed, including a very charming outdoor song and dance routine performed by O'Connor and the film's youngest actress, 9 year old Noreen Corcoran, who brightens the many scenes she's in, playing Judy's sister, Clarabelle, who seems to like to be involved in everything. (The songs have very clever lyrics as well!) Melvin seeks to win the hand of Judy, but her usual date, Harry Black (Richard Anderson), who's pretty much a square, is about to pop the question to the delight of Judy's dad, while her dad dislikes Melvin.

Almost all of the major characters in the movie operate in government or in the underworld, and they are all corrupt, or at least somewhat so: look around you and you'll find that to be a reflection of today's reality. Also, there's little-to-no exposition: characterization and plot complication are the keys to understanding what's going on in this film, and I find that challenging and interesting, because it again reflects the reality of how one discerns meaning in real life. The twisty plot unfolds only as we learn who's who, and why they do what they do. The resolution is one of the most neatly drawn I've ever seen: all the disparate subplots come coherently together (a la Shakespeare!). This is a thinking person's movie, definitely not for the jejune who need to have characters tell them what's happening in a movie through usually extraneous dialog.

To say that this goes against all the build up from the last 7 seasons is like saying you knew what was going to happen. You didn't. Know one other than the showrunners and G.R.R.M knew and they made this ending based on advice FROM G.R.R.M.
People saying this was not Game of Thrones obviously have missed the point. Since series 1 these charachters have been fighting unbeatable odds and the top 10 charachters (for screen time) have all survived, John - granted he died but was obviously redirected - Tyrion, Danny, Sansa, Cersei, Arya, Jaime, Sam, Jorah and Theon; UNTIL NOW.
Jorah and Theon, two of the longest running, and in the top ten for screen time have been wiped off. They're the two largest deaths of major characters since Petyr B and good ol' Ned Stark. All other charachters have LESS screen time, meaning this episode technically has the highest death count of major charachters when based on their respective screen time.
Yes, it's rediculous that our fan favourites all survived against hordes of unead but never in an episode have I felt such fear and tension for the lives of these charachters; such a build up of they're all going to destination-F that it's actually shocking they mostly survived! The shock here is they all survived in a perilous, last-second win or they all die situation which is the staple of films like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and the MCU.

765,406693,2002-03-19,badmaash9911,Bamboozled (2000),,"Bamboozled is a movie that addresses the issue of racism concerning African Americans.  From the very beginning, the raw reality of it is thrown into the faces of the audience, and they are left to deal with it on their own.  The story is centered on an aspiring writer for a major television company, who happens to be black.  Lately, the public has not been very receptive to his work.  The main reason being that the work didn't `appeal' to the African American population.  Played by Damon Wayans, Pierre, the writer, is accused of not being in touch with the black community, and this is why his work failed.  An issue of self-identity and place in society then arises.  What does it mean to be black?  Does it mean that one has to conform themselves to fit the mold of the stereotypes set forth by society? This is what Pierre hopes to abolish.  By creating a show that is the very embodiment of all black stereotypes, he hopes that the people will see the hideous prejudice, and realize their wrong.  What follow is the exact opposite.  Instead of offending and angering the majority of the public, they end up loving it.  As the plot develops, Spike Lee shows how the issue of race and ignorance affects each character and how it changes them personally.  By bringing the audience to the receiving end of racism, they are up close and personal to what it really feels to be a victim of bigotry.  Bamboozled leaves the audience bewildered, and shocked.  The intensity of this ground-shaking movie forces one to reevaluate their perceptions of themselves, and the society that they live in.",279,0,,0,"No reference.

I like this new version because it goes along well with the book. I like how each individual kid goes through a scary experience, and meets Pennywise individually. The story was really good and I liked how it started with Georgie going missing, it made things that more tense. The story follows the losers club and their personal experiences with ""It"" and bullies. They band together to create the losers club and form a friendship that is very close. I like how in this version they focus more on Bill, Beverly, and Ben's relationship and how their early childhood love blooms. I felt they went more in depth in this version then in the previous version explaining a lot more. What I really liked is the ending though, the ending was really great. When they all team up on Pennywise and beat the living hell out of him. Then they all make a promise in blood to return to Derry if ""It"" returns which is a major bonus that shows there will be a second part. The only downside is I was hoping they would show a cut scene at the end of the credits, but all we got is Pennywise's evil laugh. Another thing that confirms a second part is that it says part 1 at the end.This new ""It"" was a good remake. And I'm glad I went and enjoyed it the theater was packed so I knew somehow it was popular. And it was funny how people in the room jumped and screamed, I did a few times. This woman next to me literally grabbed me a few times when she got scared. I didn't mind it,and she apologized to me afterwards and I was cool with it. Her girlfriends thought it was funny. I thought it was cool. ""It"" is a good horror movie and it was better then the previous one. I still like the old one though.

After all, so many shows and films are marketed towards guys and it seems more than reasonable that one should be marketed more towards women. However, in the case of ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"", I really do think the show would appeal more to ladies--though guys will also enjoy the show and should not avoid it. Why do I say this? Well, since my oldest daughter first saw the show, she's gotten EVERYONE to watch it--and my house has been filled with women who simply love the show! I hear lots of comments about Miss Fisher's wonderful clothes, the budding romances between the various characters and how nice it is to see a strong female lead who does NOT need a guy to rush in and save her. Heck, often in the shows it's Miss Fisher who saves guys and shoots the baddies! This I can really appreciate, as I have two daughters and don't want either to buy into the old fashioned notion that women are weak. Miss Fisher is anything but weak!

As for the show itself, it's a very well written and engaging murder mystery show. What I particularly like about the show is that the cases are not simple (too often in mystery films, this IS the case) and the production values are amazing. It really does look like the 1920s in the show and it does a great job in trying to get the decade correct. My only reservation is that perhaps this is not a great show for kids or even teens, as Miss Fisher has a very strong sexual appetite---and I am not sure this is the best message for kids to emulate. Sex is great...indiscriminate sex can be deadly. Still, given it's a show about murders, it isn't exactly marketed to younger audiences and parents should use common sense here.

With the exception of a few slower scenes, I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. A few laughs, intense thought and emotion, and a few tears were generated from this well directed and acted film.

The filming techniques and styles, and the soundtrack selections helped me score this film. The direction and unique filming combined with some classical scores and the storyline all fit perfectly together.

The story itself follows the plight of Loic, a young handsome 20-year old who works in a chocolate factory by day, and entertains men of all ages by night for extra cash. In the film, he has a close loving friendship with a girl, Marie. He also develops a relationship of trust with a man he meets on the Internet, Lionel. The 2 never have sexual relations, just conversation about life. Something interesting to note: we never see Lionel. Or do we at the end? You decide.

The story line develops around Loic's desires to be someone - a photographer, a gay man, ...? He seems to have lost direction in life, and is unable to trust/confide in the 2 people who seem to care for him most, Marie and Lionel. When Marie finds a boyfriend, you can clearly see the upset and anger in Loic. He withdraws from Marie, and Lionel, and neither situation has a positive outcome.

In the meantime, he develops an infatuation of sorts with a local soccer player, who is successful, married and with child. Loic sees a life he wants for himself.

Although this is a French film (with English subtitles), we have young people like Loic all over America. And we have adults who take advantage of them - and we have adults, like Lionel in this film, who truly can be a trusted friend. One of my favorite lines spoken by Lionel to Loic is ""You can be interested in someone without wanting to f**k them"". This statement rings true for so many, both those near the age of 20, and those near the age of 40.

In 1963 any sexual overtones would be unthinkable, and we would never worry that he might be a threat to her, nor do the people looking for them. About the story's spy and his dirty work? Once again, the skewed neutral-relativist politics of the series plays a hand. The spy is recalled as once spying for the British, but now he's working for the ""other side"". (In ""Espionage"", any mention of Russia, East Germany or Communism is avoided, even at the cost of story integrity.) The point being, of course, if the Brits have used him as a spy, they have no claim on moral superiority over when the, um, ""other side"" does the same thing. See, it's all equal. Nobody's right, maybe both are wrong. Tsk Tsk. That ""The other side"" wants to enslave the Earth one country at a time is not important enough to consider.",285,0,,0,"No reference.

779,3328120,2017-06-27,Vartiainen,Alien: Covenant (2017),6.0,"Ridley Scott once again returns to the Alien franchise, this time focusing on the events after the film Prometheus. Some years have passed and once again a spaceship full of ignorant travellers land on a planet where they really shouldn't.These prequel films have gathered their fair amount of hate from the fans of the original films. And I can understand why. They change things. Ridley Scott of course always had some idea about where the xenomorphs came from or what they really were, but it was never talked about in the originals. Because it wasn't necessary. And there was an elegance to that, which is lost in these prequels as things and mythos get thicker and thicker.And yet I do admire these newer films for undertaking the task of trying to explain, and explain in a way that would make sense, not just logically but also emotionally. And they do succeed. Granted, it's not perfect, and Prometheus especially had some pretty weird and jarring things in it, but this film largely makes up for that. After seeing it, I can see the path from Prometheus to Alien. And it makes sense, is properly horrific as is fitting for this horror franchise, and genuinely works as an overall story.That being said, it stumbles around as a movie. The first third is actually really good. The new characters are interesting, the new planet looks amazing, the horror is there, the anticipation, the tension and when the violence finally comes, it's genuinely thrilling and gory. The second third starts to go downhill. I have nothing against Michael Fassbender in these films, but as we focus on him so much, it almost seems like the xenomorphs become superfluous. And in a way they do, and that's a problem. It simply doesn't feel right when a xenomorph is a B-plot in an Alien film.The final third is much the same as the second, but the final ending is something that I have to admire. Because it's not a typical Hollywood ending. Not even a typical Alien ending in a way. And kudos for that, Ridley Scott.Alien: Covenant doesn't come close to matching the brilliance of Alien and Aliens. But it just might be the third best film in the franchise anyway. It has the vision as well as the ambition, plus beautiful visuals, good action and the best horror moments since those two. A mixed package, but ultimately worth a watch.",406,0,,0,"No reference.

784,2583348,2013-12-29,zardoz-13,47 Ronin (2013),5.0,"Ethnocentrism occurs when one culture appropriates something from another culture and then attempts to enhance it. The latest version of the legendary Genroku Akō incident, the tragic 18th century Japanese account of samurai warriors avenging their fallen leader, displays all the vestiges of ethnocentrism. Mind you, the Japanese produced six previous cinematic adaptations about their historic milestone before Hollywood tampered with it. For the record, those movies were ""The 47 Ronin"" (1941), ""Chûshingura"" (1958), ""Chushingura"" (1962), ""The Fall of Ako Castle"" (1978), ""47 Ronin"" (1994) and ""The Last Chushingura (2010). Presumably, Hollywood must have felt that this constituted an ideal opportunity to produce its own spin on this venerable story. Not surprisingly, Universal Studios has taken considerable liberties with the material. Not only has the studio embroidered this renowned tale of honor with outlandish supernatural elements, specifically demons and witchcraft, but it also has added a half-breed European supporting character to the yarn. Presumably, Universal must have felt that attracting an American audience to a $200-million plus film primarily about the Japanese would only recoup its costs if a major American actor got mixed up in it. Keanu Reeves of ""The Matrix"" trilogy appears as the improbable white guy who sets the catastrophic events of the Akō vendetta into motion as well as dictates how the Japanese can resolve their dreadful predicament. Freshman director Carl Rinsch and ""Wanted"" scenarist Chris Morgan with ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" scribe Hossein Amini have fashioned a conventional chronicle of samurai versus samurai, with a grim finale that precludes any thought of a sequel. If you know nothing about the outrageous revisions that the filmmakers have imposed on the most celebrated instance of the samurai code of honor, you will probably enjoy this scenic saga about sword and sorcery a lot more. Imagine what any important event in American history would emerge as if a Japanese individual interfered with it and you'll have a good idea about ""47 Ronin."" ""47 Ronin"" takes place in feudal Japan in the 1700s. Lord Asano (Min Tanaka of ""Black Dawn"") of the Ako province adopts a wandering teenager, Kai (Keanu Reeves), who is the son of a British sailor and a Japanese peasant. The boy's mother abandoned him, and demons raised him. Eventually Kai ran away from them and Lord Asano took him in as one of his own. Kai grew up with Asano's daughter, Mika (Kô Shibasaki of ""One Missed Call""), and the two become romantically attracted to each other. Meanwhile, since Kai is a half-breed, he cannot serve Lord Asano as a samurai. Instead, he functions as the equivalent of a scout. The first major scene shows him slaying a massive beast that resembles an enormous buffalo with tree branches for antlers. Naturally, another samurai warrior, Yasuno (Masayoshi Haneda of ""Emperor""), claims credit for the kill, but Asano's number one samurai, Ôishi (Hiroyuki Sanada of ""The Wolverine""), knows the truth. Later, Lord Asano welcomes his supreme leader, Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa of ""Mortal Combat""), to his palatial estate along with his chief rival, Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano of ""Thor: The Dark World""), from the nearby Nagato province. The villainous Kira conspires with the aid of a demonic, shape-shifting witch, (Rinko Kikuchi of ""Pacific Rim""), to drug Asano into attacking him. The witch uses a bulbous spider to deliver a drug across Asano's lips while he is asleep so that he awakens and imagines that Kira is raping his daughter. Appalled by his own behavior, Asano follows the dictates of the Shogun in committing ritual suicide. Ôishi blames himself for letting these events transpire, especially after Kai warned him about the witch. Everybody but Asano and his daughter treats Kai with utter contempt. After Asano slashes his belly open with a knife, Ôishi completes the ordeal by decapitating his master. The heartless Shogun banishes all Asano's samurai who are now designated as ronin. At the same time, Kira sells Kai into slavery where Kai becomes a highly prized combatant in arena showdowns. The Shogun commands Mika to marry Kira after mourning the death of her father for a year. Kira has Ôishi thrown into a dungeon where he spends the next year. Eventually, after he is released, the vengeance driven Ôishi assembles the remaining samurai and persuades Kai to join them as they set out to deal with the murderous Kira.Compared with other samurai sages, ""47 Ronin"" is fairly routine stuff. The battle sequences lack grandeur, and the sword play is pretty dull. The massive ritual suicide at the end isn't exactly what American audiences will enjoy. Imagine ""Star Wars"" ending with everybody eviscerating themselves at fade-out and you have a good idea what to expect. This big-budgeted spectacle also suffers from second-rate special effects. Most of the sprawling mountain backdrops are clearly computer-generated, while the swirling witch's dragon looks like something out of a Chinatown carnival. Presumably, Rinsch and his writers decided to rely on sorcery because nobody knows for certain why Asano attacked his guest in real-life. The way that Asano is poisoned is reminiscent of how the Japanese girl died at the hands of Ninjas in the James Bond movie ""You Only Live Twice."" In ""You Only Live Twice,"" a ninja hid in the rafters, dangled a thread above the heroine's mouth, and dribbled poison down it. The witch in ""47 Ronin"" behaves less spectacularly than the witch in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" that co-scripter Hossein Amini penned. The art direction, production design, and cinematography make ""47 Ronin"" look more impressive than its ersatz plot. Interestingly enough, this film didn't impress Japanese audiences, and Universal has already written it off as a financial disaster. Ultimately, ""47 Ronin"" qualifies as a tolerable movie with guts but little gusto.",954,0,,1,"Reference to other reviews.  **Reason:** The text frequently makes comparisons to other movies (""Star Wars"", ""You Only Live Twice"", ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") and references how the film was received by audiences and Universal Studios (""this film didn't impress Japanese audiences, and Universal has already written it off as a financial disaster"").

788,3259835,2017-03-20,jasonmilburn-28140,Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),8.0,"I'll start by mentioning that I adore the original animation, rating it as my #1 Disney film. When I heard this was coming out, I was extremely excited. I had no idea what to expect and avoided the trailers because I wanted to keep an open mind - something that turned out to be very necessary!First I'll start with a few weaker points.The absolute killer for me was the general feel. It was nowhere near as vibrant as it should have been and I didn't feel enough contrast between the first and second halves. When I found out that the director of some Twilight films was involved, everything became very clear. At some points it just felt so grey and not very Disney-like and I truly think that poor direction held this production back. Especially some of the happier scenes in the castle - I was sitting thinking 'Jesus, isn't the saturation a little bit off'. I know it's supposed to be gloomy, but isn't the whole film really about finding beauty in unlikely places? That being said, the scene where Belle is racing through the gardens after being released was stunning.Secondly the portrayal of a gay man for comic relief was distasteful and a little insulting. Props to Disney for having the guts to include this, however I can't help feeling that it was more for publicity than anything else. The whole thing with that musketeer being dressed as a woman was completely stupid and shortsighted; the same ridiculous clichè that the community tries so hard to cast off. If you're going to include a gay character, make it a full part of a story and not just comic relief or a fleeting scene obviously added to tick boxes. It was all quite irrelevant to be honest.Lastly with the negatives - I didn't completely love the effects. I thought the cartoony feel was charming and not something I expected. Personally I felt this worked well - although the town felt more charming than anything else and I felt myself asking Belle, 'is it really that awful?'. On the other hand, it somewhat seemed a half-done job; halfway between an animation and live-play. The enchanted objects in the castle had really strange faces that didn't convey the comforting characters they're supposed to be but their bodies (for lack of a better word) were rather well animated. The Beast was a bit strange to look at too and felt half-baked. There was without a doubt, room for improvement there. The castle, however; was breathtaking and did the animated version the justice it deserved.An area which I'm quite undecided on is Emma Watson as Belle. I adore her as an actress; I think she has some real talent but I can't work out whether she was right for the role. On one side she conveys the small-town girl role who wants adventure very well. Her inquisitive side is very believable and it's very clear she doesn't fit in. On the other side i don't really think she has the warmth of the original Belle; it was as if she cared more about rebelling and staying in the castle than about her feelings for the Beast. This is NOT a criticism of her acting at all - what she did, she did well despite the poor direction. I just believe there could have been a better fit.Acting-wise the standout roles were probably Gaston and Lumiere's voice acting. They really carried the film in my opinion; Gaston was definitely more comedic than the original but this was a welcome addition. Lumiere was the perfect host and despite the questionable animation, was still the same charming character as before. I don't think any of the acting was particularly weak - still room for more believability but I blame the silly choice of directors - why choose the director of a cheap, wooden, gloomy series about vampires and werewolves for a vibrant Disney epic?The film stays true to its roots and whilst it doesn't add much, what it did add worked really well. For example the book which took Belle back to Paris was something that really built upon her character, even if it was a little bit far-fetched. It answered some questions which were left unanswered before. Something I really missed was the Beast's roar as Belle ran from the castle after letting her free. It's small, I know, but was incredibly powerful in the original. They could have saved themselves the effort of writing that extra song and portrayed the same pain.Overall a good adaptation which somehow kept the charm of the original despite being held-back by poor choice of directors. Lots of room for improvement but certainly not a waste of time or money. Please also ignore these family-friendly negative comments. The 'gay' scene (it feels like a total joke even calling it this) lasted for probably not even a second and should have been cut anyway as it was totally pointless. Like I said, if you're going to include inclusive relationships, don't force it into a classic and do it properly!

This, however, is the first time I intentionally watched a re-run. There really was nothing else on TV and I had nothing else to so. Besides, there is some sense of achievement and also pleasure in thrashing a Baywatch episode, even if it is like shooting fish in a barrel.Prologue: Someone packs and ships a doll from Hong Kong to Malibu. It'll probably have some relevance later. Oh, what a teaser, how *will* I survive until the doll's importance is revealed? Then, Matt saves a girl, Nancy, from drowning. She's a waitress who's having an audition to become an actress. But oh no, she lost her money in the water! So the gullible Matt lends her $100 because he ""can recognize a talent"". Summer no like this.Meanwhile, the world's most blind tractor driver in the world is smoothing the sand on the beach or something, and Mitch is the only person who can see that he's about to run over a man. Naturally, Mitch *just* manages to save him in the last second. Cliché alert! But it gets ""better"": the man, Henry, says he's looking for his daughter because he's dying. And the daughter in his photo just happens to be the girl Matt saved. Except that Henry claims her name is Rachel.At this point the show went into a commercial break, so I have time to state that I came to like A.J. Langer in Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs, which is, given the current boom at the time of writing, due for a remake like all horror movies of the 1980s. Anyway, it is a shame she never quite made it in the harsh market that is Hollywood.Now back to the episode. I was already wondering where the stupid montages were when we were subjected to a sugar-coated montage of Stephanie and what's-his-name having a nice time. Bleurgh! Matt doesn't hear from the girl (or the money - Summer no like that either!), but Mitch introduces the girl's father to him. So, the girl is after a yacht coming from Hong Kong and his father goes on the look after her. But, in an amazing coincidence, Matt runs into her! The girl bolts, but Matt catches her. She tells her she missed the audition and also got fired from her job and Matt buys this hook, line and sinker. How stupid is that guy? When Matt tells about Nancy's father, the girl tells that he is a maniac who beats her. *This* Matt for some reason doesn't buy. It's like if he's flipping a coin when making decisions. Again, the girl promises to bring Matt her money the following day and he buys it.And, as if we weren't nauseated enough by the first montage, we then have a montage of people playing American football on the beach. This has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the episode. Which does not surprise anyone.Stephanie confronts Mitch with the subject of whether there are any feelings between them. When Mitch only wants to be her friend, she decides to take Scott's-his-name seriously.Nancy comes to ask Matt for help to get the package that came on the yacht from Hong Kong. Matt agrees on the condition that after they have fetched the package, Nancy will meet her father.Speaking about Nancy's father, he just coincidentally happens to arrive at Mitch's tower just as Summer tells Mitch where she saw Nancy. Another nice coincidence! The man then intrudes on Matt's boat and puts him and Nancy, now called Linda, at gunpoint. Linda calls the man Sam. They are con artists! What a shocker! Let's go to a commercial! I'll stop with the plot descriptions now as enough material has already been described and I can assure you it does not get any better in the last act. As any Baywatch viewer knows, the acting is flat, the dialog is grating, the cinematography uninspired and the direction barely adequate. I can recommend this episode only if you liked A.J. Langer, but it will still destroy some of your brain cells. Which, now that I think about it, was probably the intent of the makers of Baywatch from the start - after the novelty of gratuitous slow-motion montages wore of, most of the core audience had lost enough braincells to become mindless zombies watching Baywatch purely on instinctual basis.Montages in this episode: two (2).

798,1145802,2006-03-04,eht5y,The Cooler (2003),9.0,"The Cooler' sort of flew under the radar in its initial run. It deserves a much wider audience than it received in theatrical release. Writer/director Wayne Kramer has achieved something remarkable here--a love story within a love story: an unlikely romance between a professional loser and an aging cocktail waitress cast against an almost reverent paean to the old Las Vegas, when Frank, Deano, and Sammy reigned supreme and there wasn't a pirate ship or roller coaster to be found. Kramer also brings out some amazing performances, especially by Alec Baldwin as Shelly Kaplow, arguably his finest performance ever, and easily his best since 'Glengarry Glen Ross' or 'Malice.' The plot itself hinges on an old, all but forgotten Vegas tradition: William H. Macy is Bernie, a professional 'cooler'--a guy whose luck is so bad it's contagious, and who is paid to sidle up to any table where a gambler is on a run of luck and cool the action with his mere presence. The film's opening scene has an almost surreal quality, as hang-dog Bernie paces the floor, magically passing his bad luck with nothing more than a subtle touch of green felt or brass.Bernie works at the Golden Shangri-La, a bastion of Vegas traditionalism managed by Shelley Kaplow (Alec Baldwin), who runs his casino with religious fidelity to the old ways, idealizing the Rat Pack-era Vegas, the days before Sin City became, in Shelley's words, a ""Disneyland mookfest."" But Shelley is under pressure: longtime club headliner Buddy Stafford (Paul Sorvino) is way past his prime and carries a dark secret. The casino's investors have grown reluctant to hold on to the old ways at the expense of the record-breaking revenues being brought in by the newer, flashier, family-friendly casinos, and Shelley finds himself in a power struggle with Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston), a Harvard-educated wunderkind brought in to revitalize the struggling Shangri-La. Last but not least of Shelley's troubles is that Bernie the Cooler has announced his intention to leave town. Shelley has owned Bernie for years (Bernie's crippled shuffle is a souvenir from his days of gambling addiction administered by Shelley for non-payment of a massive debt), but Bernie is now in the clear and wants to put Vegas behind him.But Bernie finds himself reconsidering after he falls into bed with Natalie (Maria Bello), a failed showgirl-turned-cocktail waitress who propositions Bernie after he notices her being groped by a gambler on a hot streak and promptly cools the offending customer's luck. Unfortunately, Bernie's first dose of good luck in ages comes with a particular liability: having unexpectedly found happiness, Bernie finds his talent for passing on bad luck has reversed itself--to the chagrin of Shelley Kaplow.William H. Macy has long been respected has a character actor, and it's a treat to see him bring his talents to a rare lead role for a middle-aged actor of average appearance. His Bernie is truly pathetic, and yet his charm and growing confidence make his affair with Natalie believable and inspiring. Bernie is a loser, but he has courage and character, especially when confronted with his failure as a father when his dead-beat hustler son (Shawn Hatosy) appears with a pregnant, coke-snorting girlfriend (Estella Warren) in tow. Maria Bello gives an astonishing, award-worthy performance as Natalie. It's just a mystery to me that she is not a major star. She is stunningly beautiful but also persuasively real, and her moments of honesty and vulnerability in this film stick with you. Natalie is not without considerable flaws, but her love for Bernie is absolutely believable, and I found myself feeling deeply invested in them.Much of the small buzz around this film was generated by Macy and Bello's sex scenes, which are genuinely remarkable--visceral and explicit without seeming the least bit pornographic or gratuitous. This is attributable to the investment of the actors in their characters and their craft. The ardor feels totally genuine. Bello and Macy look not like actors playing roles, but like two people in love, going at it like they're never going to get another chance.But inasmuch as Bernie and Natalie are the clear hero and heroine, in certain respects, the film belongs to Alec Baldwin's Shelley. Baldwin hasn't had such a plum role in ages: Shelley is both a malicious sociopath and a tender, affectionate father figure. His loyalty to the old-school ways and his refusal to accept that Sinatra's Vegas is gone forever is genuinely tragic. Baldwin owns some of the film's finest moments: a rip-roaring tirade against the crassly commercialized Vegas embodied by his younger rival; a surprisingly tender moment with the aging crooner Buddy Stafford, where Shelley appears in Buddy's dressing room and tries to stroke the singer's flagging ego by presenting him a pair of panties he claims to have found hanging on the door-handle outside, only to have the harrowingly tragic Buddy point out that he knows Shelley bought the panties in the casino's lingerie shop, along with the services of the 'groupie' who'll be arriving shortly after Shelley leaves; a drunken catharsis after a confrontation with Bernie over Natalie that ends with Shelley smashing the architectural model of the new Shangri-La Larry plans to build, complete with shopping mall, food court, and roller-coasters.Perhaps the strongest statement of the film comes as the credits roll: a montage of video featuring the demolition of four legendary old-school casinos--the Aladdin, the Landmark, the Dunes, and the Sands, which, of course, was the Vegas home of Sinatra and the Rat Pack. It's a haunting lament at the end of a surprisingly fine film.",928,0,,0,"No reference.  This review is a detailed description of the movie, its plot, characters, and themes.

Silly pretext for Godzilla in the first place. The Nuclear reactor setting at the start of the book pointless and lacks any sort of real emotion. The Japanese/US link never really explained as to why the US army is managing the Godzilla 'eggs'. So many plot holes it's unreal. I think what sinks the film is really a lack of direction.

Fortunately, the fourth episode digs a little deeper into her psychology, and permits Heigl to build the foundations of one of the show's most rounded, compelling performances (as the Emmy for her work in Season Three confirms).Right at the start, she is shown in a more three-dimensional light than usual, as she playfully embarrasses George by using the bathroom while he is in the shower. This adds to his frustration and makes him exclaim: ""I'm not your sister!"", although the real irritation will come at work: Izzie's last modeling job is published, prompting Alex to make her the laughing stock of the entire hospital. In addition, a patient recognizes her from a magazine photo and consequently refuses to be treated by her. As for the other more interesting intern, Cristina experiences a bad day of her own when she is forced to take care of a former nurse instead of helping Dr. Shepherd remove a set of nails from a guy's head (yep, you read correctly: nails in the head).That Cristina is the most fully rounded of the characters was obvious from the pilot episode (however, George and Derek are more fun to watch), while everyone else starts developing a realistic personality as the seasons pass. The briefest and most successful evolution is Izzie's, a transformation that reaches its peak when she tells off her judgmental patient and argues to perfection that a few shots of her in sexy lingerie do not necessarily reduce her medical skills. The anger and true humanity shown by Heigl in that scene are astounding, even touching, to the point that she gets away with another tough scene (the now infamous locker-room strip) without once looking ridiculous.With such gifted supporting players, the series can justify the overall daftness of its protagonist. This concession doesn't apply to other shows, though: can you imagine The Sopranos with Tony being the least compelling character?",368,0,,0,"No reference.

This show really makes sense if you know black culture. Even if you don't know black culture, it's STILL HILARIOUS! Family guy is great, but it doesn't make me laugh as hard as Cleveland show or Roger from American dad. Roger smith is the funniest Seth Macfarlane animation. Family guy is the best overall Seth macfarlane show, but Cleveland Show is THE FUNNIEST MACFARLANE SHOW! By far! Some say the red neck is dumb! DUH! He's dumb! Some fool said The show is offensive?!

To all the weak minded, uptight fools bashing this show, watch the re runs on adult swim or internet and realize how wrong you are. And stop being so uptight and learn to laugh. I suppose many haters of this show laugh very hard at Stale stuff like The office and arrested development, but they get confused by REAL comedy!

I also think the photography - scenes when the four characters are having dinner together - is great. They really create the illusion of four separate people talking and bickering.

There are moments when he's dancing and it's as if he can do all of this in his sleep.I was completely fascinated by him and earned a greater respect for him as an artist and as a person.This movie was very tastefully done by Kenny Ortega.

818,1526858,2007-10-17,kenvandenbussche-2,Rush Hour 3 (2007),7.0,"When Chris Tucker at the end of the second movie in one of the added bloopers says that one of the characters, which had just been thrown out of a window, wouldn't make it into ""Rush hour 3"" - this joke was both unexpected and very funny. Because at that time, nobody was already thinking of a second sequel. This should account for the duration of 6 long years between the second and third movie.Because every now and then, there are small hints that this funny series is running on empty. As mentioned above: it took a long time to greenlight this movie and come up with enough material to make it worth the while. Chris Tucker has grown fatter but fortunately for everyone involved he is still hysterical. This third movie still has many jokes to tell but not all of them work out as well as they should. On the other hand: there is Jackie Chan who is still incredibly agile and lightning fast doing the craziest moves imaginable. He actually manages to hide himself entirely into a flag on a pole from the bad guys in this movie. Sometimes it feels as though there are long pauses in between two action sequences, but once the action kicks off - it is always very entertaining to watch!In order to keep this movie from becoming a drag, they altered the setting once more. This time the duo find themselves in Paris, investigating one of the biggest crime syndicates in the world. This once again leads to fairly new and pleasant situations; each one funnier than the next. One of those new ideas is to mould a French taxi driver into the story and this particular character has its moments ... even though, at times, he seems more like a blunt copy of the main character in the 1998-French action movie ""Taxi"". Still: he is never really any boring and that's a good thing.Thus, Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan do what they do best and we love them for that! As always: the cast is very colorful. Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada plays the part of Kenji. Swedish actor Max von Sydow, best known for his role as the priest in the classic horror movie ""The exorcist"", stars as Varden Reynard. There's also a Japanese actress by the name of Youki Kudoh playing the mysterious figure of the Dragon Lady. Of course: there's a French woman involved as well. Noémie Lenoir plays the role of Genevieve. A famous Chinese actress named Jingchu Zhang does the role of Soo Yung; the little girl featured in the first film too. And compelling actor Tzi Ma returns as ambassador Han. On a more comical side note: be sure to watch out for Polish director Roman Polanski (famous for such classics as ""Chinatown"" and ""The pianist"") who takes place in front of the camera rather than behind it. He stars as French detective Revi. Truth be told: I hadn't even recognized him until after the movie.In short: ""Rush hour 3"" is a very entertaining movie but I think the series should end here. There is obviously no more room for another instalment without hitting rock bottom.",531,0,,0,"No reference.

822,3388839,2017-09-14,martax9,9½ Weeks (1986),5.0,"Kim Basinger portrays an ordinary woman with an ordinary job whose life is so boring she's ready to be swept off her feet by an attractive rich man. Right from the start he comes off as very sure of himself, playing the macho man who knows he can have any woman, places his arms around her, holds her hand and they haven't known each other for an hour. The film is so smooth though someone may miss the signs. We see them having fun, we see him playing tricks on her, buying her expensive gifts, playing with her like a little child, chasing after some children all smiles and joy. We also see them having fun in the bedroom where he always takes the lead. But at moments, there are scenes in which we see him get mad at her when she doesn't follow his orders like she always did and throw or hit things. He doesn't stop even when she's crying and afraid of him. He only tries to wipe the incidents out of her memory by kissing her and having sex with her. No apology, no talk over the matter, no self-examination in order to become a better man.That is because he simply does not care about what she wants. This is a game to him. He finds vulnerable women looking for a thrill, he manipulates them with his charming ways, gifts and money and then he asks them to do things they perhaps would have never done if it were not for him. When they do not comply, he loses control and shows his bad side. It is easy for someone to fall for his good looks, soft voice and great sense of style and the film does exactly that: it puts you in Kim Basinger's shoes. You fall in love with John (Mickey Rourke) like she did, so you do understand why she hasn't left yet or why it took her so long to leave him but you also feel the heartache she experiences when he doesn't show up like she asked him to -do something for her for a change. It is easy to judge her character in this film or any real woman over their decision not to leave a toxic or abusive person, but the truth is, every human being doesn't want to believe their partner does not love them. We try to find excuses to justify their mistakes, we hope they will change over time, we tell ourselves the good times are more than the bad ones and we've become so emotionally attached we can't just throw it all away for a couple of flaws.

Unlike Ultraman, Ultraseven can make himself, giant, normal, or miniature in size. And he had a very cool weapon, a very sharp ""boomerang-blade"" on top of his helmet.And the stories were very nice written for a show mostly done for kids (writters: do not under estimate kids) and ""Gozilla"" fans. Some of the shows were very impressive for me,I had to turned off the TV when he made himself miniature and entered in the nose and lungs of a girl to save her life, well I was a kid. The show was filled with good drama, acting, lot of monsters, space gadgets, and cool monster-kicking action. I think they made a remake of Ultra Seven in the late 70's but I'm no sure, I just say it because the second time I saw the show,the stories where the same but it looked different than I remembered (maybe it just the memory of a 6 year old to blame), it does not matter any way.I think Ultra Seven and Ultraman inspired the Power-Ranger series (not my favorite show), but if you like them do not miss the originals, they are fun to watch.",242,0,,0,"No reference.

825,4461198,2019-10-13,ElMaruecan82,大西洋城 (1980),9.0,"An old Victorian building where croupiers use to throne and has-been stars to perform is majestically standing above the boardwalk, before being reduced to ruins. This is Atlantic City at the turn of the 80s, a poor man's Vegas for some, a forgotten Mecca for gangsters during the Prohibition, a town past its glorious days and whose inhabitants, for the most of them, can find contentment in cherishing that very past because they simply have nowhere else to go, nothing else to dream of.There are two central protagonists in Louis Malle's ""Atlantic City"", three decades separate them and with that difference two totally different views of life. Sally (Susan Sarandon) is in her mid-thirties and dreams of being the first female croupier in Monte-Carlo, she's learning the ropes of the job while working as a seafood waitress, Atlantic City is a mean to an end and never would she consider spending her life in that ghost of a town. And Lou (Burt Lancaster) is a man in his late sixties, one we learn used to be a big shot in the old days, frequenting such illustrious names as Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel, a man past his prime who can only mourn his youthful days.Things aren't as schematic as they seem, Sally is obviously looking forward to a better future but Lou isn't much turned toward the past from my reading of the opening sequence. The scene is so sensually and smoothly handled that there's more than sheer voyeurism in it, Lou watches with stunned yes the beautiful Sally opening her shirt, cutting lemons and cleaning her arms with each halves, it looks like some ritual but the explanation is rather trivial, she's only getting rid of the clam smell. But it doesn't matter, it's all in the expression in Lou's face, something is fascinating him in this woman and somewhat his gazing is indirectly turned to the present she represents.Lou, as it happens, is in a relationship with Grace (Kate Reid), an old bed-ridden woman who came to the city in the 40s for a Betty Grable lookalike contest, and got stuck there. It's very telling when even the star that changed your life is rather unknown at the time being, and looking at the furniture of Kate's apartment, all full of picturesque bibelots, she's a woman who's rooted in the to the point of becoming its own past relics, broken down ornamental, but still there. Lou and Kate form a rather unconventional couple, she berates him, belittles his manhood and yet both seem to need each other for a reason: they each represent the other's past, they're their own existential landmark.Lou and Kate are neighbors to Sally and all live in a building waiting for demolition, they're all in suspended sentences fully aware of the collapse of their living, only Sally nurture hopes while Kate is resigned and Lou seems to desperately hang on any occasion to prove his value, a final one at least. That opportunity comes with a rather bizarre sight (but plausible in the film's context), a man and a pregnant woman, dressed like immigrants who'd just embarked on Ellis Island come to visit Sally. The man (Robert Joy) happens to be her husband and he's impregnated her own sister Chrissie (Hollis McLaren). Chrissie is a flower-child who believes in Karma and reincarnation and seems to live in the same bubble of peaceful naivety than Kate, no wonder that the two women get along togetherThe brother, however, had other goals in mind, involving a heroin sample he stole in Philadelphia, which he's planning to sell... for dramatic results. The turn of events all leads up to Lou handling the drug deals and getting more and more money, enough to buy a brand new suit, to seduce Sally, passing as a man of the same caliber than those he used to serve, until he encounters the killers who came to get their stuff back. I stop here because the plot, not intricate or complex but captivating in its linear format, is instrumental to the evolution of characters. The drug plot doesn't matter to the degree that it works as a social leverage for a man, Burt Lancaster in his best role, and a gateway for Sally. How it works is all handled by Louis Malle's distant and detached directing.There's no fancy narrative in the film, no particular use of music, except for a fine cameo by Robert Goulet. What John Guare's screenplay accomplishes is simply to tell a story of a city from the perspective of people who want to escape from it, a woman who wants to find a true future and not just be pampered or pimped by a suave manager (Michael Piccoli) and a man who's constantly reminded by his girlfriend that he's a nobody who can only brag about approaching legendary men, if sharing an elevator can ever be called approaching. The end of the film gives a deep and emotionally satisfying feeling of closure to what can be considered a fascinating character study served by two tremendous and nuanced performances.And Atlantic City, the city itself, belongs to that breed of places that are so peculiar that they offer a unique operation theatre for protagonists no matter how ordinary and harmless they are. I don't think there could ever be another masterpiece set in Atlantic City just like there could never be a movie like ""In Bruges"": the town, with its particular texture and old-fashioned charm, insufflates its spirit to the protagonists and gives an existential weight to their most benign actions while attenuating what could be spectacular but cheap plot tricks.To put it simply, set elsewhere, the film, Best Picture nominee of 1981, would have lost half of its impact, but Malle proved two things: if you get the right casting, half the movie works and if you get the right setting, the other half works all the same.",988,0,,0,"No reference.

When father falls ill, he returns and reunites with his sister Juliette (Ana Girardot) and brother Jérémie (François Civil), to sort out stuff between them. Ah families. Their problems and conflicts seem very important for themselves, but are often difficult to understand for bystanders. This is also true for writer-director Cédric Klapisch's latest, slow-burning but quite nice drama about the importance of family and the power of forgiving. The short summary feels sugary, and Klapisch does aim for feel-good, but the movie does not try to manipulate with audience in any tasteless way. It is actually realistic depiction of well-behaved and intelligent family's life, where everybody has their problems but these are not solved in overtly dramatic way often expected from family sagas. This subtle approach doesn't make for very engaging drama, but the feel-good factor is important part of the movie. If you care to invest yourself in these characters' lives, you will probably feel like a part of their group in their end. Which is the best thing this kind of movie can ask for. One can also learn quite a lot about making and appreciating wine. 113 minutes makes it rather long watch, it's not a standout work but quietly confident and satisfying. I don't like international and also Estonian title Back to Burgundy"" (Tagasi Burgundiasse"") which is not as eloquent as the original – directly translated What Links Us"" (Mis meid seob"").

829,1632594,2008-05-06,Witchfinder-General-666,Blood Orgy of the She-Devils (1973),3.0,"""Blood Orgy Of The She Devils"" - an awesome title, that raises hopes for an ultra-sleazy and gory 70s Explotitation effort full of gratuitous female nudity, chopped off limbs etc. Unfortunately Ted V. Mikels' film, which is nonetheless slightly entertaining for its trashiness, is a very tame, and often boring yawner, that does not nearly come up to what the title promises. As it often was the case with films with an extremely low budget, this was given a title that has little to nothing to do with the actual film in order to lure viewers into theaters. The film itself is an absolutely ridiculous mess, but even though often too boring, it has its amusing moments. The film has a ridiculous and confused plot dealing with witchcraft, which revolves around an occult voodoo circle lead by a witch named Mara. Mara has supernatural powers which she can use to communicate with the dead as well as for other black magic purposes. When she includes a pretty young woman in her unholy circle, the girl's boyfriend and best friend consider a doctor who is an expert for the occult. The doctor, basically the hero of the film, is constantly talking in 'sophisticated' nonsensical phrases about witchcraft. The performances are terrible, but terrible performances are something I can forgive in low-budget cinema. What I missed were the exploitative factors, namely the expected gore and sleaze. The popularity of Michael Reeves' British Horror masterpiece ""Witchfinder General"" starring the great Vincent Price spawned a number of violent 'Hexploitation' films about witch-hunts, most prominently the notorious (and great) ""Mark Of The Devil"". Director Mikels also tried to jump on the bandwagon here, and ""Blood Orgy Of The She-Devils"" therefore includes two flashbacks to the time of witch-hunts, which are incredibly corny, but probably even so the best scenes in the film. Mikels is probably best known for ""The Corpse Grinders"" of 1972, which has a certain cult status, and which I have yet to see. ""Blood Orgy Of The She Devils"" is certainly not the nasty Exploitation film the title suggests, but merely a quite tame, and very very silly little film that mildly amuses but bores even more. It somehow reminded me of ""Snake People"", an extremely odd low budget-production which happened to be one of the last films starring the great Horror icon Boris Karloff. The difference is that this one doesn't star Karloff. ""Blood Orgy Of The She Devils"" has its amusing moments, and fans of (awful) cult cinema can consider watching it. Others should avoid it.

843,1529818,2007-10-23,TOMASBBloodhound,Creepshow (1982),9.0,"Movies based on Stephen King writings are pretty hit and miss. This collection of five short horror tales absolutely hits the mark. Many of King's celluloid failures can be attributed to poor direction and casting. With Creepshow, we have a skilled director (Romero) and a wonderfully layered cast of older and up-and-coming actors. The film is intended to look like a comic book in terms of angles and lighting, but it doesn't go over the top like say, Dick Tracy from 1990. The film is genuinely frightening, suspenseful, funny, and gory when it needs to be. The film begins and ends with the story of an abusive father and the revenge taken by his son after the father throws out his comic book containing these five stories. The stories are all somewhat different in tone and structure, but they are all at least somewhat effective.The first story entitled ""Father's Day"" is kind of on the goofy side. There really isn't a whole lot to it, and it kind of serves as a warm-up act. The focus of the story is a deceased patriarch rising from his grave and demanding the cake he was denied when he was murdered by his daughter on Father's Day. Look out for a young Ed Harris who gets crushed by an enormous headstone. There are some scares in this one, but it's more silly than anything else.Stephen King is the star of the next story entitled ""The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill"". In it, he plays a hillbilly who comes in contact with a meteorite that lands on his property. After touching it with his bare hands and burning his fingers, he attempts to cool it off with a bucket of water. The results are somewhat funny, and nothing is particularly frightening about this story. King is a hoot, but the way he eventually dies is actually kind of depressing. Poor guy! The third story entitled ""Something to Tide You Over"" is one of the best. Leslie Neilson plays a sadistic rich man out to torment his wife and her lover (a young Ted Danson) by burying them up to their necks on the beach while the tide comes in over them. Even though Neilson is playing a dirty SOB, you can see the lighthearted side of him just dying to come out. It's really a pretty neat story, though rather predictable. The ending is decidedly unsettling.""The Crate"" is next, and it's a long one compared to the others. The terrific cast including Hal Holbrook, Fritz Weaver, and Adrienne Barbeau are very good, but this one needed some tightening. The payoffs are quick and gory, but it takes maybe too long to get to the conclusion. This episode has some very tense moments, as well as some very funny ones.Finally, we have ""They're Creeping Up On You"". This one is perhaps my favorite. It has E. G. Marshall playing a Howard Hughes type germophobe living in a supposedly germ-proof penthouse. Trouble is, there seems to be a cockroach scurrying across the floor or counter in every scene. We get a sense for just what a creep this man is by hearing him conduct business over the phone and make various demands of those who work for him. He is a really foul-mouthed chap whose world comes crashing down once the power goes out in his building. The final scene is absolutely disgusting and has to hold some kind of record for most roaches ever on one set. This segment is quick, funny, and very creepy.The work as a whole is worth at least 9 of 10 stars. Don't miss it! The Hound.",607,0,,0,"No reference.

The only way this MIGHT have worked had they made there a latent homosexual undertone to all this. But there wasn't and the film often makes no sense at all!

Dirk Bogarde plays the crook, Frank, and he plays him very well. This is no surprise, as Bogarde played many sociopathic creeks and played them well during this era. He does his best with the material. As for Alexis Smith, her character as the Doc's wife is terrible--and clichéd. And, the husband, played by Alexander Knox, is the worst of all...a man who makes himself a virtual eunuch in his own home!

The bottom line is that while the film has its moments, the plot is simply hopeless and a couple dumb characters make it all the worse.

From the moment we meet Buck, his looks and mannerisms reflect the humanization of the dog. Being a dog owner, I really disliked this. Reading into a dog's eyes and looks to reflect our human emotions is a fantasy I don't particularly like.Basically, the story goes that Buck is stolen from his owner Judge Miller (Bradley Whitford), in Santa Clara, CA. While with the Judge, Buck had the run of Miller's home, and the opening scenes we see him eating whatever food he can find, and then he ruins a whole table full of food, by sampling or eating more food than a dog, of that size, could ever eat.Now stolen from his home, Buck is shipped to Alaska and meets John Thornton (Harrison Ford), who is grumpy but sees something in Buck he likes and gives a wry smile.Buck is purchased by the mail delivery team of Perrault (Omar Sy) and Francoise (Cara Lee). Although Buck is a huge dog, he's out of his element because Perrault and Francoise are dog sled mail delivery workers, and Buck has never been a working dog and knows nothing about snow or being a sled pulling dog. He's been a home dog.Buck is mystified by the snow and then becomes demoralized after being hooked up to a harness and asked to pull a sled led by other computer-animated dogs. He does his best but, in a human way, makes mistakes.But CGI Buck decides to become the best dog in the team, which comes across as another human aspect. The lead dog appreciates Bucks's efforts (more human emotions), but the entire movie audience knows what is coming, a confrontation with the lead husky.This confrontation ultimately ends up in glory for Buck, Perrault, and Francois, but as the story would have it, Buck gets sold again to a greedy miner Hal (Dan Stevens) who wants to find gold. He and Thorton get into it, and bad blood arises over Hal's treatment of Buck.Buck escapes Hal, finds Thornton, and they walk together into the wilderness, the call of the wild sort of speak.Together they create an excellent partnership. Upon arriving at a remote cabin, they set up shop, and Buck starts to flirt with and hang out with timberwolves. Of course, there is one final predictable confrontation with Hal, and we all know what will happen.There are lovely and poignant moments, and they mostly revolve around Thornton's grumpy demeanor and Buck's loving, caring way.Not being able to forget just how humanized Buck was made to be, the film's real story about self-redemption and following your dream, was left on the cutting room floor.Ford was terrific as John Thornton, a man who was still mourning the loss of his son. Sy was great and engaging as Perrault, the sled driver. Gee was excellent as Perrault's co-sled team driver. Michael Green wrote this screenplay. There wasn't anything wrong with the screenplay, but the execution of the CGI dog just failed the film. Chris Sanders did a reasonable job of directing this story, but the CGI hurt the effort, and Sanders is part to blame because he allowed too much humanization of Buck.Overall: This was a difficult film to watch because it seemed too made up.",580,0,,0,"No reference.

Supposedly the director's cut is better, but tbh I can't really imagine it improving this pile of over-cgi'd tosh much, and certainly not enough to warrant me wasting another couple of hours.Way too long was spent pointlessly building up Daredevil, and then his relationship with Elektra - you still didn't feel any kind of bond or empathy for them so the first hour or so was a complete waste of time. They went to all the bother of building up Daredevil's relationship with Elektra (or at least trying to, the acting was soo wooden he might as well have been having a relationship with his cane), only to summarily kill her after a particularly lame scene where she tries to kill Daredevil after wrongfully thinking he assassinated her father, only to remove his mask, realize it's her boyfriend and then suddenly go all 'Woops! Ooh, I'm so sorry!'. A far more likely reaction would be 'You bar steward! You only slept with me to get close to my father! Here, take this sai through the throat!'. But even given that, it was still disappointing they didn't have a few minutes as a 'crimefighting duo' where they kicked some bad guy butt before she was killed.And it then went on to a similarly disappointing fight with Kingpin. Oh, I blinked. Is it over? Oh well, there goes two hours of my life down the toilet.But even given all that, I would probably still have given it three stars (there are much worse movies out there, like Battleship), but it loses an extra star for spawning the worst spin off ever made - Elektra.

In a way I could relate to the couple stranded in the middle of the ocean; I went out once on a snorkeling excursion in the Bahamas, and the thought crossed my mind - what if the driver of the boat just decided to leave? The thought by itself isn't all that scary, but every time a shark swam by in this movie it was difficult not to tense up and wonder what was going to happen next. The reality of the film didn't really sink in until Susan (Blanchard Ryan) cast away the corpse of her boyfriend (Daniel Travis), and shortly after decided that her situation was beyond hopeless. I was actually disappointed that she didn't have the courage to hang on for some type of miracle to occur, like one of the rescue boats or planes locating her in that impossible expanse of ocean water.I think the 'based on a true story' aspect of this film only goes so far, virtually everything we observe after the couple is left behind is entirely speculative. I see that the film spawned a sequel, ""Open Water 2: Adrift"", but the better follow up might have been to find out what happened with the negligent crew of the diving charter. Sure they did a head count, but not a roll call, which would have made more sense. The guy who double counted the diver who went in twice, let's see his explanation to an official inquest. Finding the personal belongings of the couple on the boat twenty four hours later also exposed the crew's negligence to some basic protocol.If you internet search the aftermath of the incident depicted in the story, there actually was a trial in the case of the deaths of Tom and Eileen Lonergan, whose bodies were never found to confirm their deaths, although articles of their diving gear were eventually discovered, but without signs of damage that one would expect from a shark attack.

You have to maintain the heart and soul of the story of an alien in a world that doesn't accept an outsider, while also shaping the story around a character who is essentially flawless. Brightburn takes the Superman mythos (whether the filmmakers want to admit it or not) and makes the hard left turn with Clark Kent's origin into horror territory. Brandon Breyer (because every comic character has to have alliteration) decides to use his supernatural abilities for evil, as he torments and murders people in his small town of Brightburn. While it certainly has its entertaining qualities, it fails to capture the horror of the third act because you never really grow to love Brandon as a normal kid anyway. If the first act chose to focus more on the human side of Brandon it could have easily made his turn more devastating and truly horrifying. Instead, it feels more like a low budget 'what if' story that doesn't give us the true payoff of what that question poses.6.2/10",183,0,,0,"No reference.

From all my love to the show I will try to explain why you should give it a chance.What we learn from Supernatural? We learn that struggle will never end for the warrior. Once you win a battle, a brand new challenge appears on your way. The same happens when you lose. And this is how we know life goes on as an immutable law of the Universe.We learn that family is not about your bloodlines, but about people you care of and who care of you. We learn that above all conventionalities there's a power taking care of us all. Every time Sam and Dean get lost, surrender or lose the fight, Life itself speaks to us through them. It says there's always a hope, even if you couldn't imagine this kind of its embodiment. We learn that the greatest power is available to everyone - a power of being a human. We also learn that guys can be so handsome that you ain't able to watch some episodes without distracting by your excitement :) And what we get above this appearance is brilliant acting of Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. With all due respect to other actors of the show, these two men strike right to your heart. They make you laugh and suffer together with their characters and you can't remember the moment when you've got so involved. If you let the Supernatural world come in your life you will discover a world of Courage, Love, Loyalty, Losses, Defeats and Desperation. And those ain't just words, you will feel each emotion deeply through the stories told by Winchester brothers. You will be exhausted with them after all the fights and you will be moved to tears about how beautiful our life is. Beautiful enough to always keep fighting on you way.",321,0,,0,"No reference.

Pat Healy, who I realized was in a bunch of stuff I watched over the years without ever really catching my attention, since the parts he played weren't worth a mention. Other than that, I only knew the name, but couldn't attribute to it anything of importance. If anyone had asked me about who I thought Pat Healy was, I would have told them that it's Patricia Healy they're talking about, some kind of female musician. Taylor Schilling's a different story. I definitely knew who she was, even without ever watching an episode of Orange Is The New Black. I saw her in The Overnight, a movie which kinda stuck with me, because it had some really interesting moments. Undoubtedly, an attractive woman, who is on the path of becoming a very good actress, due to the characters she chooses to play. This is certainly not the first (or last) comedy about a kidnapping situation, but nonetheless it's a funny one. It made me laugh, which, considering the volume of comedies I've watched over the years, is not an easy task. Don't get me wrong, this is not as brilliant as the classic A Fish Called Wanda, but it's still very enjoyable. 6.5/10",227,0,,0,"No reference.

Jack plans to use the money on his girlfriend (Pim Bubear) who he loves very much. However, what he doesn't know is that he is actually robbing from Asian crime lord Sirankiri (Steven Seagal). Soon Jack is forced into robbing even more banks and now the police are after him as well as Sirankiri.This is the first Seagal movie I've seen since his 1997 film FIRE DOWN BELOW. I knew that the actor had gone into the direct-to-video craze but I honestly just wasn't big enough of a fan to check out all of these movies. THE Asian CONNECTION grabbed my attention because I read some really negative reviews on it so I decided to check it out myself.There's no question that the awful reviews were right on the mark because this is a pretty darn bad movie no matter how you look at it. Obviously it was done on a very low-budget but the problem is that it's so poorly made that you just get bored by all of it. The direction by Daniel Zirilli is certainly a major issue because the action scenes all look horrible and there's not a single moment where the film contains any energy or excitement.Another problem is that you certainly don't care about any of the main characters. The love story subplot between Jack and his girlfriend is laughable at times and even everything with Seagal is pretty bland and boring. John Edward Lee's performance is also quite bad and it appears Seagal is just picking up a paycheck as he does very little with his role.THE Asian CONNECTION is a really bad movie that doesn't have a thing going for it.",302,1,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Horror is mainly viewed by teenagers and men with a love for scares and horror always triumphs over fellow genres. Women tend to get scared while watching horror movies and that's why they prefer watching ""Romance"". Horror has it all: action, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, etc. but it is better than all other genres. Movies like The Ring, Grudge, Psycho, Scream, and Poltergeist, never have scared me while The Exorcist made me cr*p in my pants. Who would've thought that an 1980s movie could scare you. I certainly expected it to be a low-budget horror movie without any scares but I was wrong. In 1980s the graphics and make up can't compare with what we have today but The Exorcist didn't need lots of money or good makeup because it offered more than any other horror movie so far (2010). The story is intense and pretty terrifying but that's whats good about this movie. In the first two minutes it was all boring but then it reaches its potential and always achieve higher than it should and for that we are blessed to have great directors. The performances by Max Von Sydow is excellent along with Lee J. Cobb and Ellen Burstyn but the real show catcher is that sweet little girl who gets possessed by the devil himself, and that lady is Linda Blair. She really gave it her best from the point to where she was human to when she gets possessed. Her devil act really had me shaking and screaming as she talked with a voice full of horror and dread. She has achieved a great career in film industry so far. The Christian theme will have some religious people p*ssed of and so be cautious when you are watching The Exorcist. Strange thing is that the novel is somewhat scarier than the film.A mysterious entity has stolen 12 year-old Regan's body and is using it to commit sins. Her mother is terrified and doesn't know what to do to stop this entity from wrecking hell. She seeks the help of a priest named Father Merrin for he is the one who can exorcise this girl and stop the demon once and for all. Be warned horror lovers even you will die of a heart attack so be cautious and have the remote in your hand for it will become handy! Mwahahhahhaha! Sorry about that evil laugh. Mwahahhaha! If you don't like spoilers, skip this part. Read the first word in the next sentence! (Spoiler!!!!) Regan has been quite naughty and she has been doing naughty acts for instance, the spider walk scared the hell outta people while the spinning head made people look away. Maybe vomiting on somebody can surely be dirty and Regan has done just that. I know someone will have a hard time washing that shirt. (SPOILER END!!!!) Nothing can compare, in film history, to that demonic voice spoken by the possessed Regan and it is one of the most original and best voices in film. The 1980s style well have you enjoying The Exorcist a bit more for those of you who have lived through the eighties in America. The Exorcist is my favorite film of William Friedkin and can you guys please watch this for my and many others sake. If you don't then shame on you for being so ignorant because you are missing out on the best horror film that will be and is the best in film history. I really loved the screenplay, script, performances by some, the novel by William Peter Blatty, and definitely the sound. The most definitive movie about possession has been made thirty years ago and it still is definitive to this day. Gore lovers will be disappointed because The Exorcist does not need gore to succeed but a good, solid, and a scary story. Sorry. Mwahhahahah! Goodbye!",665,0,,0,"No reference.

Suburban Commando and Mr. Magoo, I'm looking at you! But not directly, because that has proved a hazardous practice. And then there's of course this. It's not just those two, either; nothing in this is worth as much as a brief smirk or chuckle. Also wasted is Matt McCoy who you may remember from... uh... well... give me a minute... The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. Yeah. That'll do. The three are given so little material to work with that their performances in this aren't particularly memorable, and yet they are by far the best of the bunch. It's no surprise that the kids are the worst. The girl is especially unconvincing. Having forgotten the concept of humor, the writer settles for coming up with a bunch of weird quirks(!), and hopes that it'll pass for character development, as well.

It occurred the first time in 1945's ""Conflict"", but in that picture, it was Bogey's character who did the pursuing, while here, it's Cecily Latham (Smith) who intrudes on Geoffrey Carroll's marriage to the second Mrs. Carroll of the title. By that time though, Sally Morton (Barbara Stanwyck) had already been the 'other woman' to the first Mrs.C., who we only know by the 'Angel of Death' painting. Taking a chapter from ""Bluebeard"", Bogey's character is an artist who paints his victims before they succumb to a spiked milk cocktail.It's never made clear how chemist Blagdon (Barry Bernard) figures out that Mr. Carroll is the customer who signs for his prescriptions as Fleming. But if he was that sharp, he should also have concluded that if Carroll was deranged enough to kill his first wife by poisoning, then knocking off a druggist wouldn't be much of a stretch. Too bad, he turned the screws just a little too tight for his own good.Nigel Bruce is quite adequate depicting a country doctor who looks in on the Carroll's, you might call his performance right as rain. It's Dr. Tuttle's single minded obsession with an Ashton burglar and a Yorkshire strangler that gives Mr.C the idea for his farewell plans for wife number two. If only he'd have cut the phone line a minute sooner.Perhaps the surprise performance in this tale belongs to the actress portraying daughter Bea, an unusually precocious Ann Carter. Watching her, it was almost impossible to believe that a child could converse with the language she used. It was somewhat irritating though to see how compliant she was with every single idea her father advanced, especially going away to school. I think she could have done some damage once the fireworks started.Bogart and Stanwyck are genuinely competent in their roles; Stanwyck in particular turning things up a notch when it becomes clear that she could wind up a murder victim. The pair had generally good chemistry together, and seemed to be a better match than the intruder Cecily might have been with Mr. Carroll. Chalk that up to a fine performance by Alexis Smith, as this viewer found it hard to warm up to her character. Bogart fans might have some fun comparing his performance here against his similar character in the aforementioned ""Conflict"", a film which for my two cents is the stronger of the two.",426,0,,0,"No reference.

Anyway, Trey & Matt aren't the only voice actors in this movie, there's also Maurice Lamarche, Jeremy Shada, & Daran Norris as Spotswood.

But Gerald's Game proved me wrong. There are so many hidden aspects of this movie that you just don't expect. Carla Gugino's performance as the main character, Jessie, is fantastic and she manages to carry the movie practically all by herself. Jessie's character is slowly dissected throughout and it's living through her struggles - past and present - that keeps you hooked and wanting to watch more. The relationship between Jessie and her husband Gerald is authentic and believable. Even the character of Gerald (played by Bruce Greenwood), who was in the movie for a very short period of time, brought an element of fear and tension to the movie, when his sexual preferences suggest there may be a more sinister side to him. Admittedly, it is slow in parts and there are areas where it starts to drag, but ultimately it's an engaging movie throughout. By delving into Jessie's psyche it has you doubt her mental state and what is real and what isn't, but also allows viewers to form a connection with her and sympathise with her as a character. The ending has a twist that I didn't see coming, which I'm still unsure about. Was it genius or was it silly? I'll let you be the judge of that.

But this one, whilst most certainly not impressing me at all, is neither bad enough for me to slate it, nor good enough for me to sing it's praises.Quite simply, I'm not sure what Burton was trying to do here. I understand all the metaphors and allegories that are present, but the ultimate goal of the film eludes me. Was it to make me think about how I relate to my father? Was it trying to tell me that not all stories are made up, or true? Was it simply trying to point out the difficulties of having a larger than life personality in a boring, mundane world? Is it all of the above? And, at the end, do we actually care?A film has to be entertaining on some level in order to keep the audience's attention. BF does this, but only just. At no point do you feel any great empathy for the character of the Father, as told in his stories.

But they are not alone, since they have help from John's loyal jail guard old crippler Grumpy (Walter Brennan), a young eager gunslinger Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson), a kind man who owns the hotel/saloon (Perdo Gonzalez Gonzalez) and a clever care-free woman named Feathers (Angie Dickension), who finds Chance interesting.Directed by Howard Hawks (His Girl Friday, Red River, Scarface) made an intelligent Western that has a big heart, great performance, creative action sequences and an refreshing sense of humour. I never seen this movie until now, although i heard of Hawks. I never seen his films before. I did see ""The Thing from Another World"". Which he co-directed but he's uncredited. The picture still looks great, since it's been nearly 50 years ago it came out. This is very well filmed by cinematographer Russell Harlan, which he's makes this feature looks stylish for its time. There's many good sequences... especially when it's character-driven dialogue scenes, moments of romance or action.The two-disc set from ""Rio Bravo"". DVD is been digitally remastered for clean picture-quality and sound. Disc 1 has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono Sound. DVD includes trailers from other ""John Wayne"" pictures and an informative if somewhat quiet commentary by ""Time"" film critic:Richard Schickel and filmmaker:John Carpenter (Assault on Precient 13, Halloween, The Thing). Disc 2 includes an documentary about Howard Hawks' film-making career, featurette on ""Rio Bravo"" with interviews from cast member Dickenson, film critics & fans of this movie and a small featurette about the film's location and the other classic Westerns were filmed there. ""Rio Bravo"" is a movie that still looks good after 50 years, it shows how strong that this feature could such an impact over all these years. Some viewers might find this silly at times, especially when the Characters start bonding and singing in the sheriff's station. But it's all in good fun, probably the only complaint in this movie. It's goes on a bit too long than it should. But still, don't miss this excellent movie. Screenplay by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett (The Empire Strikes Back, The Big Sleep, The Long Goodbye).

The actor are normal not the best but not the worst But there a couple of scenes that are pretty cool just like when the zombies are walking to the church or the scene when the characters discover the corpses of the wife and there's some likable character but nothing else and fulci put more action in the last part of the film which is good but nothing else Does anybody thing that the zombies looks like the dead in the beyond??,260,0,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

The episode opens in Forthaven's bar; a strange man enters and asks for a drink then instead of handing over a card he drops a handful of diamonds in payment! Not surprisingly this creates a bit of a stir and he ends up in a fight with the Expeditionaries.

Stella, Jack and a tracker follow when they realise they are missing and that the strange man is Pak, part of the original group to land on Carpathia many years before. Meanwhile back in Forthaven people are obsessed with finding diamonds of their own which leads to an unusual agreement between Julius and Tate although it seems likely that the former is just using the situation to further his own agenda.This episode had some gripping moments and gave the makers an excuse to show off some beautiful South African scenery as Fleur, Cass and Pak trek to the sea. Once again things are hinted at rather than explicitly explained; it is said the Pat murdered the leader of his group but we never learn if he did or if something else happened; we also don't know if the animals he sees are imaginary or part of some strange phenomena on Carpathia.

My local streets were full of Saracens and Pigs and the skies reverberated with the noise of Westland Scouts and Sioux helicopters, and we had these strange men in flak jackets (usually stuck together with black tape) with hugely long rifles, talking in strange accents, running across streets and hiding behind fences. And, of course, being killed. This series did its' best to reflect that; no whys or wherefores, no politics or hand wringing, just men in a situation that for better or worse had found them in a corner of the United Kingdom facing bricks, bombs and bullets. A lot of it reflected what I saw every day, and I'm sure the Barracks life they depicted was familiar to many an old soldier. It wasn't sensationalist, as many programmes made today are, nor did it give a sense of being larger than life. It just was life, every day, warts and all, and all the more real for that. My only gripe is the depiction of the Northern Ireland Police - the RUC - as there are errors in the uniform and equipment depicted, but if you can get hold of a copy - it's available on DVD these days - it's a real nostalgia trip into the pre-mobile phone and Internet era of old cars, dirty streets and dead-end lives.

But if I do away that ending and replace it with the novel's ending from William March I really cannot fault this movie. Even though differing from the book as in leaving some characters out (only 1 Fern sister instead of 3 and Leroy's wife is not in the movie), adding Christine's father Richard Bravo as ""living"" character and scrapping the scenes where Leroy interacts with his wife; the movie captures the spirit of the book perfectly. Well the movie feels stagy which is normal because it was a play before it became a movie. Also most of the stage players would eventually reprise their role in the movie which probably shows why the characters work so well together. Really everyone plays their role sublime no one was miscast. Kudos mostly to Nancy Kelly as mother Christine and the young Patty McCormack as little Rhoda. She would eventually feature as titular character in the Mommy movies in the 1990s where she shows similar personality treats as in The Bad Seed but there as an adult. It doesn't matter how many times I watch this movie and that it is old and tame to today's standards. It's message remains powerful and disturbing. The icing on the cake are for me the interactions between Rhoda and Leroy. Both of them are interesting character studies, a mean bully versus a manipulative child that sure gives fireworks, literally! But also the case of mother Christine is seriously an interesting one and that of serial killer Bessie Denker who was based on a real killer and the inspiration of March's novel.",288,0,,0,"No reference.

And I on occasion watch the reruns on late night TV on cable's/satellite's TNT(Turner Network Television). The original show had charm to it but this reunion lacked that charm and a decent story line.""CHiPs"" 99 seemed more like a two hour version of a 60 minute episode that would not end. The made for TV movie was inconsistent with the original TV series. Larry Wilcox, who portrayed Officer John Baker left the show the year before it was canceled. So the following season the show wrote him off by having him go to work on the family farm/ranch. So, for the reunion, Officer Baker somehow becomes a captain, mean while Officer Francis ""Ponch"" Poncherello, Erik Estrada had disappeared because his wife was ""sick."" Its funny that in the made for TV flick there is one scene in which Baker tells Ponch that he was not invited to his wedding because he did not know where he was. In real life during the shows peak I read that Erik Estrada had not invited Wilcox to his wedding and when Wilcox was married he did the same. I just think its funny that the producers decided to actually put that into the storyline. Seems like it would have brought up some bad blood or the producers had some twisted sense of humor.I wish that the producers for this special would have elected to use at least a cliché cop reunion special storyline. Something like all the old cops get back together to help find the murderer of one of their own, Harlan gets killed during a carjacking. Or Ponch gets framed for a string of carjacking murders and Baker comes out of retirement to help his buddy out. Even those story lines would have been far more enjoyable. Its like the producers rehashed an old episode and went on autopilot. Oh and Baker and Ponch appear on Judge Judy within the show because a neighbor's dog is damaging Baker's lawn. And Johnny Cochran makes a guest appearance for the neighbor that Baker is suing. Can we say lame, really lame.The special also had several of the original cast but the only ones that were really utilized were Estrada, Wilcox, and Robert Pine (Sgt.

But while Deathdream moved me to tears, I am not sure of this movie had any impact on me at all. For such a sad story, the impact is quite less. The performances are good but maybe there are problems with the pacing and the script. The things that happen are so clichéd and everything's been done before in much better ways.

Pero 'Lo que el viento se llevó' es la obra maestra de la industria cinematográfica, la obra maestra de un productor y de un equipo de artistas y artesanos con un objetivo común: hacer la mejor película de la historia cinematográfica estadounidense hasta esa fecha, 1.939. Bajo la dirección estuvieron George Cukor, Sam Wood y el mismísimo David Selznick además de Victor Fleming, que fue quien la acabó y quien rodó toda la segunda parte del filme. En el aspecto musical, para dar redondez al esplendoroso trabajo de Max Steiner, se había contratado a William Axt y a Franz Waxman además de poner a orquestadores de la Warner a componer como Adolph Deutsch, Hugo Friedhofer o Heinz Roemheld. No hay nada más que ver la cantidad de nombres del personal que trabajó para esta producción para darse cuenta de las dimensiones del proyecto para esa época.Y luego está el guión, ese guión cuyas frases se han hecho célebres a lo largo de décadas, con magníficos diálogos de inolvidable memoria que vertebran el curso narrativo de una historia imperecedera que no decae en ningún momento y que va acelerando el interés del público conforme va avanzando el metraje. Un guión igualmente de equipo con Sidney Howard a la cabeza pero con talentos fuera de lo común como Ben Hecht o Jo Swerling.En los estrenos de 1939 pocas fueron las actuaciones que se pudieron ver en las salas de cine tan subyugantes como las que aportaron las actrices y los actores de 'Lo que el viento se llevó'. Y si uno analiza los trabajos de Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland o de maravillosos secundarios como Thomas Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel, Ward Bond o Harry Davenport, la inolvidable aportación de Butterfly McQueen como 'Prissy', observa que en pocos filmes de estas características desarrolla su elenco tanta calidad como en 'Lo que el viento se llevó'.Fotografía, vestuario, maquillaje y peluquería asi como el decorado con esas máscaras pintadas como fondos, auténticas obras de arte del diseño y la pintura, sumaron detalles de una enorme calidad artística que hicieron a mi juicio de 'Lo que el viento se llevó' el mejor melodrama épico de la Historia del Cine. Un melodrama, por otra parte, que se zambulle en otros géneros; en el bélico a través de los temas de la barbarie y la sinrazón de la guerra, y en el del oeste a través de los temas de la cargas de la caballería y el expolio a los civiles.En resumen, una obra maestra absoluta que perdurará en la memoria de quien la contemple bajo los acordes de 'El tema de Tara' (tema principal) de Max Steiner, de quien el célebre director de orquesta y compositor Leonard Bernstein afirmó que ninguna música como la de Steiner para 'Lo que el viento se llevó' exportó tanta popularidad de la cultura musical americana al extranjero.Imprescindible para coleccionistas del buen cine.",515,0,,0,"No reference.

It works when it wants to and it does have its funny moments. Although considering other Disney films,it doesn't have as many laughs but I think that works because then it makes the comedic scenes all the more funny,especially the sergeant's back story and the laffy taffy which are some of the highlights of the film. As far as the characters go,I think they're decent enough. Sergeant Calhoun is a pretty good character with a hilariously tragic back story installed, Vanellope is just annoyingly cute, Fix it Felix Jr is a likable character as is Ralph. But the character that stood out has to be King Candy. My favourite aspect about him is the design,I just love how much the design and his personality is based off the mad hatter and it shows throughout. Now for the things I didn't like. The pace of the film is a bit distracting as about forty five minutes in, Vanellope is already being introduced and from then on,you're pretty much stuck in Sugar Rush. There are a few cut away scenes but they don't last for more the five minutes. Another thing that I didn't particularly like was the training sequence. The scene itself was good but I felt the song they chose to go with it felt out of place and it didn't go with it. But my biggest gripe about this film is the 'I'm bad and that's good. I will never be good,and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me.' thing.

Bill Skarsgard and Tom Holland were most likely my two favourites. When I was reading the pages of Donald Ray Pollocks writing, it almost seems like he was writing about Skarsgard and Holland. They embody the characters of Willard and Arvin perfectly and I will continue to imagine them as the father and son. Holland shows some real acting chops here and I truly hope he gets some awards attention for his great performance here. I hope that he takes more roles like this in the future and doesn't just stick to big budget lifeless Spider-Man movies, I'm excited to see him in Cherry, if that still releases this year.The cinematography was great and the 35mm feel to it all worked seamlessly to set the old Southern tone of the story. I really respect the choice to shoot on film and when you watch the film the grain covering the screen almost comes across as dirt or dust and adds so much to the style of the film.The main issue I have with the film is the use of a narrorator. This films use of narrotation is the laziest choice I have seen in a film in recent memory. I honest to god would've given this film a much higher rating if they just removed the absolutely pointless narroration. You can tell what the actor is feeling, I don't need it explained to me that Arvin is feeling sad, I KNOW HE'S SAD! I'm also well aware that the novel had a narrorator as well, but there's a huge diffrence between writing a novel and writing a film. You can't see a character walk into a building in a book it's not a visual medium, in a film you can see an actor weep or show the emotion the narrorator is telling the audience they're feeling. There's a classic rule to storytelling which is to show, not to tell. This film attempts to do both and drags the excellent quality of the rest of the film down substantially.I'm also torn on the changes to many elements of Arvin's motivations here. In the book there was a real sense that Arvin not just had a sisterly love for Lenora but also a sexual one and I didn't really get that impression here. I know it's weird, but I felt the film cheated a bit not including that element. Also, the changed circumstances behind the films final act and the character of Roy are strange to see be changed, but I do not hate the differences here as they do progress the story a lot faster than the book.In conclusion, The Devil All The Time has some wonderful performances, ideas, cinematography and directing, however unfortunately the film doesn't entirely live up to the incredibly high standards of Donald Ray Pollack's masterpiece novel and the inclusion of narroration to dumb down the story is a very bad decision.Honestly, someone needs to make a cut of this film without the narroration and it would honestly be a substantially better film.",560,0,,0,"No reference.

Its songs are generally excellent, there are individually impressive sequences but the whole is less than the sum of its parts. As Camelot draws to its climax, one can't help but feel a slight sense of disappointment; a feeling, perhaps, that the opportunity for something fabulous has been missed. It's a good film, yes, but not a brilliant one.Reluctant King Arthur (Richard Harris) prefers to spend his time wandering in the marshes rather than carrying out his kingly duties. When he is betrothed to be married to Guinevere (Vanessa Redgrave) – whom he has never even met – he considers running away to avoid the marriage. Guinevere also has her doubts about the union and plots to run away. By chance, the two of them meet in the marshes and promptly fall in love. Later, they come up with the idea of forming a selective band of knights, the Round Table, where the greatest horsemen, swordsmen, archers and warriors can join up to protect the land. ""Might for right"" as Arthur proudly declares. Many knights are eager to join, one of the last being Frenchman Lancelot Du Lac (Franco Nero). Arthur is thrilled to have Lancelot among his trusty followers, but Guinevere initially dislikes the French knight, despising his too-perfect attitude and dedication and continual tall-stories about previous feats. However, following a remarkable joust during which Lancelot somehow revives a seemingly dead man, a flicker of affection develops between he and Guinevere. It eventually blossoms into a full-blown scandalous affair, and when Arthur learns of his wife's infidelity he must take the difficult decision of how to deal with her and her disgraced lover.Much has been made of the decision to use mainly non-singing actors in this film. This inexperience is slightly noticeable during Harris and Redgrave's musical numbers, but not to such a degree that it destroys the film. Nero's songs are dubbed, perhaps wisely (his spoken dialogue is tricky enough to decipher due to his accent, so one assumes any singing he did in person must have been pretty incomprehensible). The film is spectacular and lavish throughout, with wonderful sets and costumes and a clutch of classic scenes. The jousting sequence in particular is quite brilliantly done. Unfortunately there are frequent dull patches too, where things drag on rather pointlessly and plot developments are hammered home with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The three hour running time is ultimately too long by at least 30 minutes, but amidst the over-indulgence there remain enough plus points to make Camelot worth a look.",453,0,,0,"No reference.

The less-populated colony serves mostly as cheap labour for UFB, traversing daily by dropping directly through the Earth via ""the Fall"", a gravity elevator taking the most direct route to the other side of the world. Amongst those who commute is factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), happily married to Lori (Kate Beckinsale), but still with a lingering feeling of emptiness. When co-worker Mac (John Cho) convinces Quaid to seek the services of Rekall, a semi-legal company dealing with computer imprinted dreams, he decides to take on the visage of an special agent. The resulting programme initiation brings about an unexpected realisation, that Quaid has repressed memories, as in fact in the past he once was a secret double agent of the UFB and opposing insurgents. Thus his beloved wife is a hoax, with his true love being rebel Melina (Jessica Biel). Or is it?Remolding vast parts of the 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick and the Arnold Schwarzeneggar original feature brings together a dishevelled story, which at times seems all too reminiscent borrowing vast sequences and moments from its superior predecessor, while at others bringing about wholesale changes which detrimentally make the trip overly fantastic, even for a sci-fi movie. Nonetheless ""Total Recall"" features a visually stunning future metropolis, albeit borrowing undoubted inspiration from the ""Bladerunner"" with a touch ""The Fifth Element"", still comes off as original and breathtaking, undoubtedly the highlight of what is otherwise a disappointing venture into the whacked out mind of American novelist Philip K. Dick. In search of some mode to forward the story Len Wiseman changes the whole movie into a prolonged triangle cat-fight, where Lori has the knack for appearing in every other scene, at times seemingly self-teleporting herself or even rising from the dead, to enter into a brutal marriage spat with Quaid or direct her aggressive brutality towards Melina. Making Lori into what is basically the key antagonist, especially given her paper-thin character development and Beckinsale's lazy portrayal, proves especially distracting, as the narratives inexplicably suffers. Not much is helped by Jessica Biel, the third in this misguided lover's triangle, who does an absolutely atrocious acting job, losing many acting creds and coming off as pure eye candy. With all these factors kicking in not even the undoubted screen presence of Colin Farrell can bring the movie back on board. Labored with some conspicuous plot tools such as the introduction of Hammond (played by Dylan Scott Smith) an essentially conceptless ""Total Recall"" lacks any longevity with its limited sensibility.",462,0,,0,"No reference.

What makes the best story? One that leaves you asking questions. It's what pulls you in as a reader/watcher and makes you invested in the environment/world the story takes place in. This is why, in part, Star Wars (1977) did so well. It left you asking questions, like: The Empire? what's that? whats a lightsaber? (that was a question at one point) who are the jedi?who are Luke's parents? why does this Ben dude know him? what's the rebellion? how did this all start? han solo himself, an air of mystery various questions raised by the size of the universe, planets, alien species, etcThen there's the steampunk feel of the original Star Wars movies.tatooine: dirty, gritty, old, broken, bleak, organic, rusted death star: shiny, metallic, obsidian, visual weight forest places: wooden, organic, stone overall: things built into the environment, like Luke's home on tattoine and the yavin 4 base/templeThen story/character development: lost, isolated, ""nobody"" characters getting swept up into a larger story and finding purpose, meaning, and hope. You might even say destiny. A small subset of this was the consistent casting of up-and-coming/no-name actors as the character leads in the following films.In my opinion, all of the above is what DEFINES Star Wars. This is why, when they announced the new films in 2012, I was particularly interested in seeing them hold to these ideals. As I followed the production process, I was looking for evidence that they were holding to those ideals, or at least hopefully wayyyyyyy more than Lucas' prequel trilogy.Going into the new film, I was mostly concerned with them capturing the look and feel of the original movies. I determined that if they got that right, the story could be appreciated more. Since they got Lawrence Kasdan (writer of the Empire Strikes Back, my favorite movie) on board with writing credits along with JJ Abrams and Michael Arndt (both huge Star Wars fans), I was less concerned with the story they wrote than they means they chose to convey it. I was a little concerned about the reprisal of characters from the original trilogy that are WELL on in years, but I didn't put much thought into it because I knew the story wasn't going to be about them.I'm happy to say: JJ ABRAMS AND CO DID NOT LET US DOWN.The look and feel of the original movies has been captured here. They built real sets and props, by hand, but weren't afraid to lean on the use of digital technology as needed. The result is a movie filled with gritty, organic places that just plain and simple...feel real. The digital effects, are soooooooo good too. Probably the most real-looking lightsaber effects I've ever seen.The newest cast members, while no-namers, are FANTASTIC. The older actors really shine through as well, a lot more than I thought, honestly. Especially Harrison Ford, he really manages to still capture the same spirit that makes him Han Solo, despite being considerably older. The new story raises plenty of questions as well, really setting the stage for the following films and what's to come. But, as I've hinted at, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the film on the look and feel alone. Let's also not forget NEW STAR WARS MUSIC. The newest John Williams score is fantastic, and is essential to capturing the magic of what Star Wars feels like. The only criticism I have for the OST release is that we don't get to hear the main character themes fleshed out quite as much as we do in the movie, mostly cause of the prevalence of action-carrying motifs and sequences.

With that, this is still worth everyone's time and it's a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion it's better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror! Story takes place in the small German town of Klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks. Burgermister Gustave Schoen (Lionel Belmore) shouts ""It's Vampires"" but the local police chief Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas) thinks it's a madman who's responsible and he vows to catch him.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The Burgermeister and most of the towns folk think that the local kook Herman Glieb (Dwight Frye) who loves bats and frequently talks to them is the one they are looking for and they chase him until he falls to his death in a cave. The one who is responsible for the killings is Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who has created a new form of tissue mass that feeds on blood and he accomplishes this by having some sort of mind control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazer) who goes out at night to collect the blood. Dr. Otto has a pretty assistant named Ruth Bertin (Fay Wray) and an annoying aunt named Gussie (Maude Eburne) but they have no clue what he's up to but Karl eventually become suspicious when one of the murders takes place after Herman's death.Frank R. Strayer was never confused with being James Whale but he was a pretty competent director who ended up directing most of the ""Blondie"" films in that series and with this film he uses the same sets from ""The Old Dark House"" which was also filmed at Universal. I'm the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but it's practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including Frye who is pretty much doing his Renfield role only this time he befriends bats and strokes them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping! One thing that just doesn't make sense is the mind control that Dr. Otto has over Emil as the film never explains this and I had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" but on the other hand it's probably just the weakest part of the script. There are a few other tidbits that I noticed including the chase of Frye to the big caves which is obviously an early shot of the infamous Bronson Canyon where numerous other films have been made and also Wray's brown hair which is her true color.

The white collar couple is very ""careful"" about having a kid, so careful they don't end up having a kid at all. On the other hand, the trailer trash basically cannot hiccup without producing a kid.

This movie has one big thing going for it, a very different story. I was happy to see that there was no ""head spinning"" or ""pea soup"" scenes. They took the idea of ""The Exorcist"" and took it in a completely different direction. I don't think this movie is a classic, but with the crap horror movies that get made these days, this one stands up very well. I rank it right up there with the under-rated ""Exorcist III"". Overall this movie will please all horror fans that like to use their minds. If you're looking for a slasher, this isn't it. I can see that it has become popular to go on line and rip movies, and this movie doesn't play to those 18 year old kids.

927,4737050,2020-02-20,AdrianPK,Ying xiong (2002),10.0,"It's strange to consult a thesaurus for words that mean ""beautiful"" while I'm writing a review of a martial arts epic. But that's what Hero does to its audience. The gravity-defying duels between swordsmen are some of the most spectacular you'll ever see.
As the film opens, the king honors a warrior called Nameless, who has slain three famous assassins that threatened the throne during the conquest. The reward: a private meeting with the king. This hero, played perfectly by international martial arts legend Jet Li, grants the king's wish; he relates the stories of how he outwitted these legendary killers-Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Sky (Donnie Yen).
In the style of Rashomon, Nameless's stories are offered to us in multiple, contradictory flashbacks. Each story he relates raises the king's suspicion and requires a revision. Thus, Nameless and his targets are portrayed in a variety of relationships, sometimes meeting different fates. Each enthralling flashback is portrayed in a distinct array of colors.In one, Nameless and Sky meet in a spectacular duel that's as much a match between their minds as it is between their blades. In another, Nameless helps Broken Sword and Flying Snow defend a calligraphy school from the oncoming forces of the king's warriors. This involves deflecting relentless torrents of arrows that are launched in a siege that resembles the ferocity of The Two Towers' Battle of Helm's Deep. Nameless opposes this siege in order to gain the killers' trust, to learn their weakness, and to defeat them using their own passions for one another. Zhang Ziyi, sporting the same youthful ego and impertinence that she portrayed in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, plays a key role here as Broken Sword's servant, Moon. Two more astonishing clashes-one a breathtaking ballet in a storm of falling yellow leaves, the other a battle on the surface of a magnificent lake-are each worth the price of admission; it's unlikely you'll see anything so memorable all year.
But the most important clash is the one between the hero's narratives and the king's questioning. Nameless is clearly superior to those whose weapons he has claimed and set down before the king. But what has made him such an unparalleled warrior? And what will he ask of the king now that he has performed this feat as a volunteer?
To say more about the plot would be to spoil the story's most interesting twist. And besides, there is much to say in honor of the cast and crew.Nameless is a perfect role for Jet Li. The part asks little of his acting talents (fortunately) and much from his athletic abilities. Similarly, Donnie Yen (Blade II, Shanghai Knights) turns Sky into a man who gets right down to business, letting his sword do the talking.Hero also burns with immediacy and relevance. As China struggles with the division between Beijing and Taiwan, Zhang Yimou poses a heartfelt challenge. He acknowledges the value of unification and peace. He knows that militant resistance of the empire's progress can lead only to more violence and loss. But he reminds the viewer that the peculiarity of unique, diverse cultures produces valuable, irreplaceable rewards ... and people. It is as if the storyteller cannot find a satisfactory conclusion to his own epic.
Thus, American viewers may be unsettled by the conclusion, as there seems to be no room for democracy in Hero's paradigm. In a worldview that reveres the will of a conqueror over the will of a benevolent God, ""peace"" comes at a cost that will give no one true peace. That is why, in the end, Hero remains a conflicted, colorfully turbulent film. By the time the climactic challenge occurs, few will find themselves unmoved by the king's good intentions; but after his bloody campaigns, he is not the man who earns the title ""hero.""Seen in this light, Hero's distinct, aerobatic duels come to represent the power of art to communicate ideas across borders and languages, from common people to kings, emperors, and presidents. The story's emphasis on the art of calligraphy is connected to its exhibitions of swordsmanship-in developing an artful style of writing, Broken Sword and Flying Snow prove that the pen can indeed be mightier than the sword. This metaphor, along with the film's explorations of conscience, fidelity, trust, and responsibility, make Hero ultimately an insightful and rewarding achievement.",726,0,,0,"No reference.

The soundtrack was quite impressive, and readily brought to mind the finer moments the band Goblin had provided in their work for Dario Argento's string of 70's-80's giallo masterpieces. The production values were quite decent overall for such a film, and I loved both the premise and its execution.Annik Borel was exemplary as the ill-fated protagonist Daniela, and takes a few lessons from Linda Blair's portrayal of the possessed in 'The Exorcist' for whenever she loses control of her inhibitions and resorts to her more animalistic urges. Kudos to the filmmakers for bringing psychological issues and the effects of sexual abuse and rape to the forefront, even if it's for an 'exploitation' film.Yes, the story arc is predictable (though suspense-fully carried out), there is gratuitous sex and nudity at every conceivable moment (and a lot of inconceivable ones!), and you get that tired lie 'this is a true story--only the names have been changed', but it's as if you would think those are bad things. It was a great 79 minutes I will always fondly remember--unless I get Altzheimer's disease or something.

Before he became increasingly temperamental and left Hollywood a few years later, Maurice Tourneur made some memorable silent films. This is one of them. Lorna Doone is based on the famous 1874 novel by Richard D. Blackmore. It's probably not the greatest romance of all time as advertised, but it holds its own as a good example of silent film melodrama. Unlike many films of the era, the film is not as predictable plot-wise, the acting and cinematography are first rate, and the pacing moves well throughout the film. John Bowers stars as John Ridd a poor, working class strong man who falls for Mae Giraci as a young boy. She is kidnapped essentially and raised as a Doone. The Doones, of course, are the upper class ruffians who frequently are at odds with the John Ridds of the world. Madge Bellamy is absolutely radiant as the adult Lorna Doone, who is torn between staying with the Doones and fulfilling her royal destiny and her loyalty to her childhood love John Ridd. The film sweeps us away with its romance, creating just the right tension, although the ending is a bit unbelievable and seems out of sync with the tone of the rest of the film. Otherwise, it's a very entertaining, romantic film. Leading man John Bowers lead an almost equally melodramatic life when his career was ended by the sound era; he later committed suicide by drowning himself. *** of 4 stars.",256,0,,0,"No reference.

The dark colors in the photography and dialog fit each scene and made all the characters stand out. What was really clever was how the writer tied the different segments into finding and identifying the dead girl and how the characters were each in their own way, rather bleak and very dark ""Shakespearean"" men and women all thrown into this witch's kettle of death and tragedy.

931,301969,2001-07-02,Buddy-51,All the Pretty Horses (2000),,"If a movie could ever be used to prove the existence of entropy, `All the Pretty Horses' would definitely be it. Here is a film so devoid of energy and momentum that it seems to be not a movie at all but a succession of still images fading in and out of each other at an enervating pace. Put simply, as director, Billy Bob Thornton has made a world-class snorer out of Cormac McCarthy's best selling novel, for, indeed, rarely has an adventure story seemed so lackluster in its pacing, so inert in its narrative momentum. The characters even seem to talk in muted whispers, as if they were afraid to violate the atmosphere of profundity that surrounds the project.

All that would be fine if the film actually had something profound to say. Unfortunately, this is a pretty shallow story filled with deeper meanings hinted at but never explored and characters who are never given the screen time to grow into fully developed people in their own right. Matt Damon and Henry Thomas star as two Texas cowboys who head to Mexico looking for adventure and en route end up befriending a disturbed teenager, working as horse wranglers on a tycoon's ranch and even spending time in a Mexican penitentiary. In its bare boned outlining, this plot seems rife with possibilities. However, it is difficult to overestimate just how tediously it all plays out on screen. For one thing, the motives for many of the characters' actions remain murky at best, partly, I feel, because the authors rarely seem to know where to best concentrate their focus for maximum clarity and effect. The quirky and enigmatic teen, for instance, who has the potential to be the most interesting character in the story, disappears through large chunks of the film, so that poor-as-dirt Damon, in one of the oldest plot devices known to man, can play footsy with the tycoon's beautiful, dark-haired daughter. The movie tries to imply that the rich man feels hurt and betrayed by Damon's romancing of his daughter because he has grown so fond and trusting of the young man. Yet, we never really see that bond developing. We are simply told it exists and are expected to react accordingly.

This is the case with much of the film. Despite the movie's near-two hour running time, we never feel like we get to know or understand any of these characters. The landscapes are pretty, but the deadly pacing of the film destroys our interest even in THEM. Ultimately, the film feels unformed, as if it were nothing more than a series of unrelated incidents arbitrarily strung together in a pointless slow-moving jumble. Maybe the pretty pictures (and even the `pretty horses') and the charisma of Matt Damon will be enough to keep your interest at peak levels for the duration of the film. Just be forewarned, though: movies don't get much more soporific than `All the Pretty Horses.' My advice is to keep a pillow handy.",500,0,,0,"No reference.

Not too much though, because I still have not seen all must see movies from 2006. I guess I will have to try and catch up on them now, because man I'm glad I saw Children of Men!

Indeed a hard film to describe but I will do my best. The story takes place in the post apocalyptic future of 2027. Post apocalyptic because for nearly 30 years women have been unable to reproduce and absolutely no one can figure out why. People of the world have lost all hope and civil wars have broken out across the globe. Our protagonist is Theo (Clive Owen) a bitter depressed man with a dark past. He has accepted humanities impending doom and seems content to rot away with the rest of the world. That is until his ex-lover (Julianne Moore) gets him involved with a group of revolutionaries led by Luke whose girlfriend happens to be very pregnant. Obviously this is a huge deal and Theo has plans to escort her to the safety of a top secret scientific facility where research could supply the right people with the answers to save humanity. Unfortunately this task is made much more difficult when the whole worlds a battlefield and few people can be trusted. It sounds depressing, but ""Children of Men"" is really a hopeful and human story of triumph and sacrifice.

Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Harry Potter & the Prizoner of Azkaban), here he establishes himself as a master of his craft. The world he has created here is one of the bleakest, realistic, and fully realized universes in the medium of science fiction. He lets the action unfold using some of the most incredible camera-work I have ever seen. There is a section near the end which has Clive Owen racing through a bullet-ridden battlefield and into a bombed out building to rescue the girl. The 9 minute sequence is done without any takes and it blows my mind how Cuaron pulled it off. The action scenes are as intense and exciting as anything I have seen from a legend like Spielberg (which says a lot, he is me and Mike's favorite director.) ""Children of Men"" is a tour de force of direction.

I know what the skeptics must be thinking know. ""Don't be stupid, I only care about the story!"" Well you are in luck because Children of Men tells it really good. Clive Owen is excellent as Theo, a man who instantly gained my curiosity and sympathy. His transformation from hardened cynic to noble hero is completely believable. Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actresses and I wish she was in this more. There is also the great British actor Sir Michel Caine as Theo's old mentor. He manages to steal all the scenes he is in. The rest of the cast is very effective as well, though I have not seen many of them in other films. No problem though, it is easier to suspend disbelief and be caught up in the story that way. The acting keeps the films emotional center in place saving it from becoming a mere technical exercise. Some viewers may complain about the lack of closure involved in the end but it did not bother me at all. By the time the credits rolled I felt emotionally satisfied while still having much to think about. Like many great works of hard sci-fi, and indeed great films, ambiguity is one of its greatest strengths.

That aside, ""Children of Men"" still remains a heartfelt, unique, and thrilling cinematic experience. Bottom line: One of the best science fiction films in recent times.",620,0,,0,"No reference.

Except: the fact that they're really not all that different from the actual GGW footage on which they're based means that the futility of this kind of ""critique"" is already established; you can't use sarcasm or irony to shame a culture that doesn't really grasp or care about either (and if the point of critique *is* its own hopelessness, which is entirely possible, then Korine is trying to be too clever by half and needs to just try something else).*(Slightly) nonlinear editing and the use of repetition.* The editing is just nonlinear enough to suggest a trip or two to the art-house, but not nonlinear enough to be actually playing with the idea of narrative: it feels more like affectation than anything else. Yes, some of the uses of repeated dialogue and their juxtaposition with different material verge on the interesting... except that the ""different material"" gets sillier the longer the film goes, which robs this tactic of any potential force.*Is it hallucination or reality... and why should we care?* If the film is meant to take place in a realistic universe, it should have gone differently right from the part where a pair of 90-pound coeds try to rob a restaurant using a hammer and a toy gun, since it is spectacularly unlikely that someone in that situation doesn't call their bluff. Even if we grit our teeth and let that go as ""realism,"" as the cinema verite style it's filmed in seems to want us to, surely the same can't be managed with a final shootout that has a pair of bikini-clad college girls casually blowing away a crew of hardened gangsters. On the other hand, if we take a cue from Alien's line ""it seems like a dream"" that kicks off that final shootout and regard everything afterwards as wish-fulfilment in the style of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, then it makes for pretty dull fare as wish fulfilment. It works in the end neither as a gritty crime drama nor as a hallucinatory commentary on America's nihilistic excess.Worse is that what the film winds up delivering in the final analysis is a Slumming-From-the-Land-of-(Mostly)-White-Privilege tale, none of whose protagonists suffer any really lasting consequence or harm from the choices they make. Just as whatever ""critique"" the film was trying to make of hedonism is quickly lost in the shuffle, so to whatever ""critique"" it was attempting of its characters' world view is undermined by this.

949,1608385,2008-03-18,ThreeSadTigers,Kafka (1991),,"This is a somewhat curious film, attempting to be old-fashioned - in the sense that we have varying strands from an early-twentieth century writer, as well as setting, production design and various visual iconography - yet at the same time striving for a sense of post-modernist reinvention. So, what we end up with is a stunning, self-referential combination of the 'look' (which mixes elements of Carol Reed's The Third Man and Welles' Citizen Kane), with elements of the steam-punk sub-genre of films like Eraserhead, Brazil, Tetsuo: The Iron Man, Barton Fink, etc . The story also concerns itself with the notions of the film-noir, both in terms of characterisation, narrative tension and visual design.So, with Kafka (1991), we not only have the externally referential - of Kafka writing a story, whilst simultaneously involving himself in a real-life plot that will, in turn, become the story he is writing (The Castle) - but also the internal references to Kafka's own biographical history; from his job at the insurance company, to the difficult relationship with his father, and also his failed love affair etc. In the lead role we have one of Britain's most competent actors, Jeremy Irons, who, although never looking exactly like Kafka, does at least manage to embody the quiet, stubborn, meticulous spirit of the writer (or, at least the image that we have of him). His performance is one of complete restraint, far removed from some of his more caricatured performances of recent years, as he offers up a mirrored perspective for the audience; lingering in the background of the scene and simply reacting to what is going on around him (again, a popular device from Kafka's work).Director Steven Soderbergh compliments and visualises the screenplay by Lem Dobbs exceptionally well, drawing on the aforementioned influences in a similar, post-modernistic way to their subsequent 1999 collaboration, The Limey. Soderbergh also offers us a depiction of a crumbling Europe thrown into confusion, creating a fully functioning world, much like Ridley Scott did with Blade Runner - offering us an illustration of the past by way of the future - or a depiction of Europe in decline to rival that of Fassbinder's The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979), von Trier's Europa (1991) and Soderbergh own subsequent film, The Good German (2006). So, whereas most films are content to create, or in this case recreate, early-twentieth century iconography in which the past is as pristine and shockingly brand-new, as if it were created only a yesterday, here we get a past that is dirty, grimy, filled with smoke, fog and dust; in short... totally believable.This is a film the people expect too much coherency from; something that Soderbergh's continual mainstream success has only damaged further. As more and more cinema-goers come to adore films like Oceans 11 (2000), Traffic (2001) and Solaris (2002), they come to Kafka expecting a mainstream Hollywood thriller. Kafka couldn't be further from this. Here is an intelligent film that draws on the audience's understanding of European cinema and, to some extent, Kafka's own literary back-catalogue in order to piece together the film's central mystery. The main reference point is Kafka's book The Castle; here featured as an imposing fortress atop a shadowy hill. Inside, Kafka finds Ian Holm's mad scientist and the film switches to glorious Technicolor. There are also allusions made to The Trail, with Armin Mueller-Stahl's detective doggedly questioning Kafka's whereabouts and the integrity of his 'story' (an important factor within the film's internal struggle), as well as a direct reference to The Metamorphosis and some of the writer's more abstract shorter pieces.Soderbergh and Dobbs aren't concerned with pandering to anyone here; they allow the story to remain, much like Kafka himself, an enigma. The story grips us like film-noir should, and Soderbergh keeps us enthralled with his constantly inventive camera work. This is a perfect film that deals with notions of fact and fiction, dreams and reality. The filmmakers respect our intelligence; they understand that some question can remain unanswered and film can work better as a result of this. Whether or not you believe the story to have taken place entirely in Kafka's head (note how the last shot of the film sees Kafka at his writing desk) or whether you see it as the mirroring of fact and fiction is entirely up to you. With fine support from Theresa Russell, Jeroen Krabbé and Alec Guinness, coupled with an exotic Cliff Martinez score, what we have with Kafka is one of the best and most underrated films of the nineteen nineties.

Absolutely brilliant what is done with it. It feels like a very organic extension of the Harry Potter universe; like it has always been this way and we are peeking back in time in a fictional universe (and not like a different universe altogether, or just shameless fandom branding).However the plot leaves a lot to be desired. The ""Fantastic Beasts"" wrapper doesn't wind up nearly as exciting as the world around it. It's a very basic fetch quest type story that merely serves to introduce new characters and places and things; it also serves to dumb-down and grind the interesting stuff to a halt. The action scenes aren't great -- choppy, bad CGI, mindlessness (though not the mating dance which was a real delight) -- they go on a tad too long and don't add much overall.Rowling clearly knows what she's doing, yet for some reason resorted to a paint-by-numbers plot to get her points across. Maybe it was studio interference (albeit only for the first film, to re-introduce things in a simple way) or maybe all the good stuff is being saved for later (ugh, world-building).Sorcerer's Stone used a fairly simple plot to build a world, yet it felt like an organic extension of what we were seeing and how it was being shaped and presented to us.

959,2356194,2012-10-05,DICK STEEL,太極1：從零開始 (2012),10.0,"The first thing that'll jump out at you should you watch the trailer and promotional clips, is the steampunk influences in this martial arts film. But don't let that bother you too much because it's nothing but a large red herring, and something of a gimmick, that added a fun element to the typical story of a zero to hero, only that this Stephen Fung directed film comes in two parts, splitting it down the middle to focus on its protagonist's journey from a nobody to a somebody, surrounded by a village full of highly skilled exponents out to defend their livelihood.The plot is pretty generic and derivative, but thankfully the film has its technical department to thank for, in dressing this up really beautifully, with the story focusing on its countless of different easter eggs to bring on the laughs, or the surprises, that keep on coming in fast and furious fashion. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and has many tongue in cheek moments clearly set to lull the viewer into what would be an anime inspired presentation gone life action, and it worked incredible wonders, even though it's half a story, with the promise of more to come in the sequel (which is already primed for release later this month) for this mixed-genre film.It centers around Yang Lu Chan, played by newcomer Jayden Yuan, who himself is a former world champion in Wushu, likely to follow the footsteps of Jet Li if this film takes off at the box office, given that this is quite the showreel for the young martial artist turned action actor. His character is born with a small horn at his right temple, which is indicative that his is a life blessed with natural kung fu prowess if harnessed correctly, and destined for something great. But he ended up with the rebels fighting an ailing Qing dynasty, before having to flee to the fabled Chen Village, where he is to seek the village chief in order to be imparted a set of Tai-chi inspired martial arts, in order to control and expel the inner injuries he's sustained, threatening his life. And each time he uses his skills, the shorter his lifespan becomes, during this critical stage.But things are never made easy for the protagonist of course, and he gets bullied by Master Chen's daughter Chen Yu Niang (Angelababy), and other skilled exponents all trained in the same arts, which has been decreed never to be taught to outsiders. Most of the film deals with Yang's persistence, at times comical, in wanting to pummel his way to the village and pick up the necessary skills, made easier through his innate ability to pick up skills through observation. The real adversary comes from the external and manifold. There's Eddie Peng as Fang Zijing, a western educated man who finds no love from the Chen Village where he comes from, and is the fiancé of Yu Niang, having put in a crossroads where he's heading a project for the government in building a railway cutting right through the Village. He's slimy, and he's a cad, and it'll be interesting to see how his character develops in the next film. Then there's the threat of the Qing forces combined with the British forces who now find it lucrative to come exploit the Middle Kingdom. And if that's not all, the final scene sees two strangers at the brink of infiltrating the village, primed to lead into the next film.And let's not forget about the steampunk inspired designs of a huge railway builder, which is just the tip of the iceberg on the technical strengths that this film boasts, from visual effects, to sets, to martial arts designed none other than Sammo Hung himself. Angelababy had the stunt team to thank for looking believable as the village chief's highly skilled daughter, fighting with a degree of grace, while Tony Leung Ka Fai's role also had him work with the stunt wires to lift him up the pedestal of one of the movie's greatest combatants, and then some. The playful character introductions throughout the film is something of a highlight as well, as Stephen Fung managed to assemble a variety of legendary actors, directors, and martial arts exponents to pop up as cameo and supporting characters for a scene or two, such as Shu Qi, Andrew Lau, and even Bruce Leung, amongst others, so keep your eyes peeled.Some may dislike Tai Chi Zero for being all over the place, but that is nothing but its primary appeal, and Stephen Fung has assembled a extremely unique piece of martial arts filmmaking, dabbling into the era of silent films for flashbacks, animation for the opening credits and then some, and with a general eye, and aggressive camera work to visually spice up the narrative with a playful look and feel from first person perspectives, to anime and comic book styled fonts that appear either to move the story along, or translate sound effects into a comical visual treat.

Fantastic stories can be nice if handled well but this is as difficult as making a nice series. Especially more difficult to do in Turkey. When I first heard the news about this series, I thought that there would be artificial dialogues and lousy acting. But when I watched the trailer, my expectations were too high. It was a good trailer from what I expected. I watched all the episodes when the series came out. As of the first episode, I liked the dark atmosphere created in the series. We saw Istanbul in a way we had never seen before. When I saw the first episode, I said ""yes"", this time it happened. But unfortunately the series moved on very badly after the second episode.It is good that the story dates back to the Ottoman period, but it is bad that it is based on revenge. A girl turned into a vampire comes to Istanbul for revenge years later. I don't like this script. It's not an attractive scenario for me. I can't say that the series is good except for a few elements. I liked the environment created in the series. In accordance with a story that passes today, but goes beyond time; it is colored with sharp and bright lights and has a misty and mysterious atmosphere. In almost every scene, the use of hot and cold colors is enriched with a lot of visuals. Before I started watching the series I was nervous about the success of the visual effects, but they were quite well practiced. The technical flaws of the directory seemed to be mostly in the editing. In the transitions of the scenes, there were disjointed and confused places in the connections of events. The other thing that bothered me is the characteristics of vampires. Our native vampires are a little different from the vampires we know. The vampires have never used the speed characteristics, or that's not this the speed I understand. Unfortunately, the action scenes was very few. Vampires had a fighting scene, and I don't even want to mention it. You're expecting a big battle between vampires and hunters until you get to the last episode of the series. But there's not even one battle in the series. The final episode has been very big disappointment. Yeah well, I said now will be war. But it's not. All the vampires gave up and ran away. It's really ridiculous. I didn't think it would be so bad.I want to mention about the cast of the series. Although the dialogues are very artificial the acting was above average. Especially Birkan Sokullu was good. I think he fits the vampire role. I couldn't love Kerem Bursin. He seemed very American. He was grinning among other actors. Mia, played by Elçin Sangu, is quite cold and distant character. Apart from the main cast, there is a feeling of artificiality for all the side characters that make up both vampires and hunters. In general, I did not like the cast of the series. Vampires are not convincing. They were making strange noises I've never seen before. The hunters have not been able to catch a tremendously exaggerated and convincing tone. Also, I can say that the sex scene of Kerem Bürsin and Nilperi Sahinkaya, who is a mockery in social media, is quite surreal. Although the series initially excites us as ideas, it is a sloppy production due to the weakness of the performances and the scenario. 5/10",595,0,,0,"No reference.

It has some of the best written characters, they aren't perfect but they try their hardest to do the right thing even if it hurts the people they love. The villain is the second best superhero villain behind Heath Ledgers Joker, Wilson Fisk aka. Kingpin, he is so menacing yet sympathetic in a messed up way. People may end up rooting for the villain that's how likeable and hateable he can be. Actors all do amazing, I can go on all day about how they are perfect for their roles but I won't waste your time. The action is special, no CGI and the action is done by the actors themself most of the time with longer takes then just the typical and boring punch and cut style action. This is what made me want more action like this and less of the boring action we receive in other action or superhero movies.Season 2 has a phenomenal first half with the Punisher introduced, he is an anti-hero who has a messed up complex and tragic backstory. He really steals the show from our protagonist, he even makes our protagonist question what justice is and how it should be done. Well done and well written. The action throughout is an improvement from the first season with more and better choreographed scenes which will leave you with a grin on your face. The second half sadly is a big drop in quality, Elektra is a great addition but the Hand not so much. They are pretty generic and boring but they do give us some impressive action sequences which was great and kept me watching the second season till the end.Season 3 is the best of Daredevil. The black suit is back and Daredevil is more brutal then ever. You should watch defenders before but it isn't a must watch to get it. Kingpin is back and causing more trouble then ever which gives Daredevil a reason to end Kingpin's life. Then there is a completely new villain added which causes more trouble for Daredevil, the mentally unstable Bullseye. This show knows how to make great villains with the exception of the Hand, Bullseye easily is the most hateable villain in the show in a well written way. He feels very real like he should be for this show. The action is even better than both the first two seasons, longer cuts and more action, check out one of the season 3 action scenes and see why they are praised by many people. The final episode is fantastic, all the build up to a satisfying close, not only for the season but the entire show. They probably knew that it was going to be cancelled so I am happy they end it in a way where they could of had a new season or finished the show for good.Overall this show has a lot of highs and very few lows.

The Coen Brothers, being brought up in Minnesota, critique the Minnesota Nice nature - people with their plain and warm exterior with folksy speaking style, but not so empathetic or well-wishing from within; the characters are as cold and distant as the letters of the film title because the characters are as emotionally isolated as story's vast empty landscape. The accent and snow, the white and distant environment, all these things accentuate the feel of the living conditions and community of northern US. I can't testify to the accuracy of the time and place, but the Coens surely give us an intriguing character study.The film takes quite a few witty jabs at capitalism and consumerism; it explores people's (here, especially Americans') obsession with fast food, television and cars. The realistic dialogues and quirkiness do make the characters stand out, like all Coen Brothers films. Many might say Marge Gunderson is the only character with good morals, but she isn't as pure as she seems. Marge, though an interesting character who defies prescribed gender roles and becomes our lead protagonist (though she enters only after one-third the film), she is as emotionally distant as the rest, as evidenced from her murder-scene inspection and ending ride with one of the kidnappers. Her routine life and by-the-book procedure, combined with her husband's not-so- sophisticated paintings about ducks and the decor of their house, exemplify the fact how they are a regular couple in a consumerist web so blissfully content in their simplicity and mediocrity.Expectation vs what's given to us. From the opening title where it says that this is based on a true story and events are shown as it occurred, a certain expectation is set. The Coens take advantage of this liberty and tell the story in the most unusual but interesting way. But they subvert these expectations by slowly inserting scenes that people couldn't have known (if the events are being shown as they occurred). But this helps us understand the characters much better. (We now know that almost the entire thing is fictional, other than, maybe, the murder that inspired them.) The Coens do this throughout the film. Two other good examples come from the scene where Marge meets her Asian friend from college. Compared to the ways Asians are traditionally portrayed in films, Mike really stood out - not at all a clichéd, accented Asian guy, but an emotionally unstable lonely guy who still stays with his parents in his 30s. And the story he tells Marge about his life, we immediately lap it all up, just like Marge does, not realising that the story had the exact plot details from 'Love Story'. The Coens surely take other such jabs at American pop culture. It's not what you expect from a true-story-based crime thriller. It's not what you expect from a comedy. Coen Brother films never usually fit into a single genre, and the unusual blend of crime and humour makes the film stand out.And without Roger Deakins, the film wouldn't look the way it does. That parking lot scene has been praised and analysed to death by now. And yes, it's a spectacular shot and has so much to say. The acting from everyone in the cast is terrific, especially Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Macy gives us such a unique and memorably loathsome character - an apathetic, selfish and cowardly hypocrite, always maintaining such a cheery facade. But he represents the frustrations felt by the pawns in the capitalist system, rarely able to earn or save much to be financially or emotionally satisfied. Hence, his various schemes to collect enough money, run away and start a new comfortable life.Though just a little less than 100 minutes, the film has been assembled with such attention to detail and innovation that it can be analysed and understood in so many different ways. It's not something that seems so great in the first view itself, but the more you see it or think about it, the more it lingers in your mind. Clever to end the film with the words ""Two more months"", since we know it might be a reference to the end of winter when the snow might melt and reveal the suitcase to a passerby.",748,1,parking lot scence,1,"Reference to other reviews.  **Reason:** The review explicitly mentions that ""That parking lot scene has been praised and analysed to death by now,"" indicating awareness and reference to discussions and analyses found in other reviews (likely on platforms like IMDb).

First of all, let me confess I watched the Rifftrax version of this film. It is a bit of a strange choice for Rifftrax. This, after all, is a drama writ large. It would be like a Rifftrax of Love Story or Terms of Endearment.The next thing to unpack is Seinfeld's Bubble Boy. He haunts this movie as it was such a wonderful parody of this film and circumstance. I spent the entire movie with the phrase ""It's Moors"" stuck in my head. The third unpacking is the cast of the film. You, of course, have John Travolta in short shorts. His real life love interest Diana Hyland who was 18 years his senior, divorcing her husband and unknown to both of them was about to get a tragic fatal disease that would not be out of place in the film itself. She, in a creepish aside, plays his mother in the film. I know I know it shouldn't matter. But like the actor playing Dexter marrying the actress playing his sister it illogically just seems. well creepy. On the plus side, we have Robert Reed, Mr. Brady himself, as the father and a very young PJ Soles as one of the high school kids. Also on the plus side, this really isn't that bad a movie.

Travolta has a light touch and the film seems to do a nice job humanizing the issues at hand.

Miss Ekberg is also a statue here, towering above most of the cast except for PHILIP CAREY, the handsome male lead who shares one thing in common with Anita--he's a lifeless presence.It's hard to get involved with these characters, especially since the story itself is a murky enough affair with some psycho-babble underpinnings in the convoluted storyline. On the plus side, the B&W photography of rainswept streets and dark shadows is impressive and the production aspects aren't too shabby.GYPSY ROSE LEE manages to be lively enough as a nightclub proprietress, but her shimmy to ""Put the Blame On Mame"" is a pretty sorry attempt at the song made famous by Rita Hayworth.The story starts out on a promising note, but quickly becomes an inept psychological thriller under Gerd Oswald's routine direction and moves toward a conclusion that lacks whatever punch it might have had because much of the disclosed information was already revealed.This is an easily forgotten item that capitalizes solely on ANITA EKBERG's physical charms which are an eyeful for male fans but her acting is sub-par for a story that requires much more from an actress than mere physical presence and an overly generous bosom.

974,2009604,2010-08-22,tieman64,L'heure d'été (2008),,"""Summer Hours"" begins, appropriately, with hordes of children running joyfully through a garden. They're on a treasure hunt, following a map written in invisible ink.Director Olivier Assays then introduces us to Helene Berthier, an elderly woman whose children and grandchildren have gathered at her home in rural France. Helene was once romantically linked to a character called Paul, a now dead artist who was renowned for his paintings.Helene's home is filled with both Paul's work (a vast collection of priceless art) and more mundane personal items which nevertheless have tremendous sentimental value. One photograph, for example, features an older generation of Berthiers sitting at a table exactly as the current generation are. As the film unfolds, Assayas lays the groundwork for various heavy themes: the way what we ""treasure"" changes as we age, how art and objects tie people to the past, the relationship between art, globalisation and commerce, the seemingly arbitrary and shifting ""value"" of objects, the question of what defines art and what makes art meaningful, how spaces are ""deterritorialized"" and ""reterritorialized"" under capitalism, how objects transform as they move from space to space etc etc. You might say this is the ""rural"" version of Assayas's ""Demonlover"", ""Clean"" and ""Boarding Gate"", but whilst those films focused on the way humans are stripped, sold, traded and pushed around under techno-capitalism, ""Summer Hours"" focuses almost entirely on man's fluctuating relationship with both inanimate objects and product.Early in the film, Helene reveals the reason for calling a family assembly: she wants to discuss the fate of the family estate after her death. Frederic, Helene's eldest son, is an economist, and is the only family member who wishes (for sentimental reasons) to hold on to the estate and its artwork. Daughter Adrienne (a product designer) and younger son Jeremie (who works for a mega corporation in Shaghai) both want to sell the estate. It's of no value to them, they won't be able to visit it as they work far abroad, and it simply isn't economical to maintain. Frederic doesn't agree with them at first, but gradually the practical needs of commerce infringe on his desire to hold on to the past. Reluctantly he agrees with them. Significantly, Adrienne, the product of a system which destroys the past and sells nostalgic copies, makes tacky ceramic ornaments based on the designs of her uncle. Assayas stresses that the children are all ultra-modern bourgeois, part of a ""new France"" that is beholden to the demands of the global market and that is gradually losing ties with its traditions and heritage. Casual remarks highlight this theme: characters speaking of new companies popping up in their village, once taboo romantic relationships accepted as the norm, the fact that Adrienne lives in two of the citadels of Global Capitalism (New York and Japan), the fact that Jeremie is moving his family to China to better manage a mass production shoe factory and the mention that Jeremie's children will learn English and not speak French (thereby cutting them off from their cultural roots). Ironically, it's the one economist in the family who can't cope with the way his family, culture and historical treasure trove are being torn apart. Frederic frequently states that he believes the ""economy as a functional system"" is a myth. He recognises that economism is the new global religion, in which the world is reordered in the service of irrational and incessant growth. The dominant theology of this religion is neo-liberalism, which aims to make the whole world a single market, national boundaries no longer a factor in economic affairs. Unlike most religions, economism looks to growth for salvation, salvation being ""freedom"" from poverty and the ills that accompany it. When it is pointed out that the ""new religion"" has not in fact done much toward reducing poverty, believers are told that they must be more faithful to the precepts of the religion. Of course while the believers wait, the machine's greed outgrows the capacity of the real economy to satisfy. In response, the great centres of finance get the governments of the world to make available to them, by privatisation, all of their possessions. But still this does not suffice! How could it? Debt based Ponzi schemes cannot be satiated. And so the market becomes increasingly abstract, debts ignored or traded as ""value"" whilst virtual economies balloon to something like five times the size of the ""real"" economy. The end result is the world Assayas' characters find themselves in: groundless and always moving to keep the whole sham from collapsing.In one scene, Frederic proudly displays paintings for his children, telling them that one day the collection will be all theirs. But though his kids look up at the artwork with indifference, implying that they are ""cut off"" from the ""treasures of the past"", Assayas is careful to show that Frederic is himself deluded, unable to look upon the pictures without bias. His pleasure is clearly less about the aesthetic qualities of art/past, than it is about family legacy, memory and the continuation of a family history. His children, able to look at the paintings without bias, simply dismiss them as old-fashioned. The result is that the film manages to mourns the obliteration/repackaging of the past whilst also questioning if anything is really being lost. Does the worth of an object reside only in the historical and familial remembrances of concerned individuals?The film ends with a sequence which mirrors its first shot. Here Helene's granddaughter looks on at the abandoned family home, trying but failing to position her body such that it recreates a ""painting of the place"" that Paul once did. It's a deeply sad ending; no longer connected by shared place or possessions, the modern subject is both adrift and defined by loss. 8.9/10 – A great film, though perhaps too word oriented.",970,0,,0,"No reference.

975,1721280,2008-11-07,Pontyfract,High School Musical 3 (2008),8.0,"I regard the High School Musical series with affection - of course this is not about edgy, hard-hitting cinema, but if you want a feel-good musical with great songs and a certain kitsch element, then it delivers. Those who criticise High School Musical for being too rosy or too tween simply need to face up to the reality that this is a Disney film, and as such is going to have a very different style to Footloose or Grease.So to the third film: I think it was great. Whereas the franchise somewhat lost its way with HSM2, this latest addition is arguably better than the original. All of the actors have come a long way, but it is Zac Efron, playing Troy, who really stands out. His acting is improved, and the dancing is less awkward than was seen in the earlier movies. Opposite him, Vanessa Hudgens struggles to reach the same standard - her voice is a little too nasal and her characterisation too bland to really make the audience care about her story.The supporting cast varied in strength - the character of Sharpay Evans had very little development, and I found Ashley Tisdale's acting forced and irritating at times. However, the voice and talent of her sidekick brother - played by Lucas Grabeel - shone through. Yet again, I felt like we could have seen more of Monique Coleman and Corbin Bleu, as their stories remain a mystery.In terms of the songs, there are a couple of great numbers: the opening Now or Never is catchy and sets the tone of the movie, and whereas none of the slow numbers are especially memorable when you first leave the cinema, they do grow on you if you play them back. The Boys are Back, A Night to Remember, and I Want it All are the standout tracks for me.All in all, this third instalment more than did justice to the first film. I hope Disney leave the franchise at that, rather than trying to create an HSM4 with the new, identikit characters they introduced in this film, who left me cold. As I said, if you want edgy, adult drama then HSM3 will not be for you - but as musicals go, this is a hell of a lot of fun.",382,0,,0,"No reference.

A lot of clever practical effect work (including a huge model) went into creating the titular monster and it works well, both in the flying and the walking scenes (although the critter's consent 'roaring' detracts from the overall effect (e.g. much less effective the chittery sounds the giant ants made in ""Them"", 1954)).

After putting away a mob boss, Harry becomes a media hero. His superiors decide to take advantage of this to promote the image of the department. Harry is partnered with Al Quain and together they investigate the murder of Johnny Squares (Jim Carrey). Discovering that he was on a list called 'The Dead Pool', Harry digs deeper and discovers that the director of Squares' last film, Peter Swain (Liam Neeson), was playing the game. And that Squares' name popped up on his list. Not before long, Harry's name appears on the list.Director Buddy Van Horn, who appeared as the suicide jumper in Dirty Harry (1971), has gone for all out parody of the character. And it works. Eastwood places his tongue firmly in his cheek, and the action is staged very well. In many ways, it's like a greatest hits collection: the one liners, the 44. Magnum, the fights with superiors, the partner and the steel look.
However, the violence of the movie is more slasher movie oriented and sometimes the film becomes confused as to what it is: a parody, an action movie or a slasher movie.

985,2639633,2014-04-04,JohnWelles,The Lego Movie (2014),8.0,"""The Lego Movie"", directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is a 3D animated film that exists in a world created out of Lego. This Danish company, 65 years old, is an iconic favourite and perennial feature of the children's toy market. This might be a reason for cynicism, fears of a 100 minute advertisement perhaps well founded. However, instead, it is a clever, sly subversive comedy that keeps the innate charm of the toy, while having fun at mocking business and a consumerist society of uniformity. The animation style is slightly clunky, replicating with striking fidelity the limited articulation of the original figures and the almost stop-motion quality aesthetic of the world created. The computer generated imagery is extraordinary in mirroring the plastic blocks' texture and helping make the Lego city a wonder of imagined production design.This would all be without point though, if it were not for a very witty and humorous script, written by the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. They gleefully send-up the corporate world and the Lego brand's film tie-in ranges such as Star Wars and D.C. superheroes. They're ably abetted by a talented vocal cast, featuring Chris Pratt, Will Ferrel, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and a whole host of guest voices, from Jonah Hill to Billy Dee Williams. The jokes range from popular culture to very specific references to past Lego ranges, slapstick to in-jokes, satire to one-liners, in a melange designed to appeal to all ages. Lord and Miller know well that the finest children's movies are ones that attract adults as well, and here they achieve their goal with aplomb.Still, the film never quite avoids a sentimental, good-intentioned moral which so many films of this genre are saddled with. Its plot twist, influenced by ""The Matrix"" (1999), whilst initially surprising and amusing does eventually lose some of its ingenuity. Some of the action scenes go on far too long, excessive demonstrations of versatility that are never as fun as just the pure moments of comedy. The script eventually has to resolve the conflicts it sets up, leading to a slightly weaker second half overall.Yet this is never enough to sour ""The Lego Movie"", which, on the contrary, is mainly a delight, always funny and far cleverer than any movie based on a children's toy has any right to be.",388,0,,0,"No reference.

This is a film about two real, intelligent, attractive and sincere people who meet on a European train and agree to spend a night walking around Vienna together. What unfolds is a film so obviously important to both the actors and director, that captures the rare magic of two people falling in love.What makes this film special - aside from the beautiful shots of Vienna, and the superb acting of both Delpy and Hawke - is that it consists of a series of conversations that are interesting without being self-important. Both characters are imperfect, and have a believable mixture of realism and naivety. While the film may sound like a boring chick flick, it is anything but.Director Linklater manages to create a movie that allows viewers to feel like they are right there with Jesse and Celine, falling in love at the same time.

But overall I enjoyed it. The story was good and would compete with anything out in the theaters right now. If anything maybe it's too smart for the average moviegoer. The acting was at times pushed, although in the slower scenes it flowed fine.

I liked the idea that these angels didn't have the traditional wings and weren't all wholesome. The characters felt more human because they had to deal with their dread of being a member of this angel circle. I would recommend it for those looking for a smart,inventive movie on a tight budget.

A superb performance from Steve Carrell who in addition to being nearly unrecognizable has a very creepy screen presence throughout. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are good as well but didn't really exceed other dramas I've seen them in.The wrestling scenes looked great and you could tell they trained hard to get them looking right. This seems like a small detail but when it's done well it really adds to the immersion.There's not a lot to the story but the way its shot and the dark tone it invokes really raises it up from being a simple character study.

Are we so desperate to see men of the cloth becoming immune to bullets? When I first heard of it, I thought it was the name of one of those spoof movies you hear on The Simpson's - 'Rainier Wolfcastle is McBain in 'Bulletproof Monk'.. the Habit dies hard'.
Anyway, enough of me slagging off the title, because I can't wait to rip into this film.Bulletproof Monk is as ridiculous as the title suggests. It's plain stupid, and not even in an endearing way. I recently saw Shanghai Knights which carries similar plot-lines. I think this film is a Shanghai Knights wannabe, unfortunately though, Sean William Scott is about ten leagues below the 'funniest-guy-in-movies-right-now' Owen Wilson, and Chow Yun Fat is nothing next to Jackie Chan. Wilson and Chan had warmth and you could tell they liked each other, Shanghai Knights is a buddy movie that works. Bulletproof Monk is a classic example of one that doesn't. William Scott, so memorable as Stifler in American Pie, is lost without Jim, Nadia, Oz and the crew. His pranking around is funny for five minutes, but it quickly becomes annoying. And as for Chow Yun Fat, can we not get a guy who has a basic grasp of English? His accent was as anally painful as William Scott's jokes. Jamie King, as the token female, is quite good, but her character is confusing and her motives unclear.If this movie is meant as a 'vehicle' for these two 'stars', then the vehicle was in desperate need of assistance 15 minutes in and unfortunately no one had a AAA card. It broke down a rusted before our eyes for the next 90 minutes.On to the plot....well, we all know films like this have a thread-bare plot anyway, and this is no different. But whereas bad plots can be made good by decent acting and charming leading stars, this one isn't. It falls flat and just looks stupid.I get the impression that the film was heavily, and badly, edited. I mean, that climactic battle went way too quick, there was no tension, a load of monks strung up in some really weird underground lair ready for torture, tattoos flying around, scenes jumping from place to place...UGH! It was just horrible film making. How anyone could find enjoyment in this tripe is waaaay beyond me.A ridiculous story, poor acting and even poorer editing make this one of 2003's turkey's. Some cool fights and two or three witty lines don't save it.I give it two stars. One for the movie, and an extra for the absolutely stunningly beautiful Jamie King.",452,0,,0,"No reference.

993,1589758,2008-02-16,bludgeoner86,DOA: Dead or Alive (2006),5.0,"I didn't have high expectations going into this movie and after seeing it, it's not as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn't good either. What DOA amounts to is going through a fast paced buzzsaw full of over the top style and flash. As a video game movie they pretty much mess up a lot of things about the DOA universe but even if it weren't related to a video game this film would still be pretty lackluster.The movie begins by introducing Kasumi played by Devon Aoki. We quickly find why she didn't say anything when she played Miho in Sin City. Her acting is laughably bad. To top off this awkward introduction she leaps out of a castle and deploys a mini hang glider in a very WTF moment. She then receives a DOA invite and it recaps who she is. This trend continues for Tina, and Christie to the point it becomes monotonous So after all is said and done they take a plane to an island which they need to parachute into to participate in the DOA tournament to win ten million dollars. But all is not what it seems as a conspiracy unravels. The story is pretty sub par, and the action is over the top, not to mention there's probably a fight every two seconds.However, I will say that the film did become slightly interesting in the second half. The story, shifts focus from a DOA tournament to a rescue mission, though it might as well have been the same because they're just fighting like they always do. Mainly the characters actions and relationships that form make the film more interesting towards the end than it was at the beginning.Since this is a movie based on a video game I thought I'd compare how some of the characters in the movie compare to the game. The characters in the movie are adequately likable, but my favorite characters from the game weren't my favorite in this movie and my least favorite characters from the game became likable in the movie. I thought Kasumi wasn't anything to write home about, and even though she seemingly seems to be the main character there isn't a lot of her incorporated into the movie. Tina is OK, she's neither here nor there. Holly Valance doesn't seem right as Christie (she doesn't look good as a blonde or whatever they did with her hair) but she seems to be the main focus of the movie.Leon looks more like Bryan Fury from the Tekken series more than he does Leon from DOA. Bayman acts like a total idiot. Characters like Lei-Fang (my favorite) have a minimal role in the movie (which is OK because the actress they chose for her looks like Tengu). Also Gen-Fu and Brad Wong are in the movie for a flash second and although the credits say Hitomi is in the movie I don't recall seeing her. Hayabusa seems to fear women, but is somewhat likable. Hayate is a master of acupuncture but I never liked him in the game anyway. Bass I had no beef with but had to be in it I suppose. The film also needed to create roles for characters who aren't actually in the game like Max (lame), Weatherby (kind of liked him), and Donovan (the ultimate badass villain).I'm not a big fan of Zack in the game but he is kind of cool in this movie. He is a little humorous plus I thought he had some cool hair. The character who stole the show for me was Helena. I was never a fan of her character in the games but though she was the best in this movie. They did screw up her character by not making her French but she has enough good looks and charisma to make the film watchable. The accuracy of how the characters related to their game counterparts wasn't an issue for me. I didn't anticipate they would get something like it correct so I let the film makers have a pass on that issue.Another thing that caught my eye is the way the movie looked. The environments and sets were interesting and beautiful. The camera work and shots selection was pretty interesting. The movie is shot pretty well even if everything else in the movie is sub par It has Ultraviolet syndrome, but DOA is more enjoyable than that film. If the cinematography wasn't interesting this film would probably be a complete loss.All in all DOA is pretty ridiculous, it's not the best movie, its not the worst movie, but it is watchable... somewhat.

It tells the real-life story of Dorothy Day, who founded the ""Catholic Worker"" newspaper and relief agency for the poor in New York City during the Depression.  Moira Kelly gives a very good performance as Day.  The story follows her quest to find her way in life, ultimately leading to her helping thousands of people and providing a role model for activists.The film contains a scene where Kelly says one of the most quotable lines ever: ""If you feed the poor, you're called a saint.  If you ask why they're poor, you're called a Communist.""  Kelly says this during a scene when she is responding to people who resist her search for the truth through her newspaper.  Americans who are concerned with political freedom and justice should keep this statement in mind - it is especially salient today.That said, there are flaws in ""Entertaining Angels.""  Kelly's performance as the younger Dorothy Day is great, but in the film Day is supposed gradually to look older, and this aging process isn't convincing.  Martin Sheen also has a part as a wandering, Christ-like, populist preacher.  He's OK here, but his Inspector Clouseau-like French accent won't be on his career retrospective videotape.  Also, the film might have bitten off more than it can chew.  It could have used a bigger budget and a more professional cast.Overall, though, this one is well worth a rental.

Beautiful visuals guaranteed, but with a quite flat story.The idea of creating a new movie franchise within the universe of the classic Alien movies is genius. With Ridley directing, it certainly had all the potential of something amazing. Although wanting to create something new, rarely works when following the exact same old formula as all the other Alien movies (and every other copycat B alien movie since). For a movie that wanted to DISTANCE itself from the ""Alien prequel"" stigma, it doesn't do a very good job.The audience was laughing at the dramatic/horrific scenes because it felt too forced, and very obvious. Squid-babies and phallus-snakes might not have been the best of choices unfortunately.Still, it's worth watching as long as you don't expect something in the level with the classic Alien movie.Worst irritation: Why spend millions of dollars on creating beautiful visuals for the movie, but not bother with making a old man makeup that looks credible (or actually hiring an old guy to do the job)?",177,0,,0,"No reference.

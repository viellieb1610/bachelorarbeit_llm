0,1893220,2009-12-05,Enchorde,地心冒險 (2008),5.0,"Recap: Unsuccessful and mainly disrespected geologist Trevor Anderson is obsessed with the idea that his disappeared brother put forth. That the tectonics works in such a way that another world might exist beneath ours, just like the story Jules Verne wrote. He is so obsessed he almost forgets that he is to take care of his nephew Josh a few days, so when the two of them find an anomaly on Iceland, he got to bring Josh along. He enlists young mountain guide Hannah, but on the expedition, they become trapped in a cave. It leads further and further down and soon they find themselves on the most unbelievable adventure.Comments: Yes, it is an adventure without any comparison, but two things should be known about this movie. First off, it is a family movie. Yes, it is adventurous, but not in any really suspenseful way. More in the goofy, funny way. You should know this before you watch, because otherwise it might become annoying.Second off, it was released in a 3D-version, and the script and direction is clearly adapted to it. It is all too evident, even if you don't get the 3D-version. Some stretches of the film is far too much alike a theme park ride to be really good. But I bet it is spectacular in 3D. Apparently the original writer and director left the production in fear of the movie focusing on effects more than story. His fears proved to be well founded as the story unfortunately takes the back seat to effects far too often. As a grown-up it almost gets boring sometimes, and I guess a few kids might think so too.Surprisingly much of the CGI is of pretty poor quality. Some animals and environment is feeling too much like plastic toys, and the characters are too evidently acting before a blue screen. Sure, I know they must be, but when it looks like they were cut in like in a movies from the forties, it's bad.I didn't much appreciate the acting either, with one exception. Mostly this is due to the characters. Trevor is too goofy and clumsy, and too responsible for the comic effect. Josh suffers from movie-kid syndrome annoyingly putting himself in trouble too much. Only Anita Briem, an authentic Icelandic, as Hannah is a competent character and acts convincingly. I sincerely hopes she get better roles in the future, and returns for the planned sequel.I had hoped for more, even without any high expectations. Maybe next time they could focus more on doing the basics, like a decent story, before they concentrate on the special effects.5/10",435,0,,0,No reference

This film is a tad bit better than the previous two films due mostly to having a Western location, which adds a different touch to the typical murder mystery. Conway is more energized here and delivers a fine performance and even the supporting players are a step up from previous films with Cliff Clark stealing the show as the dimwitted but tough trying Detective. The mystery itself is pretty good with a lot of decent plot twists and even some stuff dealing with Indians who work on the ranch.",117,0,,0,No reference

Right.

Life is what happens while you're making plans and sometimes life throws a curve or two-and sometimes, life throws the baseball bat at your head. Such is the case here, in a short which starts with a morning straight out of Norman Rockwell that veers into Bosch all too quickly for the primary characters. Memorable, with images that will stick around for quite a while. I'll never see eggs, bacon or produce quite the same way again.

It actually turned out to be a good movie! I like the suspense and the horror mix along with it. I like how the story goes and the music was really cool and adds a whole lot to the composition of the movie. The actors were on top of their game and was great throughout the whole movie. The suspense kept my blood running really fast and my heart beat like crazy! The plot was amazingly unexpected. The dirty bad cops and their schemes made their investigation so believable and the way they take advantage of their job is mind-blowing. Also, the couples' house was really beautiful! The main characters were amazing in their role and they played it really well. And the antagonist was really great too! He also played the role really well. The setting was perfect for the movie. There were no times I got bored while watching Deadline. This movie proves that even with a low budget, a great movie can be produced.",189,0,,0,No reference
7,394462,2002-02-19,kinglevy,Jules and Jim (1962),6.0,"I'll warn you ahead of time, this is a bit of a spoiler.

Jules et Jim is one of the best examples of a New Wave love story. New Wave embodies the concept of a director working as an author would towards a great novel, the film is his work. Director Francois Truffaut's variety of great camera effects and subtle symbolism help to improve an otherwise bland screenplay.

The film about love and what it can do to friendships and personalities. It's a tale of three lovers set in France around World War I. Jules and Jim are best friends, Jim a Frenchman and Jules an Austrian. The pair does everything together, until they are separated by a woman named Catherine. Jules marries Catherine and buy a cottage in the country. While Jim lives his life in Paris, Jules and Catherine have a daughter and begin to raise her. The movie grows repetitive near the end, as Catherine betrays nearly every many she is with as her `love' jumps from person to person.

Following the concept of New Wave filmmaking, Truffaut truly is the auteur of the film. The screenplay, based on a novel by Henri Pierre Roché, is a basic French love story. Primarily based upon dialogue rather than actions, the story moves very slowly at times and very quickly at others. These sudden changes of pace done come without warning. There is an early scene with a Jim, Therese and Therese's steam engine trick, hinting that Jim may be spending quite a chunk of time riding on a train. Then there is the squeaky rocking chair in the cottage, representing the constant movement of Catherine and her desires. Perhaps the most memorable scene in the movie is Catherine's daring leap into a river. The scene is beautiful in terms of character development, explaining her seemingly crazy personality.

However, Truffaut's techniques are not without flaws. For example, the fate of Catherine and Jules's daughter Sabine is never explained. Sabine is a great refuge for Jim for a portion of the film, but scenes later she disappears. Near the end of the film when Catherine threatens to kill Jim, she gets a gun out of thin air. There are no gun shops around, no foreshadowing whatsoever. Perhaps this is simply Truffaut's idea of a surprise ending, but it really seems out of place from the rest of the film.

The film is quite a bit longer than it needed to be. Aside from the very end of the movie, the last hour or so grew extremely repetitive. Catherine's toying with her variety of lovers is way too extensive, almost pointless.; the men get hurt, then just keep coming back for more. This seems odd, considering earlier in the movie Catherine was described as a true woman rather than a perfect woman.

New Wave filmmaking is defined in Jules et Jim. It's described by most as poetic, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good. The creative direction makes the movie interesting at times, however the average screenplay makes it quite a boring two hours.",513,0,,0,No reference
8,2054968,2010-12-09,runamokprods,Le colonel Chabert (1994),8.0,"Wonderfully acted by Gerard Depardieu and Fanny Ardant, and beautifully shot.A man re-emerges 10 years after being declared dead in the Napoleonic wars. He wants something, but even HE doesn't seem sure what – his money his wife kept, and brought to her new marriage? Revenge on her for forgetting him? To win her back? Meanwhile, her own lawyer also takes on Chabert's side of the case, trying to broker a compromise, before word leaks out and all involved are ruined in scandal. (Fabrice Luchini is great as the lawyer who's motives are always a little mysterious). An interesting, subtle study of what's really of value in life. My only complaint is that some of the Machiavellian machinations are a little obviously played by both Ardant's character and her greedy, wormy new husband, who values a peerage over marriage, love or family. Somehow that artifice makes the film a bit less emotionally powerful than it might be. But I'd certainly see it again.",163,0,,0,No reference

A guy cheats on his girlfriend and accidentally sends the video of it to her. Him and his friends go off to her college to retrieve it. A few funny moments with the black college and the diner but over all the jokes get old quick and the banter isnt that good.

It doesn't take much time to figure out that Timothy Treadwell was an unstable personality. There was even a personal crisis mentioned, after which he found a purpose in life in living among bears. Nevertheless, i felt a heartache when watching him talking to them or explaining to the schoolchildren how meek they actually are.We may also assume that he simply had a different outlook on life. But even then you must grow up in Disneyland in order to believe that grizzly bears are man's friends. They are omnivores and prey on large mammals, when available, which the main character will discover later in the movie and pay with his life.Overall this movie is rather an MTV Jackass episode with a death wish than a serious documentary.",147,0,,0,No reference

Mangal Pandey - who? In short its just an instance of kartoos & its attached melodrama coupled with songs & mangal pandey fighting for it. The rising almost looks like a short story/chapter from a history book than an epic. One would expect more from Amir & a 4 yr production work (not to mention 1 yr post production). Songs were unnecessary & the dialogues were uninspirational too. (imagine mangal pandey shouting all to 'raise' for a war by saying ""chalo chalo"" )But yeah, Amir did an honest job & so did Toby but then history should have more drama & war & bloody gore to show an impact as powerful as it should have been. At the end of the movie I did not feel a thing for Mangal Pandey or India, perhaps this is why I couldn't appreciate the movie so well.

The young girl that was cast who goes missing was adorable, which makes her disappearance all the more distressing for the audience. The three major incidents: the disappearance (the waterfall), the affair, and the dementia add up to give the lead male a Job like experience to overcome.

I knew it would be different from the usual treatments of the legend, since it takes place in the fifth century, whereas the Camelot we have come to know and love is rooted in the fifteen century, ""when knighthood was in flower"". I figured ""King Arthur"" would be fresh, interesting and exciting. And it was ... almost.The director and screenwriter hedged their bets a little. Although the main character's real name is Lucius Artorius Castus (played by Clive Owen), he is referred to as Arthur. Guinevere and Lancelot are along for the ride, of course. Gawain and Galahad, too. Even the Round Table is thrown in for good measure. The problem is, only Arthur seems to have any real personality, any conflict or angst. Everybody else just gets swept up and along in his drama.And it's not even a personal, intimate drama. Gone is the tense love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot. What we get in its place is drama of a far more cerebral kind -- more philosophical than emotional. What motivates Arthur and his ""knights""? Longing for a home they have not seen for 15 years ... loyalty to an empire that no longer exists ... and, of all things, belief in the teachings of a heretic (Pelagius). The Rome Arthur fights is not that of the Caesars, but of the Church.I might have been more interested if the film had delved more deeply into the Pelagian heresy, but it only scratches the surface. As a result, I must confess I dozed off several times and missed several (perhaps crucial) scenes. On the whole, I felt I had wasted my time and money.I came hoping for ""one brief shining moment"".

The film had potential to be at least mediocre, but it just didn't work. The film was based around a weak, predictable plot that was filled with glaring plot-holes, and the characters and relationships were too underdeveloped to even make the film a character-driven story. Characters wander in and out of the plot without ever gathering much sympathy or hatred from audiences, and eventually it becomes difficult to care what happens to any of them. Even their dialogue is pitiful: swearing is fine in movies, but this film goes beyond overkill with its ridiculous amount of profanity, even to the point where it becomes distracting. Rather than encouraging viewers to listen for meaning in the characters' words, this film's dialogue quickly becomes a game of seeing just how many variations of the ""F word"" can be jammed into a single sentence. Just in case the film itself isn't horrible enough, the musical score is also horrendous. It has some sort of bizarre attempt at a musical motive, but it is annoyingly repetitive and changes little from scene to scene.

Halloran's neighborhood is not in Queens. He lives on the north side of Stuyvesant Street, where it intersects with E.10th Street, in the East Village. The opening corner shootout shows the shooter crossing from 10th to Stuyvesant just west of 2nd Avenue, and then turning the corner to 2nd as he continues his rampage. One of the shots in the second scene is a bit confusing as to location, as you can see Ratner's across the street and Ratner's was, I believe, located further downtown, but the famous Second Avenue Deli was in that location for years and it's possible it once was known as Ratner's. St. Mark's church figures prominently in these scenes as well.This opening sequence gives pause to those who like to think of the 1950s as a less violent time than our own.Although none of the businesses shown on this episode are still there, the buildings mercifully haven't changed very much at all. I loved looking at my recent neighborhood as it appeared in 1959! (POSSIBLE SPOILER) It is, as are most, an excellent episode of the series in its half-hour format.

31,827419,2004-09-13,entropicflan,Vanity Fair (2004),,"The vanity on display in this film is chiefly that of the director, Ms. Mira Nair, who gave us the wildly overpraised piece of pap, Monsoon Wedding. Nair either does not understand the book on which the film was based or has no respect for the author, Thackeray. A 750 page book is condensed into a 137 minutes film, and thus a major plot point occurs about every two minutes. Reese Witherspoon's Becky Sharp is a woefully unrealized character, portraying about as much depth as one would encounter in a high school play. In trying to make Sharp sympathetic, the entire point of the book is lost ( the self-serving vanity of all characters from all walks of life, including Becky Sharp). The attempts by Nair to re-interpret Thackeray from a postcolonial viewpoint are laughably half-baked, including a poorly executed pseudo Bollywood dance sequence which occurs nearly two hours into the film and has no relation to anything else that comes before. An Indian historian I talked to found Nair's view of India quite orientalist, as the director exoticizes the culture she's supposed to be championing.On the positive side there are many fine character actors on display, who for the most part are not given anything interesting to do. And the costumes are very nice.Memo to casting directors: Please do not cast Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in future films.

            I first heard about this film when it sprung out of nowhere into Jonathon Ross's 'Best Film of the Year' event at number 5. He used the words 'low-budget', and only one scene was shown, and a very badly chosen one at that. (The cafeteria scene with the brilliant Carrie-Ann-Moss) It didn't catch my attention much for these two reasons, hence it was bad marketing.            I then forgot almost instantly about it, until it then, about 6 months later it popped into the IMDB at number 12. (No mean feat when you look what it's up against!) I then saw a better trailer for it, where it showed parts of the first 'reverse scene', where the gun flies backwards into Guy Pearce's hand, and instantly wanted to see it.            I had heard that the film had gotten a limited release, and being out here in Germany, with an equally limited variety of new films, I thought I wouldn't see it for ages. The next day I noticed that my local rental store was closing down, and at my lunch break, went over there to see what was selling. Hiding in a corner towards the back, was Memento. For 20 Deutsche Mark's ! (6 pounds, 10 dollars) Of course I rushed home to grab some money, and came late back to work, but hey, once you've seen the film, and understand my position, it was worth coming late for.
            I watched it once, and was impressed with its originality, and at how clever the middle scenes were, but was somewhat dazed about the end. Only now, after a second viewing, can I say that I understood it all. I know who was good and bad, and who strayed into both categories. Only real brainboxes with IQ's higher than the length of this film would understand it all the first time. Many people will claim to have understood it as they casually walk out of the cinema, but 80% of them will be lying.             I think the point I am trying to get at, is that this is a 'MUST see twice within a month film', for the ultimate viewing pleasure.             Every scene begins a mystery, but then once it has backtracked to familiar ground there is a very strange feeling of satisfaction.
            This certainly deserves to be at number one of any top 10 list, see it now, and if you already have, you probably haven't understood it, so see it again.AND THIS ISN'T FOR ANYBODY WITH SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS THEMSELVES !",426,1,bezieht sich nicht auf bewertungen,1,Reference to other reviews
36,1955225,2010-04-19,eucalyptus9,The Lovely Bones (2009),9.0,"I'd heard the acclaim for the novel ""The Lovely Bones"" so got a hold of the book and found the first few chapters interesting and original. Before long, though, it descended into a tedious, boring narrative that eventually had me turning to the end of the book, to find one of the lamest endings to a story I'd encountered.Somehow, out of this tedium Peter Jackson has fashioned a fascinating and beautiful film. The beauty seems to come from his own visionary qualities - many of the scenes of the after life hark back to the imaginative settings he created for his early feature ""Heavenly Creatures'. He's removed some of the novel's subplots - the changing dynamics of the Salmon family with their community, and the affair between Len and Abigail, although the latter gets the merest hint, when Jack is thanking Len for his friendship, and adds, meaningfully ""And thanks for being such a good friend to Abigail."" Subtle. The film had a PG-13 rating in the US and so the rape of Susie is glossed over, but the way that Jackson conveys the horror of her murder, without melodrama and explicitness, is remarkably well done.The cast are universally good. Mark Wahlberg, who was the best thing about ""The Departed"", seems to have since embarked upon a series of shonky performances in atrociously bad films, but in this, he is again excellent. Susan Sarandon has an hilariously funny scene, and Saoirse Ronan is brilliant. She's not a classic screen beauty, but when her erstwhile boyfriend Ray says to her ""You are beautiful, Susie Salmon"", you can't help but agree. I guess that Stanloy Tucci gets the major kudos. He's unrecognisable at first, and his sinister predator is as much a landmark villain as Anthony Hopkins made of Hannibal Lecter.Like Mel Gibson, Jackson's hand as director is evident in all his films. His major flaw is a tendency to go on too damn long - The Return of the King, King Kong - and I thought this movie was heading in the same direction, but he's restrained himself here. Jackson has created a good body of work - Meet The Feebles is always worth another look - but I think that this is his finest film. 9/10",376,0,,0,No reference

They pass the time casually, not much happens. End of first half. They take some kind of drug (I assume to be acid,) they share the surreal nightmare trip. Something bad happens, one of them will not be going home, ever, they react to it in varying ways.I couldn't help but enjoy the movie, they looked like they enjoyed themselves making it and that sense of fun comes across when watching. The dialogue is so real as we are treated to awkward conversations between people who have not much in common except shared college experiences and wonderfully natural lines such as ""oh my god, I bought wigs,"" ""fantastic, tell me more,"" ""they're blonde"" which made me giggle at the audacity of the film maker. The uncomfortable silences between the girls are even more realistic and true, it is these gaps in dialogue that accentuate what the movie is; a fun yet uncomfortable film about people and the way they relate to each other.The cinematography from Daryl Pitman is superb, not just for a low budget film but for a film full stop, he uses vivid colours, a locked camera and a clean crisp use of light to highlight the overall feel of fresh playfulness and a tension that's slow to build to barely a simmer.The music and sound design has gotten a lot of play, and rightly so, it is sufficiently hip when required and noticeably helps add to the sense of impending dread after one of the girls remarks that ""things are only going to get worse."" Whilst the idea of four lesbian/bi-sexual girls drinking and having fun would ordinarily play in to male fantasies without even trying, I left Vacation! massively impressed with Zach Clark's direction and his restraint. The film studies concept of the camera gaze as male is largely thrown out of the window here as at no point did I get the sense that any of the proceedings were being eroticised, or the characters shown in an overtly sexual manner. Even the brief nudity and sexual behaviour is filmed so matter of factly that claims of misogyny would be flimsy at best.Overall this is no Gregg Arraki, there's less plot, but it is a fun and impressive piece of low budget independent non-genre film making worth watching. blahblahblahgay.blogspot",408,0,,0,No reference

It's based on the true story of Dr. Deborah Lipstadt, based on her book ""History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier."" Denial recounts Dr. Lipstadt's 1996 legal battle against David Irving. Irving accused Lipstadt of libel when she called him a Holocaust denier. In England, in cases of libel, the burden of proof is on the accused. It was up to Lipstadt and her legal team, led by Richard Rampton, to prove that Irving specifically knew he was lying in claiming the Holocaust did not occur. Denial stars Rachel Weisz as Deborah Lipstadt and Tom Wilkinson as Richard Rampton, a barrister-at-law who represented Lipstadt in court. Both of them are outstanding actors, and perform their roles superbly. However, even Weisz and Wilkinson are outshone by Timothy Spall as David Irving. You believe in Spall as a Holocaust denier--brilliant, bigoted, and brutally effective.I was amazed when an IMDb reviewer called the movie ""boring."" There was never a moment in which I was bored.

It's Steven Spielberg's third time around making ""alien"" pictures after his first attempt in the 1970's flick Close Encounters of the Third Kind (the best in my opinion) where it showed how something out of the ordinary can be something amazing to everybody. In 1982, Steven brought the ""awe"" back in movie experience by making E.T. (The Extra Terrestrial) where it showed that an unlikely bond between an alien and an outcast child. Now Steven is back but bringing more menace to his aliens than the cute creatures.Tom Cruise is Ray Ferrier, a divorce father who sees his children whenever the wife (Miranda Otto) needs something. His children are played by Justin Chatwin and the talented Dakota Fanning in which they don't seem to fond of their father once they arrive to spend the weekend with them. It's all moaning and argument until something happens in the skies leaving all of the citizens in New Jersey to wonder what's happening before an alien invasion takes place. People are being hit with laser beams and buildings being destroyed while Tom Cruise and his kids try to get away from everything as possible.It becomes too annoying when Spielberg makes too many references about 9/11 from a frame photograph of Tom Cruise's character and the family of the twin towers in the background along with the American flags we see at each house to the references of the attacks from the rubble, the destroyed planes and so forth. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress but her screaming had to make me want to get ear plugs after one too many screams made me want to hit myself with a pillow.But despite what I wrote in my last paragraph, I'm still recommending this movie as a thriller where the special effects along with the tension music from John Williams (a Spielberg regular) doesn't make this film so bad to watch.Not the best alien flick I've ever seen, but it's entertainment.",425,0,,0,No reference
46,2750936,2014-10-28,robert-temple-1,An Angel for May (2002 TV Movie),9.0,"This is a very fine British family film. Because it is British rather than American, it is not stuffed full of artificial and mawkish sentimentality, but is more effective for being 'straight up'. The central role is played by an excellent child actor named Matthew Beard (born 1989), who since then has appeared in many films and TV series, most recently playing Guy Bellingfield in the rather notorious recent film THE RIOT CLUB (2014), which parodies the Bullingdon Club at Oxford. The young girl who plays opposite Beard is played by Charlotte Wakefield (born 1990), who is also excellent. Since then she has appeared in four TV series. Angeline Ball does an excellent job of playing the highly nervy and objectionable mother of Beard and does some really good hysterical scenes. (Let's hope she does not take her work home with her.) Sturdy Tom Wilkinson is there, like an English oak, supporting the whole effort with his unflappable demeanour as a farmer who is the adoptive father of the girl. Anna Massey plays 'Rosie' and gives a marvellous professional polish to the proceedings, as she did to everything. Of all the actresses I have known, she was certainly one of the nicest and most intelligent. She was married to a delightful, gentle scientist named Uri Andres (who once astounded me by handing me a chunk of kimberlite containing diamonds), having earlier somehow survived marriage to Jeremy Brett, which was evidently not easy. (She also had sadly unsatisfactory relationships with her father and her brother, the actors Raymond Massey and Daniel Massey, so you could say she had a rough time with the male gender for much of her life.) She was a truly fascinating woman. The well-known character actress Dora Bryan has a bit part in this film, and it is a shame we see so little of her. Willard Carroll has done a very good job of directing this film. The story is a 'slip through time' one, where the little boy of today goes back to the days of World War Two and then returns much wiser. It is quite an adventure, and children will love it. The film was shot entirely on location in South Yorkshire, with much beautiful scenery. The film is entirely wholesome, and the coarsest thing in it is milking a cow.",388,0,,0,No reference

But not much. Mostly this is a breathless ode to the seductive power of luxury items and a celebration of people who need them like oxygen.

Scott's Oscar-winning portrayal dominates the film and overshadows all the other characters, much as Patton dominated those under his command in real life. There is no real attempt to create another strong character in the movie; Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is mainly used to react to Patton and the British General Montgomery is seen as a caricature, a stereotypical stuffy Brit who contrasts with Patton's earthy and impulsive nature. Scott truly becomes Patton in this film; it's difficult now to think of one without the other. The characterization and the film have many layers. On the one hand, 'Patton' is a straightforward war flick, with big, well-staged battle sequences. But it is also a brooding psychological study of a complicated individual, one who's near-madness goes hand in hand with his cunning and courage. Patton comes across as, among many things, an outsider in his own chosen field of endeavor. The other officers, including the generals who are his superiors, consider him something of a brilliant kook, to be used when needed and shunted aside when he isn't, or when he embarrasses them. Eisenhower, who is never seen or heard in the film, and his group of generals are businesslike, no-nonsense types who share none of Patton's flamboyance or showmanship. To them, the war is an ugly business to be concluded as quickly and painlessly as possible. For Patton, it is a holy, glorious crusade that defines him and his reason for being. Some critics claimed the movie was both pro-war and anti-war. I have to agree with Roger Ebert, it's no such thing; it's about as pro-war as you can get. But since its setting is World War II, that is not a difficult or far-fetched notion to accept. Even in this confused day and age where we agonize over whether conflicts are worth getting involved in, most people agree that the U.S. was on the right side in the second world war and that vanquishing Hitler and the Nazis was the right thing to do. Patton embodies that ideal and so we naturally root for him even if some of his actions and statements go against what we would do. George C. Scott so inhabits the character of Patton that it almost becomes irrelevant whether the portrayal is one-hundred per cent accurate. As war historians have pointed out, liberties are taken both with dialogue and plot points; there was no 'race' for Messina between Montgomery and Patton, there were actually two soldiers who were slapped, etc. But these easily fall into the realm of cinematic license and do nothing to detract from the essential reality Scott brings to his characterization. And it certainly says something about General Patton that the famous speech he gave in 1944 had to be toned down for a movie that was released in 1970!",479,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

Seems like a bit of a cop-out to me ""at least if the movie is no good, they'll watch for the stripping.""

54,4512477,2019-11-08,skunkworksalpha,Midway (2019),10.0,"Midway was an excellent movie that depicts the events leading up to the battle of Midway and the battle itself.
It is fairly quick paced with enough historical background character introductions to leave the viewer invested, even if we already know the outcome. The family and buddy scenes are not lengthy, and add just the right amount of the human element.
The movie covers the events from before Pearl Harbor, the attack on pearl Harbor, the US raid on the Marianas islands, Doolittle's raid, the battle of Coral Sea, the battle of Midway and the intelligence, strategy, of both the US and IJN navies. Though none of the events is overly detailed it is enough for the average historian to see all the ""easter eggs"" and the non-historian left informed and intrested.
While the movie covers a lot of historical ground it doesn't get overly detailed on each event, even the Midway battle itself. What it does do is provides the viewer the overall tension, concerns and apprehensions of the mood of he US durring this time in history.
Midway does leave out certain historical events. It didn't cover the PBYs search, the B-17 raids on the IJN carriers, it didn't include Jimmy Thatch, or the two attacks on the Yorktown in detail.
But, and I must stress this fact, what it did cover was accurate (with the exception of the US torpedo planes carrying bombs on wing hard mounts).
For the first time in a movie it covers the air raids on the IJN carriers from Midway itself, including thr B-26 Marauders, but not the TBF avengers. It included the Nautilus Gato class firing on the IJN taskforce and the reason the Japanese left behind the destroyer which was later followed by the US SBDs that led them to the IJN carries.
The CGI was adequate for visual effects, and the detail of the Yorktown class carriers and even the IJN carriers was incredibly accurate.
Midway focuses on several key individuals to be the protagonist rather than a PBS style docudrama.
Midway also pays attention to detail about the age of the sailors, the types of aircraft, and weaponry aboard ships.
Midway does feel like it needs the director's cut and would do better as a three hour movie as it felt a little rushed at times.

61,4090558,2019-03-30,MidnightSerpent,Tengen toppa gurren lagann (2007–2008),10.0,"You know that feeling of total shock and awe that you get after finishing a really good show or movie? Where you just sit there staring at the screen, unable to process the sheer epicness of what you just saw? Imagine that feeling, but ten times stronger, and you might get a taste of what I felt while watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Every time I finish that final episode, I get this euphoric feeling that lasts for several hours on end, often keeping me up the entire night on pure adrenaline. There isn't a single day that goes by where I don't have flashbacks to certain scenes from the show and start getting the chills all over again. Yes, it's that good.One of the most common misconceptions of Gurren Lagann I hear is that it's a simple, mindless show that's all about over the top fight scenes and cheesy inspirational speeches. And while the show has plenty of those, it has way more than just adrenaline rushes to offer. The story is very well written, following several intertwined character arcs and thematic ideas that all spiral around a very deep and thought provoking central message. The attention to detail is ridiculous, with extended metaphors that can be applied to almost every aspect of the show. On top of that, there are several plot twists and surprises to keep the viewer engaged. The only issue I might have with the story is with a couple episodes near the beginning, which I feel are weaker than the rest of the show, but the last few episodes more than make up for it with my favorite ending of all time.The major characters of this show are brilliantly written. Kamina's bold relentless attitude has its own charm, and Simon ""the Digger"" has one of the best character arcs I've seen in any form of media. Other characters like Yoko, Viral, Rossiu, and Lordgenome all have their own traits and well written arcs throughout the series. While their world is very different from ours, the characters feel very real and relatable through their growth. And of course, the villains are also great, with justified and believable motivations that serve as a near perfect contrast to our protagonists.The visuals are animation are outstanding in this show, especially when considering that it was made in 2007. The fights are beautifully choreographed and visually appealing with vivid color palettes. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in anime. And there's plenty of visual symbolism that adds meaning to the story and characters. The art is especially good in the final few episodes, which the creators saved 40% of their budget for. And it shows; those final episodes are some of the most beautiful episodes I've ever seen. That final fight, oh my god.The show is just as amazing in the audio department. The voice acting is powerful for both the sub and dub versions. In fact, it has one of the best dubs I've heard, right alongside Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. But where the sound truly stands out is in the music. There's a large variety of soundtracks that perfectly capture every scene, whether they're happy, sad, spine-chilling, or pure hype moments. One track in particular, titled ""Libera Me From Hell"", is the most unique and symbolic soundtrack I've ever heard. It plays during some of the best scenes in the entire show, and it makes those scenes that much better.Yeah, as you can probably tell by now, I love this show. It's my favorite piece of fiction across all types of media and storytelling, and I've had more fun watching it than anything else. Hell, those last few episodes are probably in the top ten best experiences of my life. The show's messages have genuinely made a positive impact on my life and how I view the world. And while I don't expect everyone to enjoy it as much as I do, I think anyone would be doing themselves a huge favor by watching it. So what are you waiting for? Open a new window and experience one of the most epic shows anime has to offer.",692,0,,0,No reference

He is one of the fortunate few amongst actors on whom the camera seems to linger whether or nor he is the main focus of the action.Mr Bogdanovich takes advantage of his peculiar talent when casting him as a pimp in ""St.Jack"".Pimps generally don't get good publicity,indeed I have known several and the ""nicest"" of those was wont to burn his girls with lighted cigarettes as the whim took him,his ""niceness"" being restricted to the fact that he allowed them to keep about 20% of their earnings,making him a prince amongst pimps apparently.So the good - guy pimp is as mythical a being as the tart with the heart.Any working girl ending up with a ""manager"" like Jack Flowers would consider herself in whores' heaven. Mr Gazzara's great strength is in playing characters with hidden depths and there is more to Jack than meets the eye.He is tough and he is clever and he is ambitious.Despite fierce opposition from the Chinese criminal fraternity in Singapore he opens up his own whorehouse.When pressured to use compromising photographs to blackmail an American politician he refuses to do so,thus incurring the wrath of the CIA.

Anyone who wants a reasonably decent explanation in coherent terms ought to consult the Film Guide series from Indiana University Press.It is an unforgettable movie that would not have had quite the same impact if it had been made more than one or two years, one way or the other, of 1968.Just take one instance. The computer, Hal, the most interesting character in the film, goes berserk. He signals to the two astronauts that there is a failure that must be fixed from the outside. The astronauts leave the space ship in tiny round pods. While they are gone, Hal kills all the other astronauts who are in hibernation for the long trip to Jupiter. Hal also causes a pod to kill one of the external astronauts and then refuses entry to the remaining live one, Dave (Keir Dullea).Dullea orders repeatedly, ""Open the pod bay doors, Hal."" His expression is one of vexation, as if he's having a duel of wits with a recalcitrant garage door. Finally he blasts his way into the space ship, barely surviving, then sets about destroying Hal. As he climbs a ladder to enter Hal's brain, Hal remarks soothingly, ""Dave -- I can see your really upset about this."" It's EXACTLY what Carl Rogers would have said. Hal begins to sound like a junior executive being fired. ""I know I've made some bad decisions recently. But I can assure you that I am back to normal now. Really, I am devoted to the success of this mission"" If that's supposed to be a joke, it must have worked in 1968, when we were all in the business of seeing (or being) humanistic shrinks. I'm not sure that everybody would find the humor in such a line now, in 2005, a year in which most of the USA seems to find itself adrift on Jupiter. In the end, Dullea, if that in fact is what we're looking at, finds himself alone and unborn in the shrill silence of outer space.That ""star gate"" episode -- wow! The coeval audience had a heck of a good time seeing it while stoned. Vavoom -- through an unknown universe! Into the Maelstrom. It must have been great if you'd been smoking grass. If you were tripping it might have become one of Edgar Allan Poe's worst hangovers. Just seeing it tonight took me back thirty years or so to when I was a research assistant at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute, engaged in a study of psychedelic drug use. It was perfectly legitimate, run by the psychiatrist who coined the term ""psychedelic"" and visited Aldous Huxley on his death bed, and endorsed by a former Attorney General of the United States. (By the way, has the statute of limitations run out?) We were not supposed to use drugs but one night circumstances demanded it and the next thing I knew I was wandering around a part of Manhattan I was completely unfamiliar with, the East 70s, never having gotten north of 14th Street in my youth. And -- wow -- everything was just terrible. People were walking dogs along the sidewalks and I fancied the dogs were staring at me because they knew I was a complete wreck. Well, let's skip it, except to say that what you need in a paranoid state is not the trip that Kubrick gives you, but a handle on reality. Well, I'm not sure, really. Sometimes I feel spaced out here in New Mexico where the Ice Cream trucks play ""La Cucaracha."" In the New Jersey neighborhood where I grew up they at least had the prescience to play the ""Dies Irae.""Anyway, one of the most impressive features of the film is the special effects -- all done in the 1960s before computers. They are all mechanical or photographic. No computerized graphic images like the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" or the musclebound monsters that leap around on today's screen. If you see a space ship in ""2001"", it was hand built. The FX are the pinnacle of pre-computerized FX. They're like the clipper ships of the 1850s, marvels of marine engineering, about as good as it gets, before they were replaced by steamships.I realize this is not much of a review of the movie itself, but without having looked, I imagine there must be a hundred or more so, really, why bother? Kubrick was an interesting guy. According to Kirk Douglas's revealing (and not very flattering) autobiography, ""Rag Man's Son,"" Kubrick shot ""Spartacus"" which had been written by someone on the McCarthy-style blacklist and forbidden to work in the USA. A heated discussion arose about who exactly should get the writing credit, since the actual writer's name couldn't be used. How could justice best be served. Kubrick piped up and said if you want a writer's name, use mine. I'll take the credit. As Douglas put it, ""Kubrick was a talented s***.""But -- all of that period and personal detail aside -- this film is a magnificent artifact. What an artist Kubrik was.",863,0,says he didnt look at reviews,0,No reference

But old prejudices rear their head to scupper short-lived happiness.This is a relatively prosaic outing for writer-director Kawase, a film that eschews the lyricism and frustratingly enigmatic self-orientalising tropes of Moe no Suzaku or Mogari no Mori, for a greater concern with narrative cause-and-effect. Masatoshi Nagase is suitably brooding and mysterious as the weary manager of the stall, tolerant if not indulgent of the inane chatter of schoolgirls who occupy his workplace like a clubhouse. Kirin Kiki is her usual charismatic and maverick self, managing to bring humanity and pathos to a role that could easily have been cloying and maudlin. The storyline of the older women bringing hope to a man with a crushing past works well, Tokue proving a catalyst to stop the manager going through the motions and start living again. The film also functions as an educational piece on the discrimination historically meted out to sufferers of Hansen's disease, or leprosy, in Japan. This part is less effective, following the well-worn trope of having a schoolkid come along so the adults can relate the hidden history she knows nothing about. Heavy-handed and flat, it ill-serves the narrative, and slightly trivializes an ugly but fascinating aspect of Japan's social history.Kawase does not totally leave behind her shamanistic/animistic leanings: there are the usual hand-held shots of sunlight glinting through treetops, and some cod-philosophy on the power of the moon. She hones excellent performances from Kirin and especially Nagase, whose edges seem all too brittle and authentic.

75,3759655,2018-09-19,joshuamiter,Terrifier (2016),4.0,"Before I actually begin to review this new horror film I found on Netflix let me just say that this movie is beyond gross. This film is so gross that not even myself, a huge horror fan could not even cope with, and I have seen all eight Saw films. Terrifier truly lives up to its name and the clown is genuine creepy but the thing that this film is missing is a perfect story line and less disturbing gory scenes. This film released in 2017 was picked up by Netflix a year later to hoping to traumatise its audience like the film ""IT"". However this clown film surprisingly had me running.....for the toilet. I have seen many gore films but this one tops my list, literally. You don't get as much gore in a regular movie due to MPAA concerns but this film goes way beyond. Avoid this movie if you have a very uneasy stomach.Anyways the film Terrifier takes the story of an evil and very creepy looking clown named Art who then sees some new victims and begins terrorising and torturing the poor souls. By torturing I don't mean stretching or dunking or tickling a persons feet in the stocks, I mean literal bloody torture. What I thought about this film was that it just all over the place. There were too many scenes which I thought were pointless and did not really have me paying attention to the whole plot line. Even though there were some scares and tricks up their sleeve I just think that it was not as good as the director hoped. Terrifier is truly a one of a kind film that is perfect for the people that love a good ol clown horror film and especially for those with strong stomachs and their love to see a bunch of blood and guts coming out of a person. But if the film was more properly taken seriously and given it a better story line then this film would have been perhaps one of the greatest clown films every made.

This movie was not great, let's not beat around the bush.I sat down to watch ""You're Not Alone"" from writer Andrew Wong and director Eduardo Rodriguez because the movie was labeled as a horror movie, and also because the cover/poster for the movie was actually interesting.Well, turns out that this was more of a thriller than it was a horror movie, so I was somewhat disillusioned with the movie and I felt bereft of a horror experience. I can see that IMDb also has the movie labeled as a thriller and a mystery.The storyline told in ""You're Not Alone"" was just rubbish in my opinion. Writer Andrew Wong brought nothing new to the cinema with this 2020 movie. In fact, everything that transpired in this movie had been seen before in other similar movies, so it made for a very stale movie experience, especially since the other - and older - movies fared better than this 2020 movie did.The acting in the movie was adequate. Well, it was not great, but nor were it all that bad. But taking into consideration the limitation imposed by the lack of a proper script and storyline, then I think the actors and actresses were doing adequately enough. The characters, however, well don't get your hopes up here, because they were bland, uninteresting and just too generic.In fact, as the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of 'was that really it?'. So, I can't really claim to be impressed nor overly entertained by ""You're Not Alone"".My rating of this 2020 thriller lands on a mere three out of ten stars.

Bond leaving the performance to try to assist a defector and stop an apparent KGB sniper. A kick ass fight between Green-4 and Necros (superbly played by Andreas Wisniewski, who has a most memorable, and rather funny, death scene) ; probably the sweetest Bond girl ever, Kara Milovy (played by Maryam d'Abo) My favourite aspect of this is that Timothy Dalton's Bond was a chameleon, who could pull off a number of different guises. Here, Dalton's Bond begins in paratrooper gear, and Dalton looks believable in it. Next, we see Dalton's Bond in a tuxedo at a concert hall during a recital, and Dalton looks believable in a tux. After walking to the apartment across the street from the concert hall, he closes up his jacket to conceal his white shirt, adds a pair of black gloves, and he's now in sniper gear. Dalton not only pulls off all of those appearances, but he also makes the transition from one to the next look believable. Dalton has Bond dressed casually, in a turtleneck and black leather jacket, and he looks believable in that. Toward the end of the film, Bond is in a jellaba and a turban in Afghanistan, and Dalton looks believable in that also, where a lot of others might just look silly. I cannot think of any other actor could have pulled off that many changes in one film and have it look believable. Dalton's Bond could walk into a room and blend in, whereas someone like Connery (who, if anything, was too charismatic) stand out, and will be noticed and remembered.He understood that Ian Fleming's literary character was not suave and debonair, nor was he witty and humorous. The character created by Fleming was not ""larger than life"", he could blend in to his surroundings. He was an antihero, not a suave superspy like some of Connery's films, and most of Moore films presented him. Beautifully photography in Gibraltar, (the former) Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Morocco; it also has a great theme song, which is worked into the film's primary score perfectly.Only a bit too much humour on the part of the villains (they should have been tough as nails when behind closed doors) and a slightly long run time work against this one.

This movie was announced as one of the best and funniest movies Jackie Chan had ever made. I truly hope for him that this isn't true, because this movie really was a big disappointment.I never felt like laughing while watching this movie. The only time that I had a smile on my face was with the bloopers at the end of the movie. So I don't think the title 'Comedy' is well chosen. This isn't more than an action / martial arts movie with a lot of fight scenes (too many if you ask me), an awful story, an obvious plot, bad acting and even worse dialogs. Even the style of filming wasn't to my taste... I don't like the semi-flashy, pop video-way of filming which was used from time to time to make this movie seem so much more spectacular than it really is.So far for the bad critics, what I do like about this movie is the fact that Jackie Chan did his stunts himself. All my respect for that. There aren't many actors who dare to do so, but he doesn't seem to mind a little bit of pain. The only other good thing that I can say about it is about the actresses... good choice. They don't contribute to the story, but at least they look great.I guess this is a movie that will be loved by children and all the fans of Bruce Lee and other martial arts masters. Personally I didn't like it all that much. 4/10 because of his own stunts and the pretty girls.",279,0,,0,No reference
85,1370695,2007-01-08,Jay_Exiomo,Blood Diamond (2006),7.0,"If anything, Edward Zwick's latest film ""Blood Diamond"" - yet another commentary on African turmoil, this time focusing on conflict diamonds - presents brutal facts that can make one examine his position regarding consumerism. However, Zwick and screenwriter Charles Leavitt overstate the matter by focusing on too many perspectives and the result is an unfocused narrative with a runtime that feels too long for something that could have used a few minutes less.

Set in 1999, when the Sierra Leone government was in a civil war against the insurgent Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is arrested for smuggling conflict diamonds out of the war-stricken country. Faced with the problem of having to repay Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) - the South African mercenary supposed to receive said diamonds - Archer, a white former soldier from Southern Africa (Rhodesia, particularly) finds a desperate hope in Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who he believes has found and secretly buried a hundred-karat diamond deep in the forests. Archer then enlists Vandy's help, along with Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) - an American magazine writer - in acquiring the diamond in exchange for helping the latter find his family earlier separated from him during an RUF raid in their village.

No stranger to movies tackling international conflicts, Zwick succeeds in portraying the brute exploitation of the war-torn country's citizens with graphic shots of sadist chaos reverberating throughout. While it does get a little too patronizing, the film's ambivalence towards the course it should take is its greatest fault. As such, there are times the gunfights and explosions nearly get the better of a script that otherwise feels like a standard action thriller.

Fortunately, some of the featured performances give good enough reasons for one to root for the film's characters. DiCaprio, a lock for various acting awards this season, provides nuance and credibility to his character with another solidly gritty performance. Hounsou in turn manages to garner sympathy for what could have been an archetypal role. On the other hand, Connelly doesn't generate interest as her character is barely defined and her presence is mostly inconsistent.

""Blood Diamond"" is ultimately a fairly solid film. Despite its flaws, the film has the ability to provoke anyone with the brutal nature of its theme. Well, yes, it got me into thinking at times that it could have been better but during the parts that work, it got me engaged nonetheless.",404,0,,0,No reference

98,1712556,2008-10-17,halohamish,A Time to Kill (1996),8.0,"The racial tension in a small country town is ignited when Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), a black man, shoots two white men dead as a retaliation to prejudice inflicted on his daughter. The perspective on right and wrong is a main theme throughout the film and questions every character's outlooks and morals, even among the ""good guys"". Or more to the point, whether there is, or is not, in fact, a time to kill.Not only does it ask this to the characters in the film, but it asks it to you, the viewer. It makes you ask yourself where you stand. The film raises many important issues in society, and not just among racism, but justice for that matter, and what is right and wrong, both morally and ethically. Of course though, even with all this said, the film is not unbiased. Working off the basis of most movies, there is a definitive ""good"" and ""bad"" and you know who you're cheering on and who you're not, or at least, who the writer's are and are not. Sometimes this can come across as a little simple-minded, maybe even arrogant, but the film tries its hardest to bring a point from every side. Opinions still rage among characters who are meant to be working with each other, showing the different thought process of individuals.Many see this film as heavily biased, but I can guarantee there are many respectable points brought forward by all the characters, even the ""bad guys"", that will challenge everyone. The white aren't all just black hating hicks and the black aren't all just innocent victims of racism who never inflict any themselves.Moving away from the social aspect of this film, A Time to Kill offers much in the way of acting and writing. Although I usually find Matthew McConaughey uninspiring, his performance as Jake is the best I've ever seen him hold. Jackson is superb and refreshing in a much different role than that of what he seems to be playing recently. Alongside these great performances is Sandra Bullock as aspiring lawyer, Ellen Roark, and Kevin Spacey as ""big bad wolf"" District Attorney Rufus Buckley. A Time to Kill is a work that evidences the best all these actors have to offer, or at least, did have to offer once upon a time. It shows of a better time before such actors fell into forgettable flicks such as ""Fool's Gold"" and ""21"".At the end of it all, A Time to Kill is going to conflict with many viewer's personal opinions. Not everyone is going to agree with it's outtake on what is good and bad. But you can at least give it credit for daring to raise the question and making you decide where you stand.

100,2229938,2012-01-07,achyutaghosh,"Sherlock: A Scandal in Belgravia (2012) Season 2, Episode 1",10.0,"The first season of BBC's Sherlock had ended on a cliffhanger, with a standoff between Holmes and Moriarty, but the moment they started the first episode of the second season from the same scene, yet with Bee Gees' classic and topical, in the scheme of things, ""Stayin Alive"" playing, I knew this would be a crackerjack of an episode. There was a mountain of wit, tons of excitement, laced with drama, bromance and well, well, well, some romance too from the most surprising of quarters. I love the way BBC has juxtaposed Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century, taken inspiration from his books and giving it a modern twist to come up with something that is extraordinary fun to say the least. Scandal in Belgravia picks up from the original Scandal in Bohemia, which itself being an average story holds significance because to its credit, it introduces Irene Adler, perhaps the only woman to whom Sherlock might have romantic allusions, and perhaps the only target that slipped out from Holmes- in his own words, the woman, the one that got away.So if Bohemia was about a royal blackmail plot involving some incriminating pictures, Belgravia goes a bit grander, with terrorists, CIA and some S&M being thrown in for good measure. Irene Adler is a high class dominatrix and when she comes to possess some compromising pictures of the royal family, Holmes is tasked to retrieve them. But then nothing is as simple as it looks, as Adler deftly uses her profound sexuality to befuddle Holmes, and at the same time protect herself. Lara Pulver's Adler is provocative, manipulative and supremely sexy, and she does what all the villains in the world have failed to do so far- throw Holmes off the track, by using the basest of human emotions- and yes, there is an occasional flicker of lust in our hero's eyes- he does show his human side.There is a continuous stream of humor running throughout, and much of it emanates from the banter between Holmes and Watson. And as the titular character, Benedict Cumberbatch is pure, greased lightning. He portrays Holmes like none other before, and none other will do ever after, perhaps. His version of Sherlock is snooty, not more different than an immensely talented yet petulant child, so much in need of flattery and adulation, ice cold veneer and immeasurable intellect. This guy does will never have to resort to physical action entertainment as Downey did a few weeks back, such a natural he is. Watch out for his nude sequence at Buckingham Palace, and when he deconstructs a crime scene at the bank of a river. Martin Freeman as Watson is solid, but a bit unassuming, sometimes we tend to forget he is around, such an overpowering presence Cumberbatch has as Sherlock. Every episode of Sherlock is a full fledged movie in itself, and the cinematography, technology and editing makes Sherlock outstanding- on screen texts, extreme close up shots of peoples clothes when Sherlock analyzes them gives an insight into how he makes his deductions- all these little touches add up for an enthralling finale. Sherlock the series proves that when it comes to British icons, its best left to the Brits to re-interpret them. An easy 10/10 and Steven Moffat, take a bow.

Director James Wan and friend thought up this idea and put it on paper and then put it to film in 18 days. Why can't the major part of Hollywood get it right? Anyways, this thriller is based on a somewhat serial killer who terrorizes his victims buy setting them up in some type of ""trap"" similar to ""Se7en"", but he leaves them with a small chance of survival, but with the cost of something. That's why I said a ""somewhat"" serial killer because he doesn't actually kill his victims, they mostly kill themselves. The main part of the film surrounds two victims who are chained up on the opposites sides of a bathroom and are given two hacksaws, and the hacksaws aren't meant for the chains. The one victims is given a slight advantage and has to escape and murder the other victim to save his family's lives. There are also various clues on how to get out, why they are there and a few side tracks to hide the true identity of the killer.

The film is very interesting at first, but starts to fade as the story develops as it's gets boring just watching these two guys just sit in this bathroom for an hour and a half. That is until the movie ends, which really makes the movie such a good movie. Since most good movies are sometimes soured by poor endings, this is just the opposite.

He takes another genuinely interesting premise and absolutely slaughters it on screen - and I'm not referring to the body count here.The opening ten minutes are admittedly great. Drew Barrymore reaching for the phone, only to find herself in conversation with a stalker is inspired. What a pity then about the rest of the film.Back in the mists of time when horror movies used to scare people - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, Psycho - Scream would probably have passed without notice. But since The Evil Dead, it seems you don't have to scare people anymore, you simply have to amuse them.Quite honestly, I don't care about Jason's mum, nor about Jason, nor about who was hiding behind the curtain with a machete in their hand and wearing a stocking over their head halfway through Prom Night III.The genre of horror lost its teeth some time ago. Just occasionally a modern day classic will rear its head. If you want to see real true horror, watch Wolf Creek from about 2005.For those of a less demanding taste watch this drivel, masquerading as a horror film and stuffed full of characters straight out of any number of American sitcoms. Which brings me back to my earlier point: how does Wes Craven manage to slaughter so many genuinely good ideas?I recently saw his New Nightmare aka Nightmare On Elm Street Part 7, and it was virtually identical to Scream. The same sets, the same characters, the same supposed shocks you can see coming from a mile off.

In the end, it is revealed that 95% of the movie was just Jacob's dying hallucinations, and he was still in Vietnam all along. If you have seen a movie with a twist ending before, then you should be able to figure this out pretty quickly.

Another thing that is presented as a twist is that the Americans were killing each other instead of the Viet Cong, but the first question I asked when I watched the movie was ""Why are the Americans killing each other?"". We find out that is was because the military was testing them with a psychotropic drug.

The first thing of his I saw was ""The Children"", which was excellent. However, being that he only supplied the story and did not write the screenplay or direct, his influence is hard to gauge.Next I saw ""Cherry Tree Lane"", which I do not particularly care for. I will admit that if you want a realistic story of a family being terrorized by teenagers, this is about the best job that could be done. But it is not my cup of tea, and did not leave me overly impressed.And so, I entered into ""The Cottage"" a little bit less than confident, and was immediately impressed. Williams has a phenomenal script here, seamlessly blending a crime drama, a comedy and a horror film without missing a beat. As the genres blend together or flow from one to another, it never seems forced or awkward. The success of this feat alone make the film worthwhile, as I am unable to think of any other picture that has even tried this blend.But beyond the script, the characters are excellently cast and acted (it is nice to see Andy Serkis in a human role). The special effects are well above average. The makeup is quite good.

112,1112314,2006-01-16,benjamin_lappin,Taxi (I) (1998),8.0,"Hollywood certainly does not, testament to this would be the 2004 hideous rehash involving Queen Latifa and some Swedish orientated girls performing the heist. The reason why the remake is so damned awful, is that Americans do not understand the subtlties of European humour, failing to realise that slap stick and obvious ploys to get women dressed in next to nothing do not work, nor does the ebonical slang that haunts many a film, spoken from stereotypical aggressive blacks. Anywho...I don't own many comedy films in the film collection, often the formula is repetitive, and certain films can only be endured a handful of times before coming tiresome, and placed in the back of ones collection to gather dust, to be left there until the time comes when DVD's are replaced by something else all together. Taxi, however, is a severely enjoyable romp, which I can find myself watching on a frequent basis as the film is just so damned entertaining.A Luc Besson script, but not directed by him, presents us with our two main characters, Daniel the greatest pizza delivery boy turned Taxi Driver, and Emilien the most bumbling police officer since Inspector Gadget. The humour is grand, and the difference between the two is highlighted from the very beginning. Daniel is the smooth charmer, from which the humour associated with him comes at the expense of those around him, whilst Emilien is the source of all the gags he provides due to his nature as a complete incompetent (this highlighted brilliantly in the scene where he is learning to drive). But do not let this fool you Emilien is a hard working honest man, and he is in no way handicapped, bar possibly his attempts of trying ""too"" hard.The humour is understated which truly makes this one of the greats. Everything is done so stylish and classily, there are no gigantic slapstick moments, or moments of humour based of vulgarities, the humour is exactly what humour should be, quick witted dialogue combined with precarious ""sit-com""-esque moments. The film charts the progress of these two characters as Daniel is entrapped by Emilien and ""forced"" to work for him, as Daniel and the officers he work with, engage in various plans e.g Operation Cougar in vein attempts to capture the ever elusive and so wonderfully stereotypical German Mercedes Gang (what's in a name!). So the chase is on, and using Daniels modified Peugeot they formulate a plan to trap the krauts (""damn the special franco-German relationship""). This is truly a must for any fan of cinema. On a random note, I noticed one IMDb critic commented on the futility of the ""joint-smoking"" scene with Emilien and Daniel. Obviously the lad is American as marijuana is heavily frowned upon there (but you can drive a death trap at 16), but it merely symbolises their close net relationship, and how friendship is more important to the both of them, as the police officer can over look it, and indulge in this treat with Daniel. This is a rip roaring comedy which will have you in stitches come its unexpected finale, it certainly is one of the greatest pay-offs in film history, and if you don't agree, well I guess you can just stick that in your pipe and smoke it then, can't you?!",551,1,eigentlich referenz ohne sentiment,1,Reference to other reviews

115,3142836,2016-09-08,velvetnightmare690,Nina (I) (2016),6.0,"Look this film was actually moving and hit some actually good notes. Being a fan of Nina and Zoe Saldana, this movie caught my interest. And despite the controversy, I thought I would end up disliking this movie like the Aaliyah or Whitney biopic. But this had substance, music, and felt organic. The only downfalls are 1) Zoe Saldana looks NOTHING like Nina Simone. There are rare instances in some scenes where I can see it-- But no matter how amazing of an actress Zoe Saldana is she is too thin, her skin color is shades different from how Nina's looked, and her face just a bit like a costume instead of a believable human being. It took away a significant amount of believability. This hurts me to say this, because again I love Zoe and Nina. 2) No matter how much substance this movie has, a lot of it becomes void, based on the fact that Nina's life centered around a dark black skinned woman and her struggles. Being dark skinned is a central part of Nina's being and story. It minimizes her journey to cast a light skinned actress who barely resembles her. I personally feel Whoopi Goldberg or Viola Davis would've been much more suited for this role. That would have created a much more believable on-screen illusion for me to get lost in as a viewer.

Overall. Flaws aside, this film does have a little bit of substance. It's not as bad as Lifetime's terrible attempt at the Aaliyah or Whitney movie-- but it isn't as good at 'What's Love Got to Do With It?' or 'Crazy Sexy Cool- the TLC Story'

117,3027968,2016-02-15,csfanatikdbz,Deadpool (2016),9.0,"A barrage of action and humor blend seamlessly providing an immensely entertaining experience. The story features basic themes of love and revenge, with well-paced flash-backs to the origin of Wade Wilson as he becomes Deadpool, but is refreshingly unique and original. Both in and out of costume, the star provides laughs. Deadpool is no typical movie adaptation of a comic book character; it's nowhere near family-friendly like Spiderman or The Avengers. This one is R rated and intended for mature viewers who enjoy extremely immature comedy, in addition to over the top violence. It's not for kids, except the ones with 'cool parents' of course. Director, Tim Miller, strongly impresses in his first feature film. The CGI effects are well-utilized and Deadpool's signature style of breaking the fourth wall is a frequent treat. The plot and pacing provide a steady stream of fun. The film has its clichés like any, but makes fun of them to viewers as they occur, turning anything generic into a laugh. Be prepared for a vulgar, perverted and crude humor with over-the-top violence. If nudity or sex scenes offend you, then beware. The satirical humor can be dark and twisted similar to South Park at its most extreme. Not all the comedic dialog lands flush, but the creatively colorful dialog keeps the laughs coming. Ryan Reynolds feels perfectly cast as the quick-witted anti-hero. Ed Skrein stars as the antagonist/villain, Ajax. Although the character is a prototypical British baddie, his back and forth with Reynolds is great. Actor T.J. Miller provides comedic support as the best friend, Weasle. Morena Baccarin, who plays the role of Wilson's girlfriend, Vanessa, impresses in a silly, fun role in stark contrast to her work in Homeland. As Deadpool, he has another pair of supporting characters in the form of X-Men, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The former is played by Stefan Kapicic and Greg LaSalle, who split the work between voice and physical acting. The Latter, who I'll call NTW, is Brianna Hildebrand, who pulls it off well. This movie is not for the easily offended, and not to be taken seriously. Entertainment value is what counts, and Deadpool has it in droves.

123,2391961,2012-12-20,lagudafuad,即刻救援 (I) (2008),8.0,"Taken is a cult classic with a huge following, and all this is due to its portrayal of a former CIA who was ready to do anything to get back his kidnapped daughter. The movie's intense following is due to its violent nature portrayed by Liam Neeson, as he was a James Bond, Jason Borne and Rambo all rolled up into one chasing down a group of Armenians and making them pay dearly for even thinking about taking his daughter.The film was so well received by audience that it raked in a high 200 million dollars from its 25 million dollars production cost, Luc Besson was the man behind the direction and the writing of this cult classic and he was called back to come make the sequel Taken 2, which was released in 2012.The movie is about Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), whose daughter gets kidnapped when she travels to Paris to follow U2 during their European tour. With only a picture of his daughter at the airport, the voice of the man who took her, Bryan is racing against time to save his daughter before she is shipped out of the country and not seen again.Liam Neeson's performance in this movie is what is captivating; his character's ability to keep calm and think his way through any situation is what makes Bryan Mills the wrong guy to mess with (elements of Jason Borne), he used every known way alive to track down these guys, even shooting a friend's wife just to get the man to talk. He placed himself in danger numerous times but was able to find a way out at all times making him Bond and Rambo.At the end of this movie, you will be queuing up for seconds. My favourite action scene is when Bryan corned Peter (the man who leads the kidnappers to his daughter) in a taxi in Paris and starts to punch his ribs in, giving him details of how his ribs and lungs may not survive another punch if Peter doesn't give him all the information he wants to know. Here is a DVD that i couldn't help but owning.Mind you Taken 2 was just same same, with him and wife taken now and he just having to be Bryan and he breaks free tracks down the guys again and messes them up.

Despite their really liking it, much of the film didn't seem to work for me and despite a few very nice scenes, the overall picture left me flat and a bit confused. Had the film been more of an outright comedy, I think it would have worked better for me. Instead, parts were comedic, parts were a bit dull and much of it was just inexplicable.The film is the story of a slacker who is in 9th grade and soon to take his high school exams. While we don't have these in the States, I know that in many countries this is a HUGE event--and Japanese families put a lot of pressure on their kids to get into the best schools. Despite this pressure, the kid chooses not to even try and is one of the worst kids in his class....and previous tutors were unable to get him to budge. This new one is odd...very odd. In fact, much of the time he seems to act for practically no reason and in ways you'd never expect. However, when the boy's father offers him a bonus for each ranking the kid improves, that's enough to get the odd tutor to act---occasionally slapping or threatening the boy to get results. Then, as if my magic, the boy improves (though how and this whole process seemed to come from no where) and instead of everything being wonderful, you see through the course of this film that the family is really screwed up--distant, dysfunctional and bland. So, again out the the blue, the tutor beats the snot out of all of them and leaves. Then, the mom and two sons are shown becoming sleepy and taking a nap...and so the film ends.As I said, the film has some wonderful moments--but too much of the stuff in between looks like outtakes or scenes that should have been deleted. I just kept hoping the film would get really weird or profound...but nothing. Perhaps I was hoping for the film to be like ""Tampopo"" or ""Happiness of the Katakuris"", all I know is that it left me very flat.By the way, although I did not adore the film, one thing sure struck me. The kids in the classroom were horrible--badly behaved, obnoxious and jerks. I assume this was meant as parody, as Jpaanese kids have fantastic reputations for studying and working hard...and NOT being total jerks. These kids were much, much worse behaved than any of the high and middle school kids I ever taught--and American kids are famous for being ill-behaved slackers.

After a great start (Daredevil 1, Jessica Jones 1), the franchise soon got caught up in intransparent and therefore unmotivated plotlines, dragging the interesting characters and their personal conflicts out to the point where the viewer didn't care anymore. The Punisher 2, however, makes good on that by way of three significant changes:a) The plot is simple, even though it combines two only mildly connected plotlines. Both are basic enough (revenge drama + hunter-hunted drama) so as not to get confusing, in fact, they make for a good variation and keep each other interesting.b) Simple plot allows focus on characters, especially the villain and side characters. The protagonist gets also a new sidekick, which adds comedy and believable growth to the story. The series lives off the the relationships between people, not their personal conflicts. Plus, all those relationships are relatable and well acted.c) Simple plot also gives room for efforts in storytelling. There are a lot of smaller and bigger highlights throughout the season, my personal favourite being Episode 3. The whole show is not about what is happening, but how exactly it is happening, and you can tell the creators enjoyed the production.Combine these new focuspoints with awesome action and you end up with a thoroughly enjoyable series.

I mean, someone wrote about the mental state of two girls who like to create fake 'death scenes' - oh goodness, are we going to get all politically correct here too? Who says youngsters are never morbid and fascinated by death? Sure they are, some of them. Heard of Halloween? And aren't such types often budding horror-movie-makers in the making? Best of all were the reviews complaining that werewolves don't really act this way, that they don't change this way, etc. Seriously? I mean, really, seriously? :-D I've got some news - there are no such things as a werewolves.Movie makers, authors, screenwriters, have always played with folklore characters, bending and breaking rules. Vampire movies and books are especially well known for it - think of the twinkling vampires in the Twilight saga, all living together in a designer house with not a coffin in sight. Anything goes, you know, and just because Bram Stoker had his Dracula (great book) climbing up walls and not liking stake and garlic, doesn't mean to say that all vampires are like that. Oh, I forgot, there are no such things as vampires (except vampire bats etc).Ginger Snaps is hilariously gory and fits right into the dark comedy/horror genre. It's not for the squeamish but some seem to be taking it way too seriously. There are actually some similarities to the cult horror 'Lost Boys' (a superior movie, I confess). Instead of two brothers we have two sisters, the younger looking out for the older. There's the scatty devoted mother and instead of a grandfather who pretty much lets the women around him get on with it, there is the sisters' father who pretty much lets the women around him get on with it.Ginger Snaps is not meant to be taken seriously. Really it's not. And, really, no family pets were attacked by lycanthropes in this movie, I assure you.",347,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

146,3148060,2016-09-17,ppardoematthews,Ben-Hur (2016),6.0,"The big question is, how does the 2016 version of ""Ben-Hur"" compare with its 1959 counterpart? To start with, the whole story is told in about the same duration as just Part One of the 1959 epic, so there are lots of plot and character reductions. Totally missing is Quintus Arrius, who was central to both the sea battle and for setting up Judah Ben-Hur's subsequent bid for freedom and his chariot racing career via adoption into Roman society. Someone called Quintus does crop up in a very minor role, but is probably not the same person at all. Jesus Christ's appearances, although significant, are very limited, almost to the extent of making him anonymous, so non-believers will need to dust off their family Bibles to work out what he was all about, not that you'll find any reference to Ben-Hur in either the New or Old Testaments. Little is shown of the Hur household to suggest status; they come across as fairly ordinary people, sufficiently well-to-do to maintain a family of home-helps and the odd refugee, but they don't boast quite the opulence implied in the 1959 version. However, they obviously look after their roof tiles; in fact their DIY is so good that dodgy roofing doesn't need to be featured at all in the entry to Jerusalem ""accident"". Typical of Twenty-First Century screen presentations, the plot commences with an exciting preview of the famous chariot race to get the audience's adrenalin rushing before settling down to tell the story that led up to it. Unexpectedly, more is actually shown and told of Judah's early relationship with Messala in the new version, also Judah's marriage to Esther is established early on, and Judah's mother has changed her name yet again (since the 2010 TV series). Sheik Ilderim does a very thorough job coaching Judah in the finer technicalities of chariot driving to the extent that his enthusiasm for tutoring overlaps into the race itself, nearly scuppering the whole exercise (visions of an uncontrollable football manager invading the touchline), not that Judah would have heard what was being shouted at him above the pandemonium because Bluetooth wasn't around that long ago. The chariot race of 2016 itself looks highly convincing as the cameras aren't obviously under-cranked to simulate greater speeds than the actors/stunt team were actually capable of achieving in the 1959 version without risking unnecessary casualties; also, modern CGI has done away with wobbly back-projection, and works to very good effect except for depicting the misadventures of a runaway horse. The naval scenes earlier in the story are shown almost entirely from below deck, so you can't see where the filming tank joins up with the scenic backdrop; frustratingly, during the battle you don't see much else, either. At the conclusion of the film there is an unexpected double happy-ending twist to the story – a means perhaps of opening the door for at least one obligatory sequel, if not a lengthy franchise. Maybe by then the chariots will have grown wings, and Ben-Hur will be in conflict with the Son of Smaug.The whole story whizzes along at a relentless pace, thanks to the camera being almost constantly mobile and hand-held, often very shakily regardless of the subject matter (never heard of Steadicam?), making the whole thing look as if it has been shot by an excited child who keeps looking back over his shoulder to seek his parents' approval instead of concentrating on what is actually being framed in the viewfinder. One can only surmise how vomit inducing this must look in an IMAX theatre. The high edit count makes the effort seem more like a salvage job than a work of art, and some horrendous jump cuts are employed to speed up the narrative. Worse, much of the film is shot in telescopic perspective, cramming the screen with close-ups as though intended to be shown on a small TV stuck in a corner of the living room instead of in the grandeur of a cinema. Even from the back of a standard auditorium this ""blown-up"" effect is very in-your-face, that doesn't allow the 3-D much depth opportunity except in the big action set pieces where it is given a rare chance to stretch out, and then it looks amazing.There are few big names in the leading parts, avoiding the distraction of guessing who's playing who. The main characters are well drawn with the exception of Pontius Pilate who comes over even weaker and more stupid than he may have been (possibly miscast but actually played by a very competent and normally impressive actor, so his portrayal could have been intentional). Everyone appears very natural for the times and places depicted – the men look suitably tanned and unkempt, although the principal protagonists do get a ""Toni&Guy"" makeover for their potentially terminal arena appearance; the women hardly come from a cat-walk background, yet are very charismatic. Much of the architecture is appropriately mundane except for public edifices. In contrast to the squeaky-clean Charlton Heston version, there is a true-to-life rawness here. Even the sun rarely seems to shine, and everything looks a lot greyer than in 1959 Technicolor, not that one is given much chance to admire the scenery. Has our air pollution really worsened so much in half a century?It's quite likely that people with a modicum of perception would describe this ""Ben-Hur"" as interesting, rather than notable. 2016 youngsters will surely lap it up as a yet another tour de force of crash-bang-wallop entertainment, just as the kids of 1959 enjoyed their version for its sheer majesty, a cast to die for, and the way it drew its audience into the depths of the story – and still does, many years later. Dare one surmise that by the time the current version gets issued on Blu-ray its cinema release will have been exiled into insignificance by the latest ""must-see"" attraction?",984,0,,0,No reference

(Really ""Girl loses boy"" here, as this is Lake Bell's film.) I'm not as familiar with Simon Pegg as some UK reviewers here so I didn't see him as being ""miscast"" as others have suggested. I thought he was great.It's been said before but Lake Bell nailed her accent (in my untrained American opinion) to the point I thought she had been masking it in the few other films in which I'd seen her. As I said this is her film and she is terrific.I had a quibble when I wondered why Jack would actually enter the women's toilet (which of course punched up the Sean/Nancy gag), but both Nancy and he were quite tipsy so I can accept his action there. I LOVED their reactions after that, where they each fell back in their protective shells and argued using phrases those particular characters would have probably used before. Even the silliness of Nancy running/biking back to the cantina seemed borne from hurt (and a need to show him she wasn't.) The entire second go-round in the cantina with each other and with his ex I thought was spot on, with the perfect ""closure"" punchline.Those reviewers who expected more outright comedy I can understand as there's not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, but the wry moments mixed with pathos to me struck the right chord to match these two lonely hearts. This script could even have been reworked as a straight drama with comedic elements and I think it would've been watchable. I hope that writer Tess Morris gets more opportunities, and Ben Palmer more feature directing chances, they deserve it.The only quibble other than the somewhat-over-the-top choreographed end run, which by then I was enjoying the silliness of it, was I didn't think the two characters would've waited til they were back in the train station to have the conversation that (temporarily) separated them, I think Nancy would've already invited Jack to the party by then or certainly Jack would've switched his phone on to check on the real Jessica earlier (probably when he was in the cab to the cantina racing Nancy.) I'd love to know if the writer set that up, or the director re-staged that in order to have them ironically part under the clock wherethey first met.But I didn't think of any of that til later so my wife (who loved this film too) still talks to me!",479,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

There are a lot, A LOT of missing things... but well it's acceptable in the movies. The unacceptable is to change the whole story, landscapes, characters, etc.

Another point to reconsider seriously are the special effects... in Russia there are a lot of talented people to do something on the Hollywood level, and in this movie they should do a better effort.

Fights... It's disgusting to see people fighting in this movie. I like all kinds of fights without fire arms, there are a lot of movies with good fights out there. Good moves, synchronized and fluent... here you'll find a lot of changing very fast bad pictures.

There is magic in the book, but NOT so absurd magic like in the movie. The wing of the bat is healed with magic... so what for the needles was bought?

The good includes a beautiful, more modern aesthetic (compared to the previous Spider-Man films), a for the most part very good cast, and an admirable effort to build more technical/""realistic"" explanation into the back story. That being said, to me it fails as a reboot because far too much of it feels both highly derivative of, and sadly inferior to, last decade's Spider-Man 1 and 2. When rebooting a franchise, the last thing that you want the audience to be thinking as they watch the film is, ""this is really a lot like the other version, but not really as good."" That thought went through my mind multiple times. The other problem, which is sort of the same problem, is that the villain was just not convincing. Too clichéd, again too derivative of both Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, without being nearly as well fleshed out or understandable, and thus not nearly as truly menacing. Also, the villain's form, literally, did not make sense. I will not spoil that, but the character's visual design is incongruous, which make him harder to buy into. The exposition was lacking in some other key areas, as well. I will say that the cast was terrific, in particular Emma Stone, Sally Field and Martin Sheen, in addition to Andy Garfield. It is saying something that they fully atone for the absence of the much-beloved Toby and Kirsten. The Spidey costume is awesome as well.

It was one of those books that when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. In most cases the book is going to be better than the actual movie, and the reason why is the book goes into much more detail about his life story than the movie. Obviously the movie can't show every event, otherwise its going to be a ten hour movie.Being a Die-hard Micky Ward fan, it was somewhat unussual watching someone else play him, and I had a hard time getting used to that. Saying that, I wasn't disappointed when I watched the movie. I thought Christian Bale did an excellent job in portraying Ward's half brother DickEklund, and Mark Walhberg was very convincing playing Micky. I didn't like how Ward's sisters were depicted. They were portrayed as being somewhat homely, unattractive and they didn't have any dialogue. Its almost like they were part of a posse. In reality, some of Wards sister's are very pretty.The fight scenes were pretty good, although I thought they should have shown the Ward - Green fight which was the Friday Night Fight on ESPN. I thought that was the fight that actually turned the corner for Micky. The way in which Micky was able to come back and stop Reggie Green put Micky into prime time, and Reggie Green into retirement.I would have liked to seen the Ward Gatti trilogy, but I believe they may save that for ""The Fighter II"".All in all, I enjoyed it. Micky Ward was definitely a blue collar fighter, and he gave it everything he got, he earned every penny he made and he was a true fan's fighter.

157,1714530,2008-10-22,gentendo,The Painted Veil (2006),10.0,"One particular scene in The Painted Veil that functions as a raissoneur (moment or speech that represents the author's point-of-view) is when Norton offers to buy Watts some flowers at a local town nursery. She bleakly responds, ""Why would you want to buy something that's going to die the following week?"" Feeling somewhat rejected, Norton shyly replies, ""I thought it would be a nice idea."" The environment and exchange of dialogue here is extremely important because it helps create the rest of the story's subtext, and so the author's point-of-view. The subtext revealed in this scene asks a certain philosophical question: Why should anyone fight for anything knowing that death is inevitable? The author seems to suggest that unless this question is answered, major social epidemics will occur.One epidemic depicted in this story is unhappiness. Both Norton and Watts play characters that embody this social plague as types of the many who also suffer with the same. Their unhappiness comes as a result of struggling to answer the author's question.Watts desires adventure, romance and overall life fulfillment, and yet her internal battle becomes: ""Why should I fight to save my decaying marriage when my unhappiness is obviously caused by my negligent and unsatisfying husband?"" Unsure of how to answer, she behaves immorally through a passionate love-affair in order to justify her ill feelings. She is flawed by her actions, however, because she does not ultimately gain what she wants. She gains a transitory romance at the cost of giving birth to another social epidemic: spousal infidelity. With Watts' character, the author seems to be doing two things: 1). Making a commentary on how unhappy married couples are more susceptible of infidelity than happy ones; 2). Illustrates that unless we fight to sustain what's most important in life, there's no purpose to even live.Norton, on the other hand, wants to maintain his noble profession and satisfy others with what he knows, yet does so at the cost of isolating the one closest to himhis wife. He lives in a self-absorbed bubble, tries his best to please others, but is awkward and often holds grudges. His selfishness causes his wife to lose her marital stamina, and when she commits adultery, he introduces another social epidemic: non-forgiveness. His refusal to forgive her causes him deep pain and unhappiness; his internal question becomes: ""Why should I forgive her for such cruel and intolerable behavior?"" The author uses Norton's character as an opportunity for viewers to reflect within themselves: ""Am I truly happier when I hold grudges?"" Through the course of the story, however, both characters recognize that they relied far too much upon the other for their happiness. They were both being selfish. It is not until they go to China to fight the cholera epidemic that their marital issues become slowly resolved. The reason is because they no longer concentrate on their own lives, but on the lives of those dying around them. Their nobility shines in the face of adversity; she joins the nun's convent to help raise orphans, he saves the town's water supply and many ill-stricken citizens. The scenario posed from the beginning at the flower shop comes full circle at the end: Watts' attitude towards buying flowers changesshe now wants to buy them despite knowing their corruptibility. It's as if the author was suggesting the familiar credo all along, ""It is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all."" We fight for life because we love to live.",584,0,,0,No reference

Home Video put out a batch of videotapes featuring episodes of assorted archive television series under the collective title of 'T.V. Heaven' ( pinched from a Channel 4 series ). Alongside old favourites like 'The Saint' and 'Randall & Hopkirk ( Deceased )', there were a few lesser-known shows, such as 'Seaway', 'Father Brown', and 'Spyder's Web'. I recalled the latter when it was first transmitted on I.T.V. back in 1972. The episode chosen to represent the Richard Harris-created spy series was Roy Clarke's 'Romance On Wheels'. The Web investigates the activities of a London-based company known as 'Romance On Wheels', a combined dating agency and travel agent. Single people can take a holiday and ( hopefully ) pair off with one another. 'Clive Hawksworth' ( Anthony Ainley ) joins the latest batch of clients, posing under the name 'Wormley'. 'Lottie Dean' ( Patricia Cutts ) is with him too, as a loud and lusty divorcée ( not too far removed from the real Lottie, in other words ). The trip ventures behind the Iron Curtain, where they meet the sinister 'Grovnik' ( Peter Sallis, who would reunite shortly with Roy Clarke for 'Last Of The Summer Wine' ). The clients are being murdered and their identities given to enemy agents, who then fly back to England to inveigle themselves into society.'Spyder's Web' was a comedy spy thriller in the mould of 'The Avengers'. Though lacking that filmed programme's gloss and charm, it got by on the strength of its scripts - some top writers, such as Robert Holmes, Alfred Shaughnessy and Marc Brandel, worked on the show - and the performances of the cast. Cutts and Ainley are an odd couple alright; he is British and reserved, while she is raucous and ribald. In supporting roles are lovely Veronica Carlson and the late Roger Lloyd Pack. 'Romance on Wheels' was a good choice to represent the show as it has witty lines and nice guest stars, particularly Carolyn Jones ( 'Crossroads' fans will remember her as 'Sharon Metcalfe' ) and Mollie Maureen. Sallis' 'Grovnik' steals the show. I was disappointed when more 'Spyder' episodes failed to appear in the 90's.

Dreadlocked, handsome Orfeu, who has achieved local fame through the success of his shows at the Sambadrome faces the usual pressures of a celebrity who comes from poor beginnings.  He chooses to remain living in the favela, he claims, to show the youth that there is more than one way to success, the other way being that of his 'almost brother', Lucinho, a psychotic gang leader who reigns over the 'hood with drugs and terror.  When beautiful, otherworldly Eurydice arrives in the rough-hewn streets to visit a distant aunt she captures Orfeu's heart, much to the disdain of the local women, most of whom have some claim on him, whether real or imagined.

First off the visuals are excellent the visuals are truly some of the best.The look of explosions and battle worn areas in the middle east is intense.It's great to just look around(when your not getting shot at) and realize the scope of how much work was put into the game to make it look so good.The sound is great its like they went onto an actual battlefield and recorded everything.Explosions and gunshots sound just so great its probably as best there gonna get for the moment.Voice acting was great the actors did a stand up job sounding like the characters they were.It's always great when a voice actor does a great job and makes the character more believable.Game play is the best Call of Duty game play ever.Nothing was wrong with it unlike Call of Duty 3 which seemed to have physics to have problems as often id get stuck on a tire.Coming off that note the physics and frame rate are excellent and hardly ever falter.The controls in this game were tight and easy to learn.This COD game perfected the throw back grenade function which was first introduced in COD3.The use of a knife as a melee attack was also entertaining and to me was more believable then beating a man to death with a rifle butt.Guns seemed to be as strong as they should be and fired like they should.For once a storyline was attempted that didn't all but just make you want to skip the cut scenes as it was interesting and could draw you in.The one thing i wished there was more of was guns. There are a lot of guns there but there all kind of obvious that they would be there for example there were just about 2 million times i could of used an AK-47 i know its one of the most mass produced guns in the world but add more variety come on. Also many times i found myself forced to use an m4 assault carbine and had few chances to use an m-16 which i believe is a better gun.I found it a little odd the British S.A.S. was using the m4 and not the standard British rifle the L85 which was a gun i was really hoping to see.(I only have this problem with the campaign.) Multiplayer leaves nothing to be desired.The multiplayer is excellent its easy to just jump in and play the game and actually be good at it.There is a good variety of weapons on multiplayer and some customization to be done to the weapons.Plenty of match types that people could want or need.All around Call of Duty is the best war game i have ever played and I've played enough of them.I own it for the ps3 and have not experienced many problems with it.Best war game out there and best COD of the series.,499,0,,0,No reference

169,970254,2005-06-10,Theo Robertson,The Defenders: Taking the First (1998 TV Movie),4.0,"I've never thought much of THE DEFENDERS TVMs mainly because of the liberal do gooder subtext that bashes the audience over the head at every single opportunity so when the teleplay started I instantly knew where it was going . A right wing rabble rouser called John Walker stands on campus calling for Americans to take back their country . A lone Latino protester heckles Mr right wing guy and on the way home he bumps into some of the rabble rouser's vanguard .!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! As I said I knew where this was going . The Latino defends himself against the bad guys and finds himself on a murder charge but this doesn't happen as the Latino is beaten to death , so I guess credit where it's due since this plot twist surprised me and we see Preston and Preston , who if you've seen previous TVMs in THE DEFENDERS series will know are bleeding heart liberals , having to defend a misguided teenager up on a racist murder charge . So far so good and if the story continued in this vein it would certainly have been very interesting for this viewer . Unfortunately this is skated over very briefly and the story once again becomes a liberal crusade against conservative values I don't want to give the impression that it's because of politics that I disliked TAKING THE FIRST but as with the previous TVMs in the series we're not exactly asked to be impartial as to who the good guys and bad guys are . Can't the audience make up their own minds ? The rather polemical scripting doesn't allow the audience to think for themselves which is slightly insulting . But it's with the rather dubious legal arguments that the main problem lies - If someone makes a rather extreme speech and them someone decides to further a vaguely similar cause through violence does this mean the person making the speech is responsible ? Highly unlikely and the arguments put forward are badly explored too I would say that THE DEFENDERS: TAKING THE FIRST is probably the best in the series but considering the very low marks I gave the previous two TVMs that's not much of a compliment and this ( Final ? ) story in the series suffers from all the problems like highly unlikely legal arguments and too much liberal politics as the other stories that preceded it",408,0,,0,No reference

This movie did justice to the concept of family by adding a few laughs here and there and even memorable lines that still give me chuckles. The chemistry between Vanessa (elllen page) and chuck (thomas Haden church) provided seamless foundation that did not make this movie lag. However, I am still questioning on Sara Jessica parker, who I thought provided for the awkwardness of the movie. Parker and Quad had an oddball chemistry that made several scenes actually boring and dragging.

It's the story of Henry Hill, from the day he decided he wanted to be a gangster until the day he joined the Witness Protection Program.   All along the movie, he sticks with crazy Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and living-mob-legend, Jimmy Conway (De Niro) as they work for Paulie (Paul Sorvino).  All goes well for Henry until he starts cheating on his wife and then gets sent to jail.  The scenes in the jail where you see where wiseguys live apart from the rest of the prisoners are excellent (especially when Henry describes diner in jail).  As good as Liotta, Bracco , De Niro, and Sorvino are though, it's Joe Pesci who rules this movie.  His incarnation of the crazy, cowboy-like, short-tempered Tommy De Vito, he is excellent and it's understandable that he won the Oscar for best supporting-actor (he also supplies a lot of the laughs).

With nowhere else to go, he makes his way back home to Queens where he has not been since his father's death many, many years before. He has barely spoken with his mother in the interim and now he overstates his role with the band to her - manager, writer, producer, etc. He tries to collect himself to deal with this massive setback, but he is not making the situation any better with angry calls to the band's actual manager.I think that roadie is one of the coolest jobs in the world next to rock star and Jimmy does as well. I, too, would have major problems dealing with his rude awakening after so many years and the loss of his livelihood and dream.Out for some butter for his Mom's famous tuna melts, Jimmy runs into a high school classmate who is and was quite a butt-head who is now married to Jimmy's first love, Nikki. Jimmy and Nikki wind up back in his boyhood room which is untouched by time and looks like a ""rock and roll museum"" according to Nikki.Out of his vinyl record collection, Nikki pulls out Ratcity In Blue by, local 70s favorites, the Good Rats and they listen to a couple of tracks. This brings back memories of seeing the band every Saturday night with their friend Steph - who passed away unbeknownst to Jimmy.This movie is about real people, with lots of issues, who love music and are dealing with some very real problems. If you enjoy music, have been on the road with a band or thought about doing so (one of my life's regrets is turning down an offer to be a roadie) you will really like this movie.Full disclosure - I also own this ""original"" album with the cool pizza sleeve art, am a huge Good Rats fan and may have seen Steph, Nikki and Jimmy at one of those Saturday night shows back in the day.

Friends shows six roommates sharing a luxury apartment all with fantastic jobs. Joey is an Actor for god sake. Del is a fly pitcher.

As a casual sci-fi fan, I have to say that I get excited when good sci-fi comes around. I first heard about Serenity 4 or 5 months ago when I saw the teaser trailer, and from then on, I was intrigued. I managed to get my hands on the Firefly episodes, and I watched each one of them, simply in awe of the world that was created, but more specifically the characters. I've seen Serenity twice now. I have not stopped thinking about it since. Its the best kind of film experience...one that hits you emotionally, and yet entertains you at the same time. Having been a Firefly fan, I do have a little bit of a bias, and certainly many of the character moments were much more impacting, simply because of my previous knowledge, but don't let this stop you from seeing this amazing piece of sci-fi. Joss Whedon has done something fantastic by not letting special effects cloud the story. Story and characters are top notch, taking well known clichés, but making them unusual despite that fact. The action is intense and unrelenting, with hardly a moment to breathe in the films climactic moments. The film deserves a 10 out of 10 because of its daring, and its success on almost all fronts. Its not a perfect film, don't get me wrong, but it is leaps and bounds above anything else this genre has produced in the past 20 or so years. It deserves high marks, simply for its gumption. See this movie. The success of this film will inspire others to think above and beyond the visual effects and create engaging characters. And also, it'll get us a sequel!

178,1347217,2006-12-09,hankhanks12345,Pearl Harbor (2001),1.0,"Let me explain what I mean when I say that this movie is shameful crap.

First, the crap part. It's pretty obvious in watching this that the screenplay is junk the director doesn't know how to direct actors at all, and as a result the acting is terrible too. It brings new meaning to the word ""trite."" There are a few scenes that look good on the screen, such as the part with the Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball and the like. Never mind that there probably weren't many kids playing baseball first thing in the morning on Sunday, but whatever, the image was at least striking. I'll give it that. It can't really make up for the junky love story, however.

Now, why I use the word shameful. This isn't some fictional event, it was an actual event in relatively recent history (in the grand scheme of things) in which quite a few people actually died. Not only that, but it started in motion a chain of events that was very serious, resulted in a tremendous amount of sacrifice, and should be treated with at least some respect. It deserves better than a crap-o treatment by Michael Bay, the king of schlocky movies.

180,3008120,2016-01-12,alindsay-al,Woman in Gold (2015),6.0,"I was interested in seeing this film because of the talent involved and the subject matter and this is an alright manager. The premise of the film sees a woman and a young lawyer attempt to retrieve a piece of stolen art from the Austrian government. Helen mirren is obviously one of the most iconic actresses ever and she is great in this film. She had allot of depth to her character and you really do care about her character in this film as she truly tries to do whats right. Ryan reynolds was really really good in this film and delivered a very surprising performance. He was funny but he was a complex character that definitely had dramatic qualities to him. Daniel bruhl and katie holmes are both good additions to this film even though there not in the film that much. The story of mirrens battle is interesting and as the film progresses it becomes more emotionally investing to both reynolds character and the audience. However, this film has allot of flashbacks that really just didn't do anything for me and I feel like they were just in there to extend the run time of the film. The script had some good emotional moments and some well placed humour but I do feel like it was missing more power scenes and the flashbacks didn't have very interesting dialogue at all. The style of this film is its biggest weakness, I know this film is based on a true story but the pacing is a big issue. It moves at breakneck speed at the beginning and slows down for the remainder of the film, hardly hitting the high heights that I wanted.

182,2563551,2013-11-22,chaos-rampant,Silent Light (2007),,"I urge readers to watch this. The story is touching and human. A family man who is seized by a new inexplicable love that tells him the old love, what he used to think as love, was merely peace and habit, and yet he can't be sure. Is the new one merely passion? Does he have a right to betray the trust? Deny himself happiness? It is the most profoundly troubling question that I imagine can arise in a lifetime.The film is merely one possible outcome, how making a choice can upset the whole universe, the question itself is much more difficult and deep. If you're 18 the gravity of it might not register, you still have second and third chances ahead of you. But after a certain age, I imagine it becomes entirely cosmic, entirely about choosing the last person you're going to know and love. My only quibble about this is the stifled Germanic presence all through the film. I'm talking about the deliberately inexpressive faces, pauses and careful poses, people arranged in symmetries around objects, none of which is artful in my world. Well art can be anything so it is not that so much as choosing the world you're going to live in and I'll have none of that stylized pouting in my home, suffering can never be an aesthetic.Yet in this hard shell there is a softly pounding heart of beauty.One is how this harsh German presence is softened by the afterglow of a sweeter sun and rolling Mexican landscape, which is where the film takes place. Mellowed in this way it brings to the fore a quality I admire in Protestants: simple lives, joy in austerity and nonattachment. Though it came from historical necessity, it's still the closest thing to Zen we've known in Europe.The other thing is even simpler yet that much more beautiful. The film is shot in long quiet sweeps of ordinary nothing, those who keep in touch know I am frequently vexed by this technique because it so often becomes merely about style instead of sculpted insight, a garment worn a certain way. Transcendent vision in film, which is at its most powerful, is about unconcealing a fuller sense of world, broader horizons. It cannot be a proclamation of love but a gesture that embodies what it means to; words are just too easy and cheap, whereas the visible action is itself the commitment.Here we have something that is elegant and simple in just the right measure.In the story we have new love that extends from the old, a new feeling, new beginnings one after the other, not always the one desired or anticipated. All through the film we have a dozen or so subtle metaphors about just this feeling of unconcealing a new world, of reaching an end which is only the start of the next landscape.My favorite are the following two. A combine threshes a wheatfield, a violent, clustered image of uprooting, only to arrive at the end of the field at an open horizon of fields. And even greater, during the river scene, the man and soon-to-be betrayed wife embrace as their children wash below, still close, their bodies leave the frame and we're left for several lingering moments in the hazy unfocused space of their absence, only for the camera to slowly find and focus on a blossoming flower.Breathtaking!So when she departs in the end and miraculously comes to again, it the same inner blossom from nothing, call it a sense of the mother still being in the world. The world does not end so long as we keep this anticipation of presence, fields to see after this one, new people to love, never bogged down by loss. The hazy landscape of seeming nothingness already contains the flower, in that scene it is neither there as we don't see it nor not there as it is there to be found, and this all has its meditative sense. I'm glad for this film. From now on, whenever it happens that I have to try and illustrate the Buddhist notion of emptiness, or shunyata, I will reach for this one scene.Something to meditate upon.",696,0,,0,No reference

Political opinions don't appear in my reviews very often, but I can't help wonder if many of those opposing 'Death with Dignity' might feel differently if they found themselves in Anna's situation. The film opens with her in a doctor's office obviously receiving the most dreaded of news. The camera remains on her face. There is no dialogue, only her last moment gasp before we move to the opening credits.Anna Camp (""True Blood"") stars as Anna, diagnosed with terminal cancer. She has explored every possible treatment, including those in the experimental stage. Since none are an option for her, she has decided to move back to Oregon, where death with dignity is an option. She shows up unannounced on the front porch of her younger brother Michael's (Steven Strait) house. The two haven't seen each other in many years - not since their father kicked her out for being a lesbian. The father is now deceased and his ashes are in a file box in Michael's spare room.The once close siblings re-connect quickly as the pain of the past is released. They laugh, reminisce and get caught up. Michael works in IT, and Anna is an established artist in Salt Lake City, where she's a homeowner with her partner Luisa (Kristin Taylor). Over the course of a few days, Anna meets Michael's girlfriend Shonda (Chloe Mason), and his neighbor Gary (Joe Lo Truglio, ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine""). Gary has Asperger's, plus a few other afflictions, and often pops in for a scoop of Michael's sugar.Anna is not prepared for Michael's backlash to her decision, and that leads to heartfelt conversation, as well as an initially defensive Luisa when she arrives. It's touching to see how Shonda and Gary react, and to see Michael's emotional evolution. Of course, he doesn't want to lose his beloved sister - the one he's only just reconnected with. We can all relate to his feelings. But as Anna says, it's her decision and she would rather go out on her own terms, than in a cold hospital with tubes sticking out.This is the directorial debut and first screenplay from Tim True, who shares ties to Oregon with his co-writer Csaba Mera. Of course this is a tough and controversial topic. We witness Anna's labored breathing and the other effects of late stage cancer, and the heaviness is offset a bit thanks to Gary's t-shirts and coffee mugs. An alternative title to the film could be 'the long goodbye', but Anna's farewell is handled very well by the actors and filmmakers. Anna recites a poem (from Mary Lee Hall) with the line, ""Turn again to life, and smile"", and we realize she's made the decision that's right for her.

The script has so many obvious mistakes while the plot is completely stupid and full of holes, not to mention that the acting is so awkward, it feels like it's all just a bunch of friends playing sharades.

187,3128824,2016-08-14,AlsExGal,Ghost (1990),9.0,"I have to admit that Demi Moore as artist Molly and Patrick Swayze as Sam, an investment banker, had great chemistry. This was extremely popular when it came out in 1990, even winning an academy award for Whoopi Goldberg, whose career had been on a downturn up to that point.

Sam and Molly have a great life in New York City. She is an up and coming artist, he is doing well at his investment banking job. They turn part of a run down building into a yuppie paradise loft apartment. But Sam has a problem expressing his love verbally. And then Sam and Molly are mugged by a common street criminal one night while walking home. Sam is shot and killed while defending Molly, and suddenly finds himself outside of his own body. Nobody can hear him. Nobody can see him. But he can converse with other ""ghosts"" that he finds. He hangs out in his old apartment to be near Molly, and then something happens that makes him think his murder was not a coincidence. The guy who killed him lets himself into his apartment with a key and begins looking for something in particular. He is obviously not there to steal the television. And from there the murder mystery begins.

I still salute this movie for one inventive turn - the most unlikely protagonist ally in film history - Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic who turns out to be the only person who can hear Sam. She is rude, crude, at times greedy, somewhat racist and very mouthy and with a rap sheet a mile long for bunco artistry. But she does end up helping Sam, although he spends all night at her bedside singing ""I'm Henry VIII I am"" to get her to cooperate. However, you will like her, in part because she is so real and believable.

The philosophical questions I mentioned? I guess the biggest question raised is who is a ""good"" person worthy of heaven and who is a ""bad"" person worthy of hell? Are there mitigating circumstances? The film has both of Sam's murderers going to hell. Were they BOTH that bad? One of the killers seemed like he might have been a good person until greed tempted him to the point that he got in over his head for some quick money. He was like Fred C. Dobbs in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" without the gold mine and the endless Mexican desert. And what about Sam? He kills two people , at first attacking them to defend others - and it has got to be scary being chased and beat up by something you can't see - but he seems to have fun scaring them to the point of frenzy. I mean, what did he think was going to happen in each case? Yet he seems surprised when they end up dead at his hands in what could be considered self defense taken to the point of revenge. Yet he goes to heaven. Maybe the scale of eternal reward doesn't weigh acts performed after death? Ponderous.

This one might seem cheesy at points, especially the pottery making/lovemaking scene, but I think it still holds up over time. I'd recommend it.",541,0,,0,No reference

My only complaint is the fact that many jokes were included that were either ""over kids heads"" or just not quite rated G. Even Eddie Murphy could tone it down for a kids film. The constant blah blah from the donkey character becomes tiresome quickly. Hold the babble water! Aside from these minor blemishes I give ""Shrek"" 2 thumbs up!****",128,0,,0,No reference

No, I can relate to neither that spoiling fatherhood nor the ""need to own rather than share"" ambition, but now I can reason with the anomaly and its toxic effects per se. The flow is somewhat convoluted, particularly if you miss the flashbacks, and overall it may feel incoherent but the actings are superb and moments are deep with extreme highs and lows. In the end you're left with numerous dots to connect, expecting you to put some effort into i.e. makes you think.

191,4673565,2020-01-21,neilr-67891,The Mad Axeman (2019),10.0,"You might well think that yet another film about the activities of the Kray Gang receiving a DVD release would be an exercise in once again celebrating the supposedly legendary status of the twins. Neither the title of the film or the cover of the DVD provide any evidence to the contrary. But both the title and artwork are misleading however. Surprisingly given the subject matter the actual story is a subtle and complex study of the relationships between the three main characters in the film, each one caught up, often reluctantly in the world of the Krays.The story deals with true events surrounding the escape of Krays associate Frank Mitchell from Dartmoor prison in December 1966. The Krays mastermind the escape, then hide Frank and his minder John in a London flat. Later they provide him with a female escortThe screenplay was adapted by Gill Adams from her original award winning stage play 'Jump to Cow Heaven' and though extended and altered it shares the emotional impact of the theatrical version. Frank Mitchell, John and Lisa are not the stock characters commonly portrayed in this genre. Perhaps surprisingly the film is as much a love story as it is a portrayal of gangland life.The three principal actors all give excellent performances. The role of escaped convict Frank Michell played by Diarmaid Murtagh is a particularly difficult one, as he is often an annoying and sometimes violent presence, who is at times difficult to empathise with. But by the end of the film we have a very different impression of him. He like John, his minder and Lisa his escort are victims and prisoners caught up in the orbit of the Krays. Morgan Watkins brings great warmth and subtlety to a world weary John. However I think the outstanding performance in the film belongs to Elen Rhys as the escort brought in to entertain and pacify Frank. Though outwardly confident her vulnerability is also evident and both aspects of her personality are skilfully and convincingly presented.First time director Will Kerley, known best previously for his work in opera also directed the original stage play and his familiarity with the characters ensures
that the nuances in their personalities and their developing relationships are well handled.The Krays themselves are minor characters in the story, though their uneasy and ultimately malign presence are constantly apparent. The tension builds as it
becomes clear that Frank's dreams of a pardon freedom look unlikely to be
fulfilled and we have sympathy for his predicament, that of John and particularly the frightened Lisa. An emotionally rich and carefully crafted film.",433,0,,0,No reference

His therapist is an abrasive loose cannon, who has methods that are unorthodox to say the least. Considering Dave's lonely life, meeting Buddy Rydell might be a blessing in disguise for him. I originally saw this in theaters and remember being highly amused by this movie. I didn't remember much about it...and decided to re-watch it. I enjoy Sandler's older movies when he actually cared about making people laugh. I wouldn't call this movie the perfect comedy by any means, but there are definitely some laugh out loud moments to be had. It's a little sad to see Nicholson stoop to these antics, but I'm not ashamed to admit that he was hilarious. He works well with Sandler and steals many of the scenes. I laughed my ass off at one of his quotes. ""Then he pulled out his winky and told her it was a Strawberry Ice Cream Cone"" He even sings ""I Feel Pretty"" with Adam Sandler! Nicholson isn't afraid to make a fool of himself in this movie and looked to be having a blast! The guy can turn anything into gold. Beneath him or not, he was amazing. It does get stagnant after a while, but for about 75-80 minutes, it's good times. It has your typical crudeness with Sandler's patented ""childish routine"" but he is funny. It's not a strong acting performance, but he is very entertaining! That's all that counts for me. Marisa Tomei's character is somewhat bland, but she's easy on the eyes and delivers an OK performance. Woody Harrelson has a small, but funny part. The last 25 minutes get sentimental and mushy, with a pretty clever twist that surprised me with how well it was executed. I used to be a big Adam Sandler fan! Hell, I still am to a certain extent. I'm just tired of being let down by his laziness. This movie does what it sets out to do, giving the viewer some outrageous laughs. That's what I wanted and that's exactly what I got. Remember!

198,2672324,2014-06-02,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Universal Soldier: The Return (1999),2.0,"After Roland Emmerich's Universal Soldier (1992), the series was capitalized on its success by producing sequels to it that were released on TV. However, these ""sequels"" as they were called, were received poorly due to fans' lack of interest and a far less entertaining cast. Then 1999 rolled around and Universal Soldier fans were surprised to see this come to their TV informing them trailer style that Van Damme was returning. It's curious to say what the title to this actual sequel just meant ""the return"" of. Was it the return of Jean-Claude Van Damme as Luc Deveraux? Or was it that the plot to this installment revolved around Deveraux returning to a similar station where Unisols were created just like him? Maybe it wasn't even that deep. Perhaps the producers just meant it was the return from the TV productions back into actual theatrically released movies. No one will know and probably not many will care either because this installment barely qualifies as a sequel.

The reason why it is difficult for this movie to be called a sequel to the 1992 original is because of how flimsy the writing connects to its predecessor. After the 1992 film, there wasn't anybody left working on the Unisol project. Everyone except Deveraux had died because of how badly the project turned out to be. Yet, here we are (with no perception of how much time has passed between both films), Deveraux is now one of the leads of operation at a new Unisol factory. Apparently he acquired his humanity back from two meaningless scientists that have very little importance later on in the film. During a regular day, the main computer system (S.E.T.H. - voiced by Michael Jai White) becomes self-aware and decides that it's time he takes control. So who exactly approved the Unisol program? Plus, all the scientists were dead. Who knew how to regenerate more dead soldiers? It was a tiny select group of people.

But this is the least of the problems. First of all, why is Deveraux assisting in the creation of more Unisols? What's his motivation behind this? What possible benefit could he have from this if he knows exactly what could go wrong? It doesn't make any sense. There's even a scene where Deveraux has a flashback to his death and the kind of treatment he was given when he was a Unisol. This almost hints at that Deveraux isn't passed his own stress, but it's never visited again. Deveraux even has a daughter named Hillary who he named after his wife of the same name - wait what? In the 1992 movie, the nosey news reporter was named Veronica and most fans can safely agree that it looked like the future couple was going to be Deveraux and Veronica. Where did this Hillary girl come in? Even more insulting is how obvious and obligatory it becomes when Deveraux comes in contact with another thickheaded female reporter, guess where that goes.

These issues alone amount to a very confusing, poorly written main character that feels like a totally different person. Forget trying to even understand anyone else that's brought in because his or her development is given far less attention. The villain played by Michael Jai White brings up multiple questions as well. Just because a computer system becomes self-aware does not mean it all of sudden knows how to perform martial arts. S.E.T.H.'s motivations are also unexplained besides him wanting to rid the world of chaos. I assume this was apart of the fad for 1999 - making all computers self aware and ready to massacre mankind. Then there's Bill Goldberg as the skull-smashing wrestler turned Unisol. The only thing audiences will know about him is that he hates Deveraux. Why - no will know because it's never explained. What's the point of creating a personality if there's nothing to back it up? I enjoyed him more as the silent type in Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003).

William Malone and John Fasano are the writers behind this. Fasano was probably the man behind all the parts to the film that tried to recollect on what made the original as good as it could be. For all that, it seems like Malone's parts were favored more, which is what made this story so inconsistent. Malone is also the director behind the illogical Creature (1985) film. Just horrendously bad. What's even stranger is that these two writers tried to incorporate comedic lines that are as subtle as the ones of the first. For example, going back to Goldberg, he would be flattened by something and say ""I hate that guy"" in a cartoony way. What made the first movie funny at times was that of how deadpan it was delivered. Here, it just sounds silly.

Mic Rodgers whose real profession is in stunt coordination directed the film. It's also very obvious because this movie contains a lot of action scenes involving stunts so it fits that this would be what he focuses on most. However, this doesn't fix anything. The action is generic and again, cartoonish at times. It's mindless action - nothing complex. Surprisingly for 1999, there aren't many special effects either. Cinematography isn't great either because very little of this movie takes places outside a building, and if it is, it's in the dark. Lastly, Don Davis' score has some quality to it but again, it's nothing that's really memorable considering several times hardcore metal is put in from time to time. Metal is fine but it has to be used in the right manner. This wasn't it and Davis isn't a newbie at composing. He scored the Matrix trilogy!

It's practically nothing like the 1992 original. For a title that supposed to signify the return of greatness - the return is far less than even minimally acceptable. Continuing stories do not contain writing like this.",984,0,,0,No reference

Although several reviewers have praised the set some of them are guilty of minor errors; at least two people state categorically that the disc containing Tonight At 8.30 features ALL the plays that Coward wrote for the theatre in 1936. This is incorrect. Coward wrote TEN plays for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, one of which, Star Chamber, was not performed, but NINE one-act plays WERE performed and Joan Collins performs only EIGHT, omitting We Were Dancing. Another reviewer states that this 7-disc collection comprises virtually all Coward's ouevre which is patently ridiculous as, for one thing, all the Revues and Musicals are missing, some of which - Bittersweet, London Calling, This Year of Grace, Words and Music, Operette, Pacific 1860, After The Ball, Ace of Clubs, Sail Away, Conversation Piece, Cavalcade etc - contain some of his most enduring songs, to say nothing of plays like Waiting In The Wings, The Marquise, The Queen Was In The Parlor, Point Valaine, Peace In Our Time, This Happy Breed, South Sea Bubble, Nude With Violin, and more. Bon Voyage is a fine example of the Hollywood 'bomber-crew' film in which a disparate group of people share a confined space - in this case an ocean liner - and we get several stories for the price of one and a dash of happiness and tears, in this case the dramatic death of a character we have come to like and the happy ending to a shipboard romance.

217,2599808,2014-01-25,TheLittleSongbird,Valentino (1977),7.0,"Once you realise and accept(if you can) that what is depicted in Valentino is far from what really happened then you will find a lot of enjoyment here. Ken Russell has done better with Women in Love, The Devils and The Music Lovers(also his even better composer documentaries, apart from the Richard Strauss one), it is though certainly more watchable than Lisztomania. The storytelling, told in flashback structure, is jumpy in places which makes it not always easy to follow and I agree that the characters are written flatly, they're very well played but you wish that you learnt more about them. Plus Rudolph Nureyev is a very mixed bag in the title role, he is an incredible dancer(in ballet one of the greats, his chemistry with Margot Fonteyn perhaps unparallelled) and it shows in the beautifully choreographed dance routines, the tango especially, he was also a very handsome man, his chemistry with his colleagues credible and does show some expressive acting in the dances. His dialogue delivery is another story, often very awkward-sounding and at times incomprehensible, and while charismatic and athletic his acting outside the dance routines was at times too subtle and not matching with the acting style of films from the first twenty years of the 20th century. Leslie Caron however looks as though she was having a whale of a time and is gleefully enjoyable, while Michelle Phillips is more restrained and is touching and delightful. Felicity Kendall is also very involved and Carol Kane and Seymour Cassell delight. Ken Russell writes himself in and is thankfully nowhere near as embarrassingly bad as he was in Salome's Last Dance. The music is fitting, it captures the period beautifully and is used in a way that enhances the atmosphere yet accommodates the more dramatic elements. Visually Valentino is a gorgeous film to look at, one of Russell's most visually pleasing films. The sets and colours are lavish and the costumes, hair-styles and make-up are unmistakably 20s. The dance scenes show off Nureyev's talents really well and are intoxicating, while the sexual moments are mostly sexual but sometimes gratuitous. The script is appropriately dark-humoured and sharply biting, you cannot resist how Valentino's conflicts with different people(mainly moguls hungry for power and actresses) are depicted, even if it doesn't say a lot about the characters. Russell like his actors seems to be really enjoying himself, the film is full of his style which goes to go how much the direction shines. And thankfully his stylistic touches while not exactly restrained are not overly-excessive or distasteful, Caron's entrance at the funeral is eye-poppingly operatic, while Valentino's jail encounter, the fight sequence and the staging of the funeral are every bit as entertaining and grandly staged, managing to do so in a way that is not too overblown. In conclusion, not for people expecting a history lesson(and that is not meant to sound derogatory if it does come across that way, more as a forewarning as to what to expect) but for a well-made film that does spark at least an ounce of interest Valentino is worth a viewing. 7/10 Bethany Cox",522,0,,0,No reference

During their evening, a heated debate about their relationship is ignited.While Céline calls Jesse's fidelity into question, he challenges her parenting skills, which results in her doubting their love.With its relevant stance on relationship qualms, this second sequel to Before Sunrise serves as an endearing and worthy bookend to the dialogue heavy trilogy that began in 1995.Luckily, thanks to Greece's recession, you can easily get out of the doghouse by buying your wife the Parthenon.

The great thing about Dexter is that it is completely different from any other TV show every made.I love the ride that you take with the characters, especially with our main man Dexter, constantly having questions unanswered and constantly wanting to know and figure out what is going to happen next. I think what makes the show so engaging is the fact that we have this guy, Dexter, who we become so emotionally and heroically attached to, and we are given a sense and feeling that we want him to prevail and we don't want him to ever be caught or found out who he really is, yet at the same time we sometimes question and doubt the actions that Dexter takes. I believe we as the audience would also find so many similarities in Dexter and his everyday life and at the same time we ask ourselves why Dexter is the way he is, which is another factor as to why he becomes such a successful protagonist.Overall this is a fantastic and thoroughly engaging and addictive TV show, that at times will leave you shocked, disgusted then at other times will leave you happy and relieved for our protagonist, among many other emotions.",217,0,,0,No reference

My thought before I saw the film were that it would be just a copy of all the other ""Peter Pan"" films. I can say for sure I were surprised how well done this film was. I can just agree with the other comment, the kids in this film do a marvelous job.

My favorite scene is when the family and Mr.Barrie are flying with the Kite. When Michael gets the Kite up in the air is a magical moment, I always gets tears in my eyes. Maybe it is because you know that he will get it up or the music.

Talking about the music...I love soundtracks, all kinds. Kaczmarek is my new hero of film composers. I give you as an advise to listen to the music in this film.

It's something magical with this film, you get feeling of being young and you have the whole world in your hands.

Metaphor: Darren went to the great soda fountain of metaphor and Biblical allegory and he made what some call a ""Suicide"", just a shot of every possible sugary beverage possible, and some cheap booze in a similar varietal. Likely an 8-ball of cocaine to make it seem like a good idea. Then he drank it down quickly (""I wrote the script in just 5 days"" Darren splendors - Oh Really? And I presume you're beyond editorial support at this point in your artistic pinnacle?). He then took his current real-life girlfriend, Jennifer Lawrence, (Jen. Run. You're better than this.) and he strapped some electrodes to her for shock value, and he peed all over her and filmed it using only three shots for some film-school-senior-project level fancy: close up, from behind, and point of view. Then he praised himself for making a film that is 'really about how we are treating mother earth'. Yeah. He did that. And he thinks he's smarter than you. I am not sure if there is enough cocaine in Hollywood to explain the amount of ego masturbation that this film portrays. The whole not-too-subtle story of Artist as God who abuses his muse and is obsessed with praise is heavy handed. You're not a God, Darren. Your art is pretentious tripe, much like the intestines of the baby on the sacrificial table. The real kick in the labia is the utter misogyny of the film, produced by a group of ONLY males (6 producers, editor, cinematographer, etc, plus the Douche). So, a penis parade made a nightmarish film about motherhood and society's dismissal of the feminine and weren't smart enough to see the irony in not having a single woman above-the-line on the production? You fellas are just a bushel of genius right there.I feel like I need to wash Aronofsky's spooge from my eyes.

235,2336897,2012-08-23,AudioFileZ,Safe (I) (2012),6.0,"This movie is about rival international gangs and a young girl who is a number wunderkind. But, we really know before hand it's about Jason Statham disposing of ""bad guys"". After a slow-ish beginning to setup the Chinese, Russians, and bad cops - and how the little Chinese girl and Statham relate to their Chinatown fiefdom - violence occurs at an extremely fast pace; one could almost call it ""violence porn"" taking into count the visual quantity which, thankfully, spares some of the all too common graphicness. Somehow, the bit of humanity wrapped up in the girl buffers it just the smallest bit as it becomes Stratham's noble vendetta. Statham's fall and rise hinges on this new purpose: to save the little girl. He takes it serious and fights out of the corruption while taking no prisoners.Seen as an action vehicle for Statham this movie fairs a bit better than average as after the slow beginning it moves fast and with masterful fight scenes and a decent enough story. The character of Mei, played by newcomer Catherine Chan, is the standout here: she's a cool professional delivering nuance beyond her age. It's complimented by the usual, but well-casted cops/international bad guy plethora of characters anchored by the steely cold Robert John Burke. Of course, front and center is Statham and he's complicated so as you root for him you still have a sense of dread knowing his character is on the precipice of being beyond redemption due to his circumstances. In other words...A character for Statham with some meat on the bones which he delivers.If you like action it's here and that is the bottom line. A Statham movie where he does his sch-tick well building to a crescendo that is satisfying. There isn't great depth, however, and that is what keeps the movie from rating higher. It's action entertainment that is over-the-top, but doesn't fall apart if you park some of the right-brain matter. I must say that in the times we're now in it becomes harder to appreciate a movie purely based on violent action, but as mentioned earlier in spite of the quantity the graphic level of it isn't pandered. Statham fans, as well as action lovers, should be fine with a recommendation as it quite a ride after ignition.",383,0,keeps the movie from getting higher,0,No reference

They suspect businessman Max Zorin of selling details to them.  When Bond is sent to investigate he finds that Zorin is not only stockpiling silicon but also drilling near the San Andreas fault.  Bond begins to suspect that Zorin does more than just sell secrets.Bond once had a cruel rough edge here that is all but gone with Moore's eye-brow raising technique.  The plot here is of some interest but really it doesn't convince.  The lack of real tension or action takes a lot away from this film and, although it has it's moments, it is really very poor by the high standards of Bond.  However fans of Bond may well like it all the same  I still enjoyed it although I felt that it could have been better.Moore is looking old  his was his last Bond.  He looks too old for this type of thing and it means he's like an aging camp icon in a spy spoof rather than the great Bond as we know him.  Walken is a good bad guy  in other filmshere his natural sinister air gives way to a wildly eccentric villain.  He really should have done what he usually does.  Grace Jones is no Bond girl and really isn't used well.  People like Patrick Macnee and the usual cast add class but really it's only window dressing on a messy film.As with all Bonds this has plenty of nice touches but really this lacks the style and the flair that made the other ones work.

239,2772754,2014-12-06,Likes_Ninjas90,出埃及記：天地王者 (2014),4.0,"Ridley Scott's Exodus: Gods and Kings is a grandly staged but soulless and mediocre retelling of Moses liberating the slaves of Egypt. It is one of two Bible films released in 2014, following Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which envisioned a corrupt world cleansed of evil by a violent God and where a single man was enlisted to salvage a group of people. This description is applicable to Exodus given the over familiarity of its plotting and characters. The return of these Biblical epics is not only because Hollywood is heavily influenced by Christian values and religious groups in the industry. The popularisation of epics in the vein of Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments and William Wyler's Ben Hur is also political. Currently, violence and extremism are perpetuated by radical fundamentalists misinterpreting religion. Bible stories are as current as they are ancient, relaying the Old Testament's brutality and reflecting perpetually violent attitudes of modern extremists.While Aronofsky's film gambled on bleak, moody stylisation, Exodus' treatment is safe and unsurprising, adhering to a fault to past filmmaking traditions. Prior to the film's release, an online boycott was launched, attacking the decision to cast White actors in major roles of Middle Eastern characters. White imitation, where Anglo- Saxon actors impersonate ethnic roles, is an unproud, archaic Hollywood practice. Ridley Scott defended the casting in a Variety interview: ""I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain, and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such."" His insensitivity doesn't account for how White actors today would be forbidden from playing a Black character, particularly in America. Similarly, given Hollywood's oversaturated marketing budgets, would it be too difficult to sell the film on Scott's name alone or introduce new actors to the world?Casting recognisable stars detracts sharply from the film's period rendering. Featuring Englishmen Christian Bale and Ben Kingsley, Americans Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro and Aaron Paul and Australians Ben Mendelsohn and Joel Edgerton, there's a wave of familiar faces and accents jarring with the setting and typifying the film's homogenisation. Rarely does an image, a line of dialogue, or character feel unique to the film either. The opening quarter particularly mimics Scott's Gladiator too closely. Moses (Bale) is a more skillful warrior and tactician than his half brother Ramses (Edgerton). He saves Ramses life in an early battle scene and Ramses' father Seti (John Turturro) seems to favour him more even though he is adopted and unlikely to become the next Pharaoh. After investigating the thieving shonky practices of Hegep (Mendelsohn), Moses's true Hebrew heritage is explained to him by Nun (Ben Kingsley). Hegep reveals this to Ramses, who forces Moses into exile. Moses starts a family of his own in a village, with a wife and son. After hitting his head he is plagued by visions of God inhabiting the body of a young boy (Isaac Andrews), who encourages him to free the Hebrews from enslavement. His fate of being exiled, his goal and motives are highly similar to Maximus.Bale's inclusion accentuates the derivativeness of the archetype. Instead of a cape and a mask, Moses wields a gold sword. But like Bruce Wayne, Moses's arc is typical of Hollywood characters searching for individualism. He predictably transitions from denying his legacy to liberating his people and reuniting himself with his family. The script rewritten by Steve Zaillian from Bill Collage and Adam Cooper's drafts takes Moses through unnecessary detours. Ramses only considers killing Moses long after he's exiled and a training montage where Moses teaches soldiers to fight is wasted when God unleashes the plagues instead. Moses becomes displaced from the story, except for a tangent where he disapproves of God's methods of justice. The plagues of Egypt are admittedly disturbing and visceral, but the literal interpretation diminishes possibilities of Moses imagining God. One unsettling dramatic touch is cutting to Ramses' family life before the plagues, which builds tension knowing his son's fate. But Ramses isn't a juicy villain but a weak symbol of hubris. Joel Edgerton doesn't have a firm grasp on what angle to take, meaning we don't entirely feel the emotion of his blindness and rage.Once Exodus escapes its stifled first half, the rest of narrative from the plagues onwards is overly familiar, bloody and brutal and supplies the actors with predictable, punchline dialogue spoken in plain English. There was a chance here to touch upon refugees escaping war and enslavement. These are issues dramatised only through the rhythms of action set pieces. While Scott's Robin Hood cut a new origin story into an old tale and reinvented the characters, there are fewer surprises about how this film develops because of how risk-averse it is with the narrative and the casting. While the scale of the film is huge and cinematic, it's the finer attention to detail in the screenplay and the period which feel lacking. Imagination and distinction are not qualities one would expect missing from the director who made Alien and Blade Runner. But in his twilight year Ridley Scott is determined largely to make epics of numbers rather than people.",852,0,,0,No reference

241,880959,2005-01-08,bzzzbee,The Incredibles (2004),,"You see the trailers, view the making of special and it still delivers?! What a terrific movie and a rarity these days, unless it is a Pixar initiative. While it seems to borrow the dual identity premise of Spy Kids (2001), the large variety of wacky superheroes like Mystery Men (1999), the reworked superpowers of The Fantastic Four, the excitement and energy of the best James Bond movies and the character fallibilities of Spider-man 2 (2004) it is largely a unique movie in its own right.It is fundamentally an action movie but what sets Pixar movies apart, from not only other animated but standard flicks, is the humanity it imparts. There are elements similar to the Iron Giant (1999), also directed by Mr Bird, that are very touching. The characters have depth and by the end of it most viewers will have something they can take away from the experience. A bit like an Aesop's fable using outstanding animation.This isn't a by-the-numbers movie where the film-makers left all their great work on a white board. These people obviously care deeply about the project, the story and the characters. This makes it easy for the viewer to feel compassion and sympathy for 'The Incredibles' and strongly dislike the villain. While the animated special effects are, dare I say it, INCREDIBLE, this movie has heart and any effects used have a purpose that enhances the story.There is also a great sense of comedy. Some of the scenes featuring the parents in various situations had me laughing out loud. Like all the other Pixar movies there is plenty of fun for the adults. Not so many in-jokes as the Toy Story movies as this movie stands strongly by itself with its own style. Mr Incredible's ever increasing paunch is something I can really relate to. Whatever happened to the glory days when I could feel my ribs! I'm going to see this again. The movie reinforces the importance of family, to treat others as you'd treat yourself and don't take life for granted. In times of war and crippling natural disasters these messages couldn't come at a better time. Yet it avoids preaching to the audience and being overly overt in delivering its messages.It is perfect for parents who want to do something entertaining with their kids or for people like me in their early-30s who appreciate good film making, a nice chocolate ice-cream/box of popcorn and laughing together with complete strangers.",409,0,,0,No reference

I am still surprised at the type of fan fare it is getting though with many people giving it a ten and saying it's the best live action spiderman they've ever seen. I wouldn't go that far to giving it credit. What it does well is follow up Endgame very well and tells a whole new story. It also manages to bring the underlying story of Spiderman to the big screen and that is a kid with superhero powers trying to balance that with being a teenager and falling in love and school and friends etc. This manages to capture that very well considering it's all about monsters and aliens and destruction. The CGI battles are plenty and the CGI is quite well done but there is a lot of it. It was nice to have some of the younger people playing supporting cast members like Zendaya (who actually makes a very good, layered MJ) , Jacob Batalon and Angourie Rice. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a decent villain as the bizarre Mysterio. He sort of overplays it, a little campy at times but it works for the most part. I didn't think his chemistry with Tom Holland was all that great but it was still good to see a new villain on the big screen. Speaking of chemistry, I think Tom Holland and Zendaya are actually great together and I wasn't sure how she would fare as Mary Jane but the two of them are quite good together.

Ames is a sleazy music producer, who goes on about his constant affairs with several other women despite his wife's knowledge of it happening and the fact he also has kids as well. Ames is driving on a dark and stormy night and it is hinted that a insane woman has escaped the local mental hospital. He ventures out to a cabin in the woods that he owns only to find a mysterious woman named Cathy there naked covered in a sheet, trying to escape the storm. She is an aspiring actress and as his usual perv self he asks her to stay for the night till the storm passes. Strangely Cathy begins to seduce him and they both have sex. However, he then hears the radio broadcast again about the escaped woman who has a tendency to cut her lovers throats with kitchen knives, and her description fits Cathy's perfectly, but, is she really the killer?. This is a really fun episode that's what you'd come to expect from a series like this. You have some great nudity, a little bit of softcore sex (both courtesy of HBO) and a fun game of cat and mouse between the two protagonists. The only thing is that you can probably see how the ending is going if you've ever watched shows like this before, but, it doesn't ruin the fun of it. August Schellenberg plays the sleazy womanizer perfectly and the little known Pamela Bowman who seems to have had just a short 8 year or so stretch in mostly guest television roles, does decent and defiantly has no problem in showing skin.

I didn't see it on original release, because I happen to be somewhat fascinated by the Ed Gein story and have read up on it, and I was afraid the film would be a B-movie exploitation of one of the most bizarre episodes in the history of American crime. Gee, I wish it were.This film is really a pretty mediocre docu-drama that attempts to explain away the more disturbing aspects of the Gein story with cheap and easy Freudian references, down to having Gein see and listen to his dead mother urge him on to do ""God's work"" by ""punishing"" wicked women for their sexuality.Unfortunately, this explanation doesn't tell us anything at all about Gein's cannibalism, nor about his almost childish fascination for body parts. In one scene in a bar, Gein suddenly asks the other customers whether any of them know about sex-change operations. I take it this was cut into the movie to explain Gein's efforts to wear the skin of some of his victims, and certainly the real Gein was interested in the issue. What gets lost here is all the rich sense of transformation that might go into a sick fascination for donning the skin of another human being. This isn't simply changing one's sex - this is becoming something other than human.One other point - as a Freudian explanation, the film has Gein denying responsibility for his murders - either he can't remember them, or it was ""mom's fault"". Wait a minute - could Gein have just ignored all those body parts cluttering up his house? Obviously not; in fact the real Gein was aware of what he was doing - he just didn't think there was anything wrong with it. The only reason we know parts of his story is because he was able to give detailed descriptions of what he did. He approached murder, dismemberment, and cannibalism with a clinical disinterest in any of the moral implications of these acts. It was simply Gein's way of living in the world.Now that is truly frightening. The terrible thing about Gein was that he was utterly bland - he was the guy next door, the quiet neighbor, not very interesting, not much to say.Few films have managed to capture this quality about any serial killer.

Sam (Chris Pine) returns home when his father dies, returning home we see that Sam did not get on well with his deceased father. Meeting with his dad's lawyer he learns that he has a half-sister that he never knew he had. When he meets this women named Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) he takes a while to tell her the truth about him leading to the two of them starting a relationship which is built around lies through Sam.The story is very predictable when such scenes as Frankie falling for Sam only to get super mad at him when learning the truth only at the end to forgive him over the thing they have in common which was a bad dad. Even when some of the scenes are predictable the film does have some great dramatic moments such as many of the scenes shared between Pine and Pfeiffer. Some of the writing was not well written especially some lines that had me confused and they mostly came from the son of Frankie and how most of his dialogue was laughable to me. I believe that the film is based on a true story because I would not know why some person would want to write and original story like this one. The film's cinematography was very bad to me because usually it seemed they used sunlight too much on these actors faces to try make them look more dramatic especially when Pine would look into the distant sometimes, this was not a good use of cinematography at all.Chris Pine plays Sam and shows once again that he is not as good an actor as someone with his fame could be by taking risks. Everyone else around him comes off better mainly because he is just not a dramatic actor and should stick to his action films were he is not called to give a performance but just jump and run. Elizabeth Banks has been great at comedy but in this film as Frankie she gets to show how her dramatic work can be. She has fun in some scenes opposite Pine but sometimes when she is being dramatic she is believable but at other times she could have been better. She is better then Pine because her character does have more of a transformation. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Pine's mother Lillian and she truly is the best thing in her limited scenes with Pine. It's not one of her career best performances but she does such a great job in the film acting very natural and being the most emotional performance in the film that made me tear up sometimes. Also some actors in limited time such as Olivia Wilde are also worth a shout out. The actor playing the kid tried to make this character good but I was just annoyed by the child whenever he said anything.The film is fine with some moments that are laughable even if the film was based off true events. Performances are fine with Michelle Pfeiffer being the standout in performance and in emotions that the film really needed. Overall I enjoyed the film and the chemistry that a lot of the actors had in the film.MOVIE GRADE: B- (MVP: Michelle Pfeiffer)",618,0,,0,No reference

They are also, all three,unsatisfying movies. In THE PLEDGE--a sort of U.S. remake ofL'HUMANITE, with the quixotic aspect of Kurosawa's IKIRU thrownin--Jack Nicholson plays, as he did in Penn's CROSSING GUARD,an aging guy haunted by the death of a child. A retiring cop,Nicholson swears to the mother of a murdered girl that he will findthe killer. Along the way, he runs into a battered single mom(Robin Wright Penn) whose beautiful child becomes the light ofNicholson's life--and the grain of hope that he may redeemhimself.But...redeem from what? is the question I found myself asking.Unlike the bureaucrat in IKIRU, or Harvey Keitel's Bad Lieutenant,Nicholson's character doesn't particularly seem in need ofabsolution. All we see is a polite, thoughtful and deeply moral guy.So what's all the breast-beating about? (One gets the feeling thatSean Penn lives for breast-beating.)Penn creates moments of soaring, rolling, rhythmic beauty. Hehas one of the world's greatest cinematographers in ChrisMendes, and many of the scenes of Nicholson's blossoming inrustic family life have a stirring, effulgent quality. But Penn seemsunable to get actors in a scene to make a basic point.

279,5328088,2020-10-19,Shala-Shaska,Asphalt Urban GT (2004 Video Game),10.0,"Asphalt: Urban GT is quite obviously a game that was not designed with the DS specifically in mind, and it doesn't try to shoehorn in dual-screen or touch-sensitive elements where they're not necessary. This game is simply a fun little racer, and one of the best-looking DS launch titles to boot.Asphalt looked pretty good when it was released earlier on the N-Gage, but it looks even better on the larger DS screen, and it sports a much, much better frame rate. The bevy of licensed cars featured in the game capture the look of their real-world counterparts quite accurately, even if they do tend to be a little boxy. Along with a downright impressive variety of cars, the game keeps the visuals interesting with tracks set in a great variety of locations. Each track has a unique and well-defined look, and they're all quite good at evoking the feel of the cities they're based on (smart use of shadows and some reflective effects help to further the feeling that you're actually in these environments). The rock-solid frame rate helps create a good sense of speed, which is further accentuated by the camera-rattle effect that accompanies the turbo boost. The draw-in distance is occasionally noticeable, but it's not bad enough that it affects the actual gameplay experience, and you really have to look to see it. All of the actual racing action takes place on the upper screen, and the lower screen primarily shows a course map and the current positions of all the racers. It's not a particularly inventive use of the lower screen, but it's functional, and being able to anticipate long straightaways helps to make the best use of your turbo boosts.Though the game is graphically impressive, its sound leaves much to be desired. Our biggest issue with the sound is that of the actual cars. The effects themselves aren't that bad--the engine sounds good and throaty, with a layer of high-pitch whine at higher speeds, and the tires squeal around corners satisfyingly. But no matter what you're driving, be it an H2 Hummer, a Jaguar XKR, or a classic Morgan roadster, all the cars use exactly the same sound effects, which takes away from the uniqueness that the game otherwise does a pretty good job of imbuing all the cars with. Filling in any gaps in between the blaring car sounds is a rather trite soundtrack of mechanical break beats and by-the-numbers synth sounds.Asphalt aims for a simple, arcade-inspired design ethic, and this is very much apparent in the game's controls, which consist simply of gas, brake, and turbo-boost buttons, and the D pad for steering. The game curiously allows you to extensively remap any single control function--if you want the left shoulder button to act as your right turn control, so be it--but the game's use of the DS touch screen is limited to menu navigation.Taking a page from Criterion's Burnout series, the game allows you to increase the amount of nitrous you have at your disposal by drifting around corners, coming dangerously close to the other traffic on the streets and busting up certain objects on the side of the road, though you're also constantly gaining more turbo boost even when not pulling off such maneuvers. The N-Gage version of Asphalt was a lot more liberal with the boost, starting each race with more boost and filling your boost meter more quickly. That the DS version reins in the amount of boost you're given is a good thing, as it makes the overall game more challenging and requires you to be more thoughtful about when to use your turbo boost. The game has a pretty good sense of speed, and each of its 20-plus licensed cars handles fairly uniquely and appropriately. This occasionally leads to certain cars simply not being much fun to drive, but for the most part it works to the game's advantage.The biggest fault in Asphalt's gameplay is with the collision detection, which is all over the place. The props that you can run into and destroy have no effect on your speed, and there are other objects--such as the palm trees that split part of the course on the Hong Kong track--that you can just pass right through. Collision with other cars is the worst, though. Bumping into other cars that are going in the same direction as you are is stuttery and unnatural looking. The game seems to always give priority to the other car in a collision, which means it's never to your advantage to rub with another racer, as they can easily nudge you off-course as you're drifting around a corner. Running into oncoming traffic causes your car to go into a canned spinout. This can actually occasionally work to your advantage, since you'll sometimes accelerate even more when you're spinning out and you'll usually retain that speed when you reset. Since the game's release on the N-Gage, it feels like Gameloft has cleaned up the collision detection in Asphalt a bit, but it still stands as the weakest link in the otherwise enjoyable gameplay.It's obviously not a simulation, but Asphalt does make a nod to many rally-racing games by flashing the general direction of an upcoming turn moments before you hit it. This provides you with just enough time to position yourself and get ready to start applying the brakes to begin the drift. Asphalt gets a lot of mileage out of this straight-up control scheme with its decent variety of gameplay modes.The arcade mode offers a variety of race types, including instant play, road challenge, free race, time attack, and cop chase. The instant play mode throws you into a random car on a random track in a random gameplay mode, no questions asked. The road challenges are a series of races against artificial intelligence opponents that are divvied up by class, and the free race is similar, though it's just a single race in which you can choose from any of the cars and race on any of the nine tracks in the game. Time attack takes out the other racers and the ambient street traffic, pitting you against the clock.The cop chase mode is kind of like the classic Atari arcade game A.P.B., except in 3D. In a souped-up sports-car-cum-cop-car, your goal is to chase down a number of escaping cars before time runs out. All you have to do is line up behind the perp and keep him within the targeting overlay on your screen for a few seconds, and he'll automatically pull over. It sounds simple enough, but unfortunately the control in Asphalt isn't precise enough and the tracks are often curvy, which makes it exceedingly difficult to keep the cars in your sight long enough to pull them over. It's a good enough idea, but most rounds usually just end in frustration.If you're looking for something a little bit bigger in scope than just a handful of races, the evolution mode gives you a garage and a series of race challenges in which you can win cash and cars. You can also go to car dealers and buy new cars, or buy performance- and aesthetic-based upgrades.The game also features Wi-Fi multiplayer support for up to four players. You can choose a single race--in which you define what tracks you race on and what class of cars you race in--or you can go into the championship mode and select from a variety of race series in which the cars and tracks are already defined. The cop chase mode is also playable over Wi-Fi, though because of its cat-and-mouse mechanics, it's limited to two players. In all, the multiplayer functionality is pretty good, despite having a few quirks. Regardless of which mode you're in, all of the nonracing street traffic is missing. Also, there is no way to limit the classes of cars that players can choose from, giving players who have unlocked more cars a distinct advantage.It doesn't really take great advantage of many of the features that make the DS unique, but Asphalt is still fundamentally an enjoyable arcade-style racer, regardless of the platform. The gameplay is fast and accessible, and there's enough variety in both the single- and multiplayer modes that you could spend a lot of time with the game.",1381,0,,-1,"No mention of other reviews or opinions, therefore:  **No mention of other reviews or opinions.**"

281,816446,2004-08-19,GeoAbraxas,Hellraiser: Inferno (2000 Video),8.0,"I've just gotten into these movies over the past few months and really this may as well be the best of all the Hellraiser films. 3 and 4 were great movies just based on Pinhead's lines alone although they were over the top (in the bad way) and the acting was about as bad as one could get. 1 & 2 are horror classics in every sense of the word and Inferno resembles those two films more then the two that came before it.Inferno has one major fault, the protagonist is one of the most unlikable, uncharismatic characters to grace a leading role, it's not hard to notice his lack of anything closely resembling a personality; thankfully the supporting cast are all more realistic and bring some warmth and color to the film.The best things about this movie are it's story and what most people look for in a Hellraiser movie, the Cenobites. The story is not really that hard to figure out but it is among the best in the series, at its core it's a crime thriller with occult/horror overtones, kinda like what you would expect for the X-files, but well...better. The Cenobites present in this film are much better then any found in the Hellraiser series with the possible exception of the original 4, the makeup and CG are well done.Overall I'd give this film an 8, solid story and acting only offset by a brick wall of a lead character. Pinhead is present in all his former glory that would be found in the original film, his lack of screen time in no way reduces the quality of the film in fact it makes it better.",280,0,,0,No reference

283,883743,2005-01-12,tinkerbelllcf,Dawn Anna (2005 TV Movie),3.0,"I was very disappointed with Dawn Anna. I have been an avid Columbine researcher for nearly a year or so now and was highly looking forward to this movie. I almost feel horrible saying the movie was bad simply because it was all true events and tragic nonetheless. So, before I begin, I think the story itself is fascinating and inspiring, but it came across weak in this movie.The story is Dawn Anna is a single mother of four terrific kids who is in desperate need of a job. So, in less than ten minutes, she gets one as a teacher. And five minutes from that, she decides to be the volleyball coach after meeting nice guy Bink, who wants to take her out to dinner and in no time, they're an official couple. The kids seem to warm up to him quickly except one, but a sudden turn of events puts that on hold. Dawn Anna discovers (after tumbling around in school and forgetting things easily) that she has some sort of brain tumor and it needs to be removed via opening the skull. So, in the span of fifteen minutes, Dawn is checked by a doctor, a diagnosis is made, she attempts to have it removed one way (which fails), then she has to official surgery and gets it removed.From there, we see that after the surgery, Dawn is unable to speak or walk. So, the kids and Bink (they all like him now) take it as their responsibility to help her. She learns to speak and walk in roughly fifteen more minutes after going through physical therapy and reading flashcards. She's finally allowed to go home and Bink finally proposes to her. Some evening a few days after (or seconds, depending on who's time your on), Dawn is tucking in her daughter Lauren, who up until now wasn't the main focus whatsoever, and we zip up to five years later (1999). Lauren is now the only child still living at home. All of a sudden, Lauren becomes a more interesting character and a larger focal point. We're now about an hour an fifteen minutes into the movie.After a brief subplot of Lauren's sister getting engaged and Lauren having an extremely weird discussion with her mother (which is thrown in there simply to show the relationship between them, I believe), we get to the Columbine story. After Lauren is dropped off at her school, a young man is wearing a Columbine jacket, which is the first we hear about what school officially she attends. A commercial break occurs with police sirens in the fade out. Once we understand what is going on, Dawn rushes home to watch the news stories in bewilderment (these are real news casts from the event as well). The family gathers around and victims advocates come to the house to get information on her daughter. They announce her daughter is a victim on TV the next day and make it official. This all happens in ten minutes. We spend no time worrying for her daughter or seeing the growing panic in the household because we're running out of time. The film ends with the family trying to get back on their feet and Dawn becoming a public speaker on gun control. She ends by going to visit Lauren's grave (which also looks exactly like the real Lauren Townsend's grave up close, so I think it probably is, but the crane shot doesn't look like the real cemetery). The film is dedicated to the lives lost at Columbine even though we barely spend any time thinking about it and we don't even seem to care about Lauren until the film is more than half over.I thought the story was just a jumble of events. They didn't follow any distinct direction except the ""Let's just throw in one bad thing after another to show how this woman can overcome it all."" The character development just wasn't there. I've studied the real Dawn Anna and her daughter, Lauren Townsend, for some time now, and I can say that both were and are remarkable women. Debra Winger is also a terrific actress who is often underrated. I was just disappointed with how both the acting and the story didn't compliment each other. It seems like the movie was under such pressure to stuff everything into just two hours that we didn't have time to even discuss where the real father was, the marriage between Bink and Dawn, or Lauren being an extremely scholarly student (she was named Valedictorian posthumously at her graduation). If this film had been made into a two part series or even a mini series, I think it would have been much more effective and we could have gotten a lot more story-line. Unfortunately, I don't believe Debra Winger's talents were used to their fullest potential and I don't believe the story of Dawn Anna and her daughter was of remote interest the way it was told.",832,0,,0,No reference
284,727869,2004-02-12,Chris Knipp,Choses secrètes (2002),,"[S P O I L E R S]Either because they were too shocking, or too bad, or just too French, Jean-Claude Brisseau's previous nine films (some just done for TV) haven't made it to the US. Choses secrètes (Secret Things) is having some limited distribution here. The film seduces initially with its intelligence and its elegant look; then it betrays us with tendentiousness, tedium, and numbing excess.  If you loved Luchino Visconti's The Damned or Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò, you will have to see this.  If you respected Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, you may want to consider Choses secrètes, which some think does its moral consideration of sex and its orgy scenes better.Whereas Dangerous Liaisons (the Choderlos de Laclos classic as well as its various film adaptations) involves the plot of a man and a woman to demolish a powerful and wicked female, this film involves two women out to get men in general. Brisseau's Nathalie (Coralie Revel), a stripper, coaches Sandrine (Sabrina Seyvecou), a barmaid, on how they can both become powerful through exploiting their own sexual daring. They've just been fired - literally thrown out on the street - from the club where they both work for refusing to have sex with customers afterward. Nathalie persuades the naïve, penniless Sandrine to move in with her and next day outlines her plan for the two of them to conquer the Paris business world.This is all to be done through sex, and from scene one, there's plenty of masturbation  -- orgasms, real or faked, come as often as explosions in action flicks -- and plenty of nudity, but only female in each case. Nathalie's simplistic, rather old-fashioned rule is that if they can give themselves pleasure, they need never be enslaved to any man.  The typically French rationality of Nathalie's exposition of her plan undercuts the obvious softcore aspects of the film - for a while, that is.
And so does Choses secrètes' splendid appearance: the beauty of the two young women is set off by handsome cinematography and a generous use of sumptuous, richly colored drapery that makes the décor a pleasure to look at.  One wishes American filmmakers could generate effects of taste and elegance with such simple means.  But there is more to cinema than the visuals and this movie begins to seem little more than a Vogue shoot.Wilder and prettier:  that's the two girls' selling point.  On the strength of a certain provocative appeal, we're to believe, they're hired at a major financial corporation, Nathalie in personnel, Sandrine in the top administrative office. Again the film's seductive:  the sudden rise may be far fetched, but you want to see what happens.Sandrine follows Nathalie's instructions and rejects a younger executive who wants to marry her:  a big mistake; but she sticks to the program. Instead of dating the sincere young man, Sandrine seduces Delacroix, the firm's married, bored fifty-year-old (but handsome and lean) manager.  Delacroix falls hopelessly in love. Sandrine fakes everything.  Nathalie ignores her own rules and has a secret lover who hurts her.  We have to guess who he is; but it's not hard: we know that Christophe (Fabrice Deville), the aged, ill boss's son, who's heir to the corporate fortune, is a gorgeous seducer who's literally driven women to commit suicide right before his eyes - and enjoyed watching.  Christophe has a preposterous back-story to explain his moral emptiness.Things go rapidly downhill when this monster of evil begins to dominate the scene.  It doesn't help that the slightly corpulent Christophe looks more like last year's model than a real person.  Looks and sound effects have started to take over Choses secrètes at this point. There haven't been such scenes of elegant depravity since Visconti.  But there are too many orgies with Bach and Vivaldi masses played at top volume for background. It's over the top: the film self-destructs before one's eyes.  And the old-fashioned moral tale - replete with blatant titillation over the `hell' it depicts - morphs into an increasingly tedious and surreal scenario.  There's an angel of annihilation, a face transfixed by death, a bird of prey pecking at a bleeding chest:  we're on the wilder fringes of the French imagination. Cocteau did this sort of thing much better.In a final scene several years later Nathalie and Sandrine, now on separate paths, have a brief final meeting.  One has a wholesome life and the other has become a pampered princess:  using a stretch limo to suggest the latter's wealth was a genuinely bad idea.  Both women look exactly the same as ever:  like this year's models.  The movie has completely disintegrated. There is nothing left to care about.But I did love the drapery in Nathalie's bedroom.  It promised better things.For an infinitely smarter and ultimately more chic French film about love games, if you don't want to go to the source, de Laclos' Dangerous Liaisons and its film versions, rent a copy of Benoît Jacquot's School of Flesh (L'École de la chair), with  Isabelle Huppert at her most sublimely disdainful.  Nathalie and Sandrine combined aren't fit to dust her shoes.",848,0,,0,No reference

Twenty Bucks is one of the most creative ideas ever made into a movie and will definitely earn a few laughs for the writing alone.  While there is no one main character here, the story revolves around a twenty dollar bill.  The movie opens as the money enters circulation, and ends when it is mangled and ready to be burned.  The life of the money is the story of the movie, and it's just delightful!  As it changes hands from one person to the next, it has a profound impact on some people, and no impact on others.  At times, it appears that it is a good luck charm, and at others a curse sent from God. Steve Buscemi, Brendan Fraser, Gladys Knight, Elizabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, and William H. Macy all get their hands on the money, and there are several others as well.Apparently, this screenplay was written several years ago by Andre Bohem and nothing was ever done with it.  After quite a long period of time, Andre's son Leslie got ahold of the script and modernized it a bit, and the end result is magnificent!  While there aren't any acting performances here that are going to melt your hearts, each star is really enjoyable to watch in one way or another.  The casting director did a fantastic job of lining up so many recognizable faces, and I found it hilarious that the stripper at the bachelor party (Melora Walters), also played the funeral director near the end of the movie!  I knew I had seen her face somewhere before and couldn't see it until I saw the credits.  When I realized they were the same person, I busted out laughing, and yet was still able to see the incredible irony of the whole situation.If you are watching this because you like one of the actors, then you very well could be disappointed by what you see.  No one of the actors here has a tremendous amount of screen time, but all are quite good to watch.

It's flat, boring, kind of a copy of that other teenager movie that was released recently that seemed almost identical to this one, of which the name i don't even remember and don't bother to check it on another tab of my browser (this is how worthless i consider it). they should make a movie from time to time about how story tellers burn out and serve such a timewaster, and marketing guys, and critics (possibly lobbied (you noticed how i used work ""lobbied"", yes that a nice word, politically correct;)- otherwise how such movie could get graded over 3/10).1.5hour of my life i'll never get back.just go watch something you've already seen before, let it be LOTR, Tears of the sun, Married with Children episode, or just take nice evening walk, you'll at least have a chance to enjoy the time, not like i had with this ... moving picture. its all you can call it",253,1,,0,No reference
290,2722856,2014-09-07,braddugg,Uyyala Jampala (2013),6.0,"Happy to have caught this film while it is theaters. I liked it's many moments and it is surely recommended.This film is a simple subject, with nativity filled and some emotions which can strike a chord. It thus gives a winner. The subject is age-old and indeed now Telugu Industry seems to be running out of new subjects and are trying to give us old-wine in new bottles. But who cares, as long as the wine is good. So, we have a film whose subject is old but the treatment is refreshing and it's very simplified. I must say, this actor Raj Tarun would go a long way if he is careful in choosing films and does not fall prey to the predator called ""Telugu Film Industry"". He has done exceedingly well as Soori, and the way he displayed some emotions are wonderful. His slang suits the dialect of the film and he seems effortless in dialog delivery. We have a bunch of those film actors sons or relatives who struggle to complete a sentence and here we have a very unknown face who seems to be saying dialogs as fast as he can. In fact, it was tough for me to catch up with his pace.Avika Gor has done a good job as Uma Devi, I just wish that she was told the feeling well rather than merely asking for an expression. I felt her expressions were not apt at certain moments and were out of place. But overall, she has done a fine job in emoting wherever needed. I loved one scene where she decided to take rounds as Soori breaks coconuts. She runs so fast just to reach a point to see Soori and then on walks slowly. She did it wonderfully, though there was very little to do in this specific scene.Among many technical aspects, the best part in the film is casting. Every small character is played out well. So, more than half of job was done by selecting the right actors. Kudos to the casting department of this. My second biggest thumbs up is to the cinematography and I will have to contact the cinematographer Vishwa D B to say, man you have done a remarkable job. I need to learn so many things from you. I have a few reservations in editing as I feel, a few scenes might have been kept out but since this film in itself is of two hours, I have reservations and no big qualms. The music I wish was used more aptly. The one song I loved which is the title song is ill-timed, I wished there could have been a better way to create the mood of this wonderful song. The music and background score were OK, and I will have to watch it again if I were to judge. The theater, kept the background so heavy that I missed out on lyrics for songs as only the music was heard. The director who is also the writer has done a commendable job in treating this story with simplicity and with no over the top scenes or acts. Love in fact is one of the most abstract and a highly complex feeling which cannot be conveyed very simply, it's an emotion that needs a heart more than mind or words. This film surely has that very heart in the right place. I thanks the producers who have the film it's due in getting it released in considerable number of screens. Also, I hope it does not get lost in the frenzy of the upcoming big films. If it stays there in halls despite the flood, then surely Telugu Film Industry can hope for good days. Should this be taken down, then the drought shall continue as film audience like me will keep avoiding Telugu Films, coz good films are not adequately encouraged.So there you have it, there are many good things that you can see the movie for. From the first recording dance sequence to the last marriage scene, there are many fun moments that go with the flow of the script. Yet, I am not sure if this can be watched many times over as it has nothing great or new to offer. For that reason, I am going with a 3/5. I liked it for sure.Please go see in theaters and do encourage good cinema which seems to be a rarity in a garbage called Telugu Film Industry.",744,0,,0,No reference

292,3267975,2017-04-01,Imdbidia,Hardcore Henry (2015),7.0,"Hardcore Henry is truly a fun and full-on breathless movie that will delight both action-movie lovers and video-gamers. This film is like a role-playing video-game. The main features of those games are that the player controls the hero character's actions and movements, the player sees through the main character's eyes, the character has a dangerous mission to carry out, the enemies are violent and have to be avoided and/or fought with more violence, and the mission is carried out in a hostile semi-desolated militarized world. In this film, we 'are' Harry and we see what is happening through his eyes, as if Harry's eyes were ours.The movie is action-packed, very violent and gory at times, raunchy and cheeky, but all of that is counterbalanced by a great dose of humour and hilarious moments that light the overall tone of the film. Besides, the movie doesn't take itself seriously, so it is one of those films that you enjoy fully present with a giant bag of pop-corn on your lap. The film production is very good and, as you can expect, action scenes are excellent. One of the trademarks of this film is the predominance of red and dark-gray colors, something that reflects the tone of the story; however, also here, those are balanced and toned down by some of the green exterior scenes. Tim Roth, in his tiny role as Henry's father; Danila Kozlovsky, as the evil powerful Akan and, above all, Sharlto Copley as the multiple Jimmy, are great in their roles. Although the film is very entertaining and fun, it is also underdeveloped. It lacks something that is very important to good video-games: the introductory presentation. In this intro, the player is offered a mini-short with the background: who the characters are, especially the leading hero; why they are there, what lead to the start of the game, the nature and aim of the mission, and so on. This provides a narrative framework that makes the experience more enjoyable. Unfortunately, this film does not have that sort of intro, not bothers to present viewers with any sort of complexity, so the plot is weak and insubstantial and the characters hollow. And those are the main flaws of the film.",371,0,,0,No reference

Moira's imagination goes into overtime as her husband's name is Donald (Michael Craig) & he too had been in Paris the previous weekend supposedly on work commitments, could Moira have inadvertently discovered that her husband is in fact cheating on her & what is she going to do about it?This Tales of the Unexpected story was episode 2 from season 5 & originally aired here in the UK during May 1982, the seventh of eleven Tales of the Unexpected episodes to be directed by John Gorrie this is OK but nothing particularly special. The story by Ruth Wissman was dramatised by Robin Chapman & I suppose is a morality tale about not jumping to conclusions, the dangers of paranoia & to not listen in on other people's conversation's. This one isn't that predictable as it could go either way, perhaps Moira is right & perhaps she isn't & you don't find out until the very end. It moves along at a decent pace at only 25 odd minutes in length & is watchable if nothing else. The twist at the end is alright & it's a neat enough little story, it's just that it's a tad forgettable & nothing special.This one looks OK although hasn't dated too well as with many episodes from this cheaply produced show. There's no scares, suspense or tension in this one & relies on it's basic story to interest & entertain. The acting is OK & I can't believe Michael Craig is in this, he would go on to star in the Australian exploitation flick Turkey Shoot (1982) which is an absolute favourite of mine. It's amazing who turns in these things, it really is.The Eavesdropper is a decent enough time waster, it won't change your life or anything but at least it's watchable if nothing else.",354,0,,0,No reference

The main survivor of the first film is abducted and brought to an abandoned orphanage, in order to break a curse from beyond the grave. However, the team ends up resurrecting the ghost of the former owner, who was burned to death by the orphan kids. The movie has some nice references to THE EXORCIST and the first two EVIL DEAD films and doesn't shy away from moments of delirious horror, blood and gore, so it is highly recommended. The director has a lot of talent and love for the genre and -for me- this film is much better than the other two Indonesian horror movies released this year (IMPETIGORE and the reboot film THE QUEEN OF BLACK MAGIC). Horror fans with a taste for the bloody&macabre should definitely give it a try. My favorite tagline from the movie : the 'Satani Levitas!' spell.

295,2456405,2013-05-05,FilmFanatic03,Oblivion (I) (2013),6.0,"Referencing to the Tom Cruise canon, Oblivion is a stronger effort than Jack Reacher. Mr. Cruise can still make taking down the bad guys look cool, however this is not his finest hour yet it is far from his worst. Oblivion has an eerie and beautiful feeling in regards to the scenery and visuals. The whole production design was sophisticated and had a crisp feel to it. Overall however, I feel that Oblivion had the potential to be a strong outing for Joseph Kosinski yet the third act did not deliver. The film starts out as a simplistic and imposing, Jack Harper (Cruise) feels a strange connection with planet earth and has doubts about migrating to Titan with Victoria (Riseborough) How the film dealt with Harper's connection with a planet lost from the grasp of hope and life allowed me to engage with the film. Yet, the second half of the film felt like it escalated at a quite rapid pace and the conclusion felt slightly rushed. Oblivion should have stayed with its personal and raw approach rather than levelling it up to a hashed conclusion. The action is not being criticised, but it should have been dealt with a more steady pace. Apart from that, Oblivion is a decent sic-fi which does provide some form of excitement. Focusing on the positives, the soundtrack gave Oblivion a sense of depth and the potential for the film to be epic.Oblivion is far from a disaster, it's just failed to reach for the heights of an epic sic-fi blockbuster.",257,0,,0,No reference

297,91565,1999-08-14,baumer,The Haunting (1999),2.0,"Warning: may contain some spoilers.But this film has been spoiled.  This film was terrible.  I was so looking forward to The Haunting.  But once again film makers forget what is so obvious to the rest of us, that it is disgusting and repulsive, and that is the fact that very few people know how to make a terrifying film.  Very few people understand the craft and skill behind it.  Because I can honestly count on two hands the films that scared me, or at least left me filled with tension.  So in the history of film there has been about 1000 horror movies made and I have probably seen about 3/4 of them, how come only ten or so can truly scare?  The reason is because most film makers know that a scary film has to have atmoshphere, tension, a good script, perhaps music, lighting or lack thereof ( Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Blair Witch Project ) and a director who knows how to use the camera so that it uses us.  The Haunting has none of that.  The Haunting is filled with lots of loud noises, a non scary entity that shows itself at the end of the film, possessed statues, sheets that move by themselves and every other trick that should make a film like this good.  But what it needs it better camera work, even a little bit of tension and hey, how about a scare or two.  The Haunting contains none of that.  This is one of the biggest disappointments of the summer.  So here is my advice to Jan DeBont.  Whoever directed the trailer, get some pointers from them.  And get Linda Hunt to do some voice over work for the film as well, she had me glued to my seat with anticipation in the trailer ( these are its eyes ).  It's funny too, because Jan De Bont was a DP before he hit it big with Speed.  And one of the films that he was DP for was Cujo.  Now Cujo was a good horror film, not the best, but pretty good.  It's too bad that he couldn't learn from someone even like Lewis Teague, because any effort besides this one would have been better.  This is a disgrace to horror films and even as a film itself it is terrible.  You want to be scared this summer?  Go see Blair Witch and Sixth Sense.  You want to waste two hours?

It's both brilliantly cerebral and mind bogglingly complex. But the movie tightly tells the complex story in 90 minutes, without sacrificing any nuance. It's one of the few movies that I can say I instantly knew I was going to buy the blu-ray right after the credits rolled. Among the many impressive aspects to the story, is the story-telling structure. It feels equally part Nolan and Kubrickian, with a bit of a David Lynch/David Fincher vibe mixed in. However most importantly, Predestination feels like an original film bolstered by performances from the always great Ethan Hawke, as well as the career making turn from Sarah Snook. The depths both of them take their roles, but particularly Snook, is fascinating. And surprisingly neither of them were considered for Oscar noms in 2015.

Getting himself into many scrapes on account of his feelings for Judalon, Bowie invents a new kind of Knife, the Iron Mistress, and from here a legend is born.Nobody should go into this picture expecting a Jim Bowie biography, in fact Western fans who haven't seen it should be advised that it barely registers as a Western piece. What it is, is a fine picture that certainly appears to be undervalued {if a little under seen} on the IMDb site. It's full of dandy men fighting and duelling with honour and guts, beautiful women that are surely worth fighting for, and of course it introduces us to the legendary Bowie Knife.It's based on a Paul Wellman novel, and by all accounts the film is pretty loyal to Wellman's ideals, it doesn't however take us all the way to the Alamo. Alan Ladd takes the lead role of Bowie, shiny blonde hair and brooding for all he is worth, fans of his performance in Shane should definitely check this one out, it's a great performance from Ladd, the kind that makes the gals go gooey and the boys to thump their chests. Virginia Mayo is Judalon and positively simmers with sexual beauty, the character is akin to a viper, and the pot boiling sexual tension is palpable in the extreme, she is in short, a woman men will die for.Some scenes are just terrific, a duel in a darkened room that is only lit by the odd flash of lightning thru a window, a knife fight as two men with one arm tied to each other face off in a circle of honour, and of course Jim Bowie in every encounter, his violent gutsy bravado fearsome as his reputation escalates. At the time of writing only 141 people have voted on this picture, only 10 people have bothered to write a user comment for it, that's a shame because although it may not be a Western as such, it's a damn fine romantic, dandy, drama with a Western legend at its core. 8/10",376,1,undervalued,1,Reference to other reviews

There are dizzying jump cuts,the sound effects are repetitive,and the actresses in this film seem to look very dirty and quite sad,which was probably their motivation,the film if you would call it that has strong misogynistic undertones and Valentine has fun making their actors' voices from normal to reverse,maybe after trying to turn his records backwards he tries to prove his lines might say something demonic..but it loses its purpose and gets annoying,there isn't much good diologue in this film and if it does,its about the girl's making themselves vomit,again addressing the camera and the difficulty of hearing the women talk because Lucifer slows down their voices.There's a sad scene when Angela played by""Ameara Lavey""incoherently tells a story when she was 13 she set fire to a church.We hear lots of strange sounds in the soundtrack that might probably be the boom operator scratching the boom mike across a wall or pots and pans being hit together.

Blanchett as usual is perfect, but for some reason, this just doesn't strike me as a role for her. Ribisi, who speaks flawless Italian, proves he can also be the leading man.

No one knows how or why, but he falls for Blanchett's character and goes to great pains to help her. An unusual love story.",179,0,,0,No reference
316,1753405,2009-01-17,meeza,Revolutionary Road (2008),8.0,"Director Sam Mendes' suburbia melancholy tic is still ticking with his latest subversive (synonym of revolutionary) film ""Revolutionary Road"". The film is not really a revolutionist one as it is a sinister one; sinister in the sense of marriage peccadillo. Mendes brings us the usual no-no's of marriage that have been mores in the matrimony world in the last few decades: adultery, deceit, lies, dissatisfaction, and escapism. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as Frank & April Wheeler, a young married couple with two kids living in a Connecticut suburb in the mid 1950's. Frank Wheeler unenthusiastically just goes with the motion in his mundane office job living paycheck by paycheck. April Wheeler is a stay-at-home mom and part-time amateur actress who longs for more than the life she is living. Therefore, a Wheeler Revolution must occur! So they decide to move to Paris. They inform their archetypal suburban married neighbors (and best friends) Shep and Milly Campbell of their Tour de France plans; The Campbells think it is all talk soup, even with their stunned expressions. That scene is probably the elite one the film. The Wheeler's revolutionary Paris road plans come to a dead end when Frank gets an unexpected promotion and the zenith of the Wheeler Marriage Civil War begins. ""Revolutionary Road"" should not be part of an itinerary for a Marriage Retreat because most of the film shows the Wheelers emotionally bickering about various contrived sentiments and psychological conflicts. DiCaprio and Winslet's titanic performances are Oscar worthy; but Winslet wins out between the two. Nevertheless, my favorite performance of the film was Michael Shannon's scene-stealing work as John Gibins, the mentally troubled son of the Wheeler's real estate confidante Helen Gibins. Shannon portrays John Gibins as a real straight shooter who fires emotional verbal blows to the Wheelers which get them off track in saving their marriage. I hope the Academy does shadow my Shannon sentiment by giving him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kathy Bates is ""gibin"" us some more fine acting in the twilight of her career with her solid work as Helen Gibins. Justin Haythe's screenplay based on Richard Yates ""Revolutionary Road"" novel gives the best-seller literary work a respectful proper credence. You gotta have Haythe in your promising screenwriter list. Roger Deakins' astounding cinematography should garner him yet another Oscar nomination; copy that Roger. But let's divert back to Sam the Man! Mendes, Mr. Kate Winslet himself, admirably continues to direct stories on marriage tribulations that cause eventual destruction on many psychological effects on a couple and those close around. He did it proficiently with ""American Beauty"" and does an encore with it in ""Revolutionary Road""; even though I thought Beauty was superior to Road. When you first cinematically drive through ""Revolutionary Road"" it seems like just a mediocre movie ride; but before you could say ""mental revolution"" it does linger in your mind for a few days and that is a prominent sign of a powerful film. Follow your movie G.P.S. and take a ride through ""Revolutionary Road"". **** Good",510,0,,0,No reference

This one has Bond battling an evil organization, known as SPECTRE, as well as corrupt political forces. It was directed by Sam Mendes (who also helmed the last Bond flick, 'SKYFALL') and it was written by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Jez Butterwort. The movie costars Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Dave Bautista, Andrew Scott and Monica Bellucci. It's not quite as good as 'SKYFALL' or 'CASINO ROYALE', but it is one of the better Bond films (throughout the franchise's history).James Bond (Craig) is on a special mission, given to him by the deceased M (Judi Dench), before she died, to track down a ruthless organization known as SPECTRE. He's relieved from duty, by his new superior, the new M (Fiennes), but travels to Rome anyway; in pursuit of the terrorist organization. Bond finds aid from former allies, Q (Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Harris), while also falling for the daughter of a previous enemy, named Dr. Madeline Swann (Seydoux). Bond also finds lethal opposition, from the head of SPECTRE, Franz Oberhauser (Waltz), and his deadly henchman, Mr. Hinx (Bautista). At the same time there's a political struggle, between the new M and the new head of the Joint Intelligence Service, called C (Scott); who wants to eliminate the '00' program.The movie cost between $245 and $300 million to make, and it's reportedly one of the most expensive films ever made; you can see nearly every dollar of it up on screen though! The action scenes are breathless and geniuslly done. I really like Bautista as Mr. Hinx; I think he's probably the best Bond goon since Richard Kiel, as Jaws. At times the film even feels a lot like 'THE SPY WHO LOVED ME'. The romance, of the film, is completely unbelievable though (even for a Bond movie) and Seydoux was severely miscast as a Bond girl (her and Craig have absolutely no chemistry together). I wish Bellucci (the oldest actress ever cast as a Bond girl, at 51) didn't have such a small part.

It's just so terrible! I've always loved Bones (and have binged the series many times), but I've come to the point where I can't just sit back and shut up about this. The portrayal of Norwegians, Metalheads and the likes in this episode is disgusting and offensive, and it makes me wonder how many other countries, cultures, and sub-cultures they've offended throughout the years, because I can't think this is the only time they've done this. First off, in the opening when the ""policeman"" (aka SWAT - which doesn't actually exist in Norway) and the ""detective"" are speaking, the ""detective"" barely speaks Norwegian at all, and it made me cringe so hard. Yes we have a lot of dialects in Norway, but that is not a Norwegian dialect, it's like hearing an English speaker trying to say a Norwegian sentence for the first time (Like Brennan trying to say 'skalle', and mispronouncing it terribly). Oh and btw, all the ""detective's"" lines sounds like they've been translated with a beta-version of google translate. At least get a Norwegian actor if you're going to represent another country, like the ""SWAT leader"".Now to the ""SWAT leader"" or whatever the hell they're supposed to be anyway, I'm happy he's actually Norwegian, but that doesn't weigh up for the terrible acting and totally horrid misrepresentation of our law enforcement. You seriously don't need ""SWAT"" to storm into a metal concert in any country, a few cops and some security guys would have been enough (not that even that would have been needed, but if they really wanted to make it look dramatic that would have at least made it look plausible), and 95% of the folks there would have had no problem calming down and allowing the police to do their job. Also storming a concert with SWAT is just plain stupid. I don't care that this is fiction and all, it still pisses me off. (Also any comments made about our police is disgusting, they make it sound like we should have more murders, that our police ""need more practice"" and that they're incompetent at doing their job.) I could probably rant about the totally stereotypical portrayal of Norwegians as well, but you get my point.So, over to the portrayal (both in description from the team and visually) of ""metalheads"", it's so cliché that I wanted to bang my head into the wall 60% of the episode. It's like the entire concept of metal, and any sub-genre of it, the producers and directors have, is from their own time as teens back in the late 70's and throughout the 80's, and from some select myspace pages (which was at the time of this episode's release (2009), almost a dead platform) which the producers and directors apparently wasn't aware of. Also if offending was their goal with this episode, they definitely did it with the whole satanic thing, and the ""all metalheads loves gore, death and destruction"". If it's still unclear for you, yes I find this disgusting and offensive, not just because they're using the most idiotic stereotypes, but also because they paint the picture to outsiders that metalheads (or anyone belonging to that sub-culture) should be regarded with caution, that they're prone to violence and that they lack any respect for anything and anyone. Also that all of them/us are depressed, misguided and/or ""freaks"". And what the hell is up with that make-up/face-paint all the time? No one does that any more. Yes it was popular once, in the 80's and early 90's!I'm sorry, but anyone saying this was a good episode, have to have had rose-tinted glasses on. The rest of the episode (the 40% I didn't want to bash my head in) was at the scenes with Sweets and his story development, and the ones with Gordon.

But, a promise he made to his daughters twenty years ago, to bring the novel Mary Poppins to the screen, has been a big thorn in his side. No matter how he has approached or wooed the author, Brit P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) she has refused to sign over the rights. But, things change. Her money is running out and she does love her beautiful house and amenities. Therefore, this crabby lady finally agrees to come to Los Angeles and meet with Disney himself. When she arrives, she is met by a very personal limo driver (Paul Giamatti) but she shows him no warmth. Nor does the hotel room, filled with Disney stuffed animals, change her attitude. Most of the creatures go in a closet, while Mickey Mouse has to sit in the corner. At the studio, the celebrated composers Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert Sherman are targets of her unpleasantness, as are all of the other staff members. Just why is this dame so contrary, when everyone is rolling out the bright red carpet? In flashback, the viewer learns of her difficult, unstable childhood in Australia. Especially sad is her relationship with her father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell), who sparked her imagination, when he wasn't drinking and losing jobs. In addition, he dies young and the children are subjected to stuffy Aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths). What will it take to please Miss Travers and get her name on the dotted line? For all movie fans who love the terrific Disney classic, Mary Poppins, here is the tale of how it almost never got made! Ms. Travers was one witch-on-wheels whose demands were only exceeded by her horrible disposition. Yes, she had a difficult childhood, which explains but does not excuse her perpetual coldness. Only Emma Thompson could bring her to life with some small saving graces. The rest of the cast, too, is superb, with Hanks, Griffiths, Giamatti, Schwartzman, and company doing a fantastic job. Especially noteworthy is Farrell; never has he been so touching or polished.

This stars Hollywood icon Charlton Heston, who was on a roll during this period(late 60's/early70's) with one dystopian science fiction classic after another. The Omega Man is by far the most action packed of the lot. Charlton Heston is the last man on Earth, he rolls around town in style with a muscle car and submachine gun. In this post apocalyptic action classic the population of the world was wiped out by a plague caused by biological warfare. Those who have survived are albino mutants known as The Family who are nocturnal and shun technology and blame technology for destroying the world. Which puts our hero Neville(Heston), man of science on their hit list. Heston fortunately has a well balanced gun collection and usually handles his intruders with ease. He does find another group of uninfected survivors which includes foxy lady Rosalind Cash, who was a fine piece of dark chocolate and sexy mamma. Heston and Cash get down and broke taboos of interracial relationships for the time period.(Or at least their characters did in the film) As far as I am concerned The Omega Man has pretty much nothing not to like about it. It is well made, well acted , nicely shot and filled with social commentary, action and one liners. The Omega Man is action packed, thought provoking and at times funny. While Charlton Heston was one of the best actors to have ever lived and had success in many different genres, he is in my opinion best in science fiction and The Omega Man is essential and a classic.",286,0,,0,No reference

And it's not fully deserving of that. In a way, the reaction to this movie was fairly reflective of 2020. We didn't get what we wanted, so we complained.This one is a bit different from its predecessor. And if you go watch the interview the director did with IGN, you'll understand why. DC/WB made a lot of the big scenes mandatory in the first WW. She wanted to tone it down a bit for this one and show more of the human side of the character.In a way, it has some elements of the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman film series and other 1980's superhero movies/shows. The hero who constantly feels out of place, someone they meet becomes the villain, and the villain is just a nobody who becomes a somebody.The ending of the intro sets the stage for the film. Diana has to learn a lesson as a girl, which will carry over into the future. The lesson that we don't always get what we want, and lying doesn't help the cause. It's been almost 70 years since the first movie ends, and Diana has seemingly been covertly helping keep the bad guys in check. Nothing is said about what she did over that time span. She's learned new powers, but at the same time she is reserved and not as bold as in WW1.You have the 2 villains, who are both misfits of society who just want to be noticed. And they're willing to do whatever it takes for that to happen. And their lust for greed and power slowly overtakes them to the point they lose who they are. And the truth eventually gets to them.The battles are spread throughout the movie, instead of one major climatic battle to end it.The Steve Trevor side plot is weird and eventually boils down to helping Diana remember who she is supposed to be.

Also, a little confrontation about Britney Spears and adolescent female development implied that Lizzie needed to do a large number of sit-ups to achieve the right bust size to wear a somewhat revealing shirt.

Once in London, the duo live with friends and attempt to adjust to local customs.Early in ""Secret People"", Maria meets Louis (Serge Reggiani), a childhood sweetheart who works for a radical group intent on assassinating the unnamed dictator Maria's family has fled. This dictator is visiting British dignitaries, and so Louis requires Maria's assistance to smuggle a bomb into his presence. Maria thus finds herself torn between loyalty to her adopted homeland and loyalty to Louis' terrorist group. The film ends with Maria betraying Louis and admonishing those who would bring violence to the shores of a kindly, all inclusive, democratic nation like Great Britain. As Britain's long had ties to fascist regimes, as it has long operated fascist groups as the strong-arm of its ruling class, and as it specialises in backing terrorists, dictatorships, theocracies and far-right groups (everything from Mussolini to Charles Maxwell Knight, a proud fascist and wartime head of MI5), the film's creepy message reeks of hypocrisy.If ""Secret People"" has a bright spot, it's young Audrey Hepburn who twirls her way through Dickson's film like a ray of sunshine. Svelte and chirpy, Hepburn's role here would get her noticed by director William Wyler, who'd cast her in ""Roman Holiday"".

A blossoming poetess (Agnes Bruckner) and her sickly Miss America wannabe bestie (Kelli Garner) are both stirred by a newly arrived basketball protégé (Justin Long), which eventually creates conflict. Also on hand are a drug-addled ""boy toy"" (Brian Klugman), a father struggling with grief & alcoholism (John Corbett) and a couple musicians (Gina Gershon & Chris Mulkey). This is a subdued and mundane indie drama with beautiful New Mexican cinematography, a spiritual soundtrack and reverential tone. From the get-go it is pictorially established that the looming transmission towers represent the Fountain of Life (the Creator) and the healing powers thereof, which draw the physically, mentally or spiritually broken. The cast are at various stages of searching, lost-ness or suffering. One critic panned the film on the grounds that it seemed like ""Debbie Downer"" wrote the script, but this simply isn't accurate. Yes, there are some sad or foolish facts-of-life addressed, but there's something intangibly beautiful and transcendent going on behind the scenes throughout. Not every loose-end is tied up at the end, but the movie leaves you with a sense of hope. It also leaves you wondering.

353,2950843,2015-10-07,paul-allaer,Mississippi Grind (2015),6.0,"""Mississippi Grind"" (2015 release; 108 min.) brings the story of two gamblers. As the movie opens, we see how a guy (we later learn his name is Gerry) walks into a local casino in Dubuque, Iowa. He must be a regular as everyone knows him. But at his poker table, there is one new face, a younger guy named Curtis. Gerry is in real estate and way down on his luck. Curtis oozes charm and confidence. They bit it off nicely, and on a whim, decide to drive to New Orleans to enter into a 'big game' (buy-in price is $25K). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writers-directors (and real life partners) Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (they previously brought us ""It's Kind Of a Funny Story""). Here they tackle the subject matter of gambling, and more precisely the addition to gambling. Combine that with the road movie angle, and you've got yourself an update to ""California Split"" of yesteryear. That aside, the movie is really a character study. Gerry (played by Ben Mendelsohn) is someone who you feel sorry for, although he is not quite the 'loveable loser'. At one point he goes to visit his ex-wife in Little Rock, and you can just feel the devastation set in when he learns she has remarried and didn't even tell him. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as the confidence-oozing Curtis. ""You'll be my lucky charm"" Gerry tells Curtis as they hit the road to New Orleans. Sienna Miller is okay as the love interest of Curtis. As mentioned, this is a road movie, and we get the best scenery from cities like St. Louis, Memphis, Little Rock, etc. Kudos also for the outstanding soundtrack, which features tons of 'old school' blues artists and songs. All that said, the sum of the parts don't measure up to the total of the movie, which lacks the compelling elements needed to pull me in.""Mississippi Grind"" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend. The evening screening where I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, certainly for a week night. If you are in the mood for a character study about losers in life who are desperately trying to right the ship, ""Mississippi Grind"" isn't the best, but neither is it the worst.

With Tennant as ever giving a splendid performance as The Doctor, with honourable mentions going to Bernard Cribbins and Russell Tovey, there is nothing wrong with the performances in this episode. However, Russell T. Davies' style as a writer for Doctor Who is fairly tired now, and his clichés are all too recognisable now, and instead of being treated to a scary, intriguing ride, we are left with a fairly standard adventure which appears to outstay its welcome.In this adventure, The Doctor travels on a spaceship named the Titanic so that his TARDIS can recover from when it was unexpectedly hit by the aforementioned ship at the end of the previous series. Whilst travelling, The Doctor befriends a maid called Astrid (itself an anagram of Tardis), played delightfully by Kylie Minogue. He finds out that they are currently travelling several miles above the Earth. However, tragedy strikes when the Titanic is hit by three meteors and is headed straight towards the Earth. The Doctor then takes charge of a few survivors of the initial collision and resolves to take them to the Bridge of the ship, whilst avoiding a group of murderous robotic angels, known as the Host.This episode is definitely not without its moments, highlights including when The Doctor and Astrid visit London, only to find it completely deserted because people are afraid that there will be another alien attack at Christmas, following the attempted invasion of the Sycorax in ""The Christmas Invasion"" and the attack by the Empress of the Racnoss in ""The Runaway Bride"". But, other than this, there aren't many other outstanding moments, and, though you may be entertained, you may also be waiting for this episode to finish for a long time before the sneak preview of Series Four is actually shown at the end.",325,0,,0,No reference

Stan Laurel here plays a down-on-his-luck young man who is thrown out of his lodgings for not paying his rent. He is held up by a robber and twice narrowly avoids being run over by a tram. His only friend is a stray dog who befriends him. The dog, however, proves to be his lucky charm, as it is through the dog that he meets a dog-loving young lady. The dog also saves his life from the girl's jealous boyfriend who is plotting to blow him up with the assistance of the robber.There is nothing specially interesting about the film, which lacks the inventiveness and the slapstick brilliance of many silent shorts from this period, It has, however, become famous because of an accident of history. It was the first film to star both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, although they had not yet become a comedy partnership. In most of their films they play close friends, work colleagues or business partners, but here Ollie plays the robber who holds Stan up and later conspires with the jealous boyfriend. Had these two not gone on to become the famous duo of Laurel and Hardy, this film would doubtless today be forgotten.",231,0,,0,No reference

The bad guys are baaad with planet destroyers and everything.

I swear to god, I'm going to start an international petition to film-makers to stop using this technique. You can't see what's going on. No one likes it. It smacks of amateurishness on the part of the director (don't know how to shoot a good fight scene). Absolutely rubbish and frustrating for the audience who've spent a couple of hours waiting to see the hero do the violence on the bad guy, then find themselves getting sea-sick and wondering who's doing what to who. Only film I've seen recently where I thought it was effective was 'Master and Commander', as it suits the tightly packed, screaming mobs of merely human sailors fighting on a narrow deck.

It's the 50th anniversary and what a treat to see the re-mastered, restored film in a crowded theatre - many wearing their Beatles shirts. The quasi-documentary, cinema verite' approach from director Richard Lester may not fit the traditional idea of a great movie, but at a minimum, it's a fantastic pop culture artifact showing a world on the verge of change.This is The Beatles first film and this is the most innocent and fresh-faced we ever see them ... it's just a few months after their first appearance on ""the Ed Sullivan Show"". John is the most guarded, but his quick wit and distrust of the establishment are obvious. Paul is at his cutest and least arrogant, but still managing to pose on cue. George comes across most open and full of joy - before he became the most publicly withdrawn. Ringo is self-deprecating and in full hang-dog mode.For a stark contrast, watch the four lads a year later in HELP!, also directed by Mr. Lester. The luster of fame has clearly tarnished and they are quite aware of the power they wield. Still, during this shoot, we are almost ""on set"" as the boys are first experiencing Beatlemania! In addition to the Fab Four, British actor Wilfrid Brambill plays Paul's Grandfather. The recurring gag of him being ""very clean"" is a play on Brambill's long-running role as Albert Steptoe in ""Steptoe & Son"" where he is referred to as ""a dirty old man"". Victor Spinetti plays the very anxious TV director wearing the infamous sweater. Mr. Spinetti also appeared in HELP! (1965) and The Magical Mystery Tour (1967). Richard Vernon played the grumpy old man sharing the train car with the boys. Mr. Vernon also appeared in Goldfinger that same year. Another James Bond link occurs when Ringo is invited to the Le Cercle Club ... the same club James Bond first appears in Dr. No (1962). Lastly, Pattie Boyd is one of the giggly schoolgirls on the train and appears in 3 different scenes. 18 months later, she was married to George Harrison ... and a few years later, she proved her attraction to lead guitarists by marrying Eric Clapton.I was caught off guard by the frenetic pace of the film ... it has been 3 decades since I last watched it. But mostly, I was stunned at the clean look of this restored version and was awed by the terrific sound, especially of the song restorations completed by Giles Martin, the son of Beatles record producer George Martin ... who was nominated for an Academy Award for his film score.The film inspired the 1960's TV show ""The Monkees"", and of course, the soundtrack was a massive seller. ""If I Fell"" is one of my favorite Beatles songs and it's a nice segment in the film, but the real climax is the performance of ""She Loves You"", replete with terrific crowd shots.

Second sequel to much- loved Love Bug tale finds Herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too. There's a race, some lame bad guys, a diamond and Barney Fife.

The rest of film is a wreck. Prat falls, bumbling thieves, wicked German racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply. The biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop Herbie's lover personality via shakes, beeps, flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old, Disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little VW.

She cannot fail yet there are many obstacles in her way before she can succeed.Continuing the trend of Blackwatch films being clever, imaginative and fun, this film cleverly mixes styles and realities to comic effect where you're not sure which side of the film is real - but are enjoying it too much to care.  The plot jumps around between the holiday and the holiday as Molly sees it.  Some of it is clearly her imagination going wild, but other bits are very real in presentation.

She wants Mary back, but the Trust manages to bring her back to their orphanage on the Scottish isle of Bala. Police Colonel Bingham believes there's more to these deaths, and soon his trying to protect the Trust from Mary's mother who believes that they turned her daughter against her. Also pathologist Sir Mark Ashley and reporter Joan Foster start digging up some vital dirt, which could answer many questions. ""Nothing But the Night"" seems to fall more in the interesting bracket, than the successful one. Peter Sasdy's minor mystery chiller is a moderate attempt made more accessible due to the presence of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. It was actually produced under Lee's Charlemagne production company, and would be the last one too. These two icons of the genre can make anything watchable and even though they might not be as prominent here. They still have the ability to leave their mark when they aren't on screen. Brain Hayles' cryptic screenplay (taken off John Blackburn's novel) works up a smart, if overly padded script and captivating dying half, but the knotty plot doesn't seem to click, as it moves all over the place making it hard to get comfortable and come to terms with the haunting pay-off. You might find the twist kinda obvious, but the true revelation throws you off. It does take quite awhile to hit its straps. Which could turn people off from its talkative and slow progression. However the timidly restraint and uncertain nature only makes the final 10 minutes even more unnerving, as that's when the murder mystery makes way for some creepy horror strokes. Both Sasdy and Hayles do a good enough job in keeping the viewer interested. Sasdy uses the open locations to great effect, and ably stages the set pieces with efficient slickness and ominously dark shades. Malcolm Williamson's lightly smooth jazzy score stays on the back-burner and Ken Talbot's sturdy photography keeps it stark and upfront. The performances are considerably tailor-made. Lee (more uptight than usual) and Cushing are at their assured best, even if they only have lesser parts. The spruce Diana Dors makes for a good fiery, eccentric turn and Georgia Brown's is equally impressive as the down-to-earth reporter. Gwyneth Strong wonderfully draws up her part as Mary. A middling hot (impeccably acted) and cold (unfocused story) mystery thriller.",457,0,,0,No reference

Weisz's character is the only credible character in the entire script and that's a real godsend because the rest of the script not only lacks believability in its story but lacks accountability in its execution as well because the story really does not make any sense at all.

It begins as a trivial comedy, she works in a fishing factory on the east coast, while most men are after her, especially the adventurous smuggler Gino, who proves risky. She resists him as long as possible, but the way he acts and uses force makes it impossible for her not to get caught in a trap of destiny.The story unfolds in the great Italian neo-realistic fashion, the story could have been a subject for Vittorio de Sica or Visconti, the atmosphere is the same as in ""Bicycle Thieves"" and other down to earth Italian dramas at the time, and although you are sceptical at first, the drama will more and more overwhelm you. A policeman, who truly loves her, tries to save her, but instead he unintentionally only makes matters worse, and ultimately you will understand why she has to prefer the criminal to him.But the greatest asset of the film is perhaps the location, the genuine environment among the fishermen on the east coast living in very basic conditions, their small Sunday pleasures at the dancing party, and the wonderful local people - this should actually be a classic",241,0,,0,No reference

377,2508413,2013-08-12,howard.schumann,Fruitvale Station (2013),9.0,"Based on a true incident, 27-year-old writer and director Ryan Coogler's Fruitvale Station is a disturbing account of the last day of the life of Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old African American, shot and killed by an officer of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) at the Fruitvale subway station in Oakland, California after returning celebrating New Years Eve with his friends in 2009. At the beginning of the film, actual footage is shown of the shooting but we do not yet know anything about the deceased man, his life and his dreams.Winner of both the Gran Prix and Audience Awards at Sundance and a first-film prize winner in the Un Certain Regard competition at Cannes, Fruitvale Station is a work of powerful authenticity that allows us to connect more closely with the man and the incident beyond the information we may receive on TV news. Conducting research and interviews with family and friends, the events unfold like a thriller, even though we know the inevitable outcome. Although some scenes are added for dramatic effect, there is no attempt to sugar coat Grant's life and he is presented, warts and all, as a hot-tempered ex-con, a drug dealer, an unreliable employee, and an unfaithful partner.Oscar is flawed like the rest of us but the astute and moving performance by Michael B. Jordan allows us to discover his humanity and care about him. Working to get his life back, he has received his GED despite having dropped out of high school, and has given up selling drugs. Coogler takes us through his day, which we know will be his last. Although he was fired from his job, he returns to the supermarket where he last worked to ask his boss to reconsider. He gets some food for his mother Wanda's (Octavia L. Spencer) birthday party in the evening, picks up a card for his sister who cannot come to the party, sees his daughter Tatiana (Ariana Neal), tells his girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz) that he loves her, and helps a young woman who needs advice on making a fish fry by having her talk to his grandmother (Marjorie Shears).After his mother's party, Oscar and Sophina and their friends go to San Francisco to celebrate the New Year. On their return, their celebration is cut short by cruel and unnecessary police violence caught on cell phone video which went viral and led to protest demonstrations throughout the Bay Area. Coogler's handling of the scene does not hammer us with the gruesomeness of the events but allows the audience to act simply as a witness to the crime. One of the most poignant scenes is when Oscar's mother sees his body and cries ""I told him to get on the train... I didn't think they'd hurt my baby."" Ultimately, the officer who did the shooting, Johannes Mehserle, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter by a jury in Los Angeles, and served eleven months in prison after he claimed that he intended to use his taser rather than his pistol. Although there is little doubt that the director is sympathetic to Oscar's story, Fruitvale Station does not assault us with a message, but on the eve of the profiling and shooting of an unarmed black boy in Sanford, Florida, the message is clear and does not need to be spelled out.While the incident may be different than that of Trayvon Martin, it cannot stand apart from the long history of racial injustice and the inequality of the legal system in America. While the film will not end racial tension, it may go a long way towards opening people's eyes about the reality of police misconduct. As Iranian sociologist Ali Shariati said, ""If you can't eliminate injustice, at least tell everyone about it.""",629,0,,0,No reference

381,3469363,2017-12-26,jrarichards,What We Did on Our Holiday (2014),10.0,"Today's generation gap is huge, parents find coping with with the organised chaos that is modern life an almost insuperable problem, and yet somewhere down the line kids need their parents - and hugely also their grandparents, and of course both parties can benefit if for once we just drop the stupid, profane and mostly meaningless burdens of everyday life and think about what really matters. Communing a bit with nature might do that, and from the off we know that ""What we did on our holiday"" is going to be selling the inspiringly gorgeous Scottish Highlands and Islands to us - including the midges (whose presence the film is big enough to admit to). In general, this offering both written and directed by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin dwells a lot on peoples' lying (for a vareity of reasons), yet is supremely, at times touchingly, at times even brutally, honest in its approach. Its integrity shines through. To make this work, the makers needed two sets of messed up parents to begin with (and this job is very well done by David Tennant + Rosamund Pike, as well as Ben Miller (the best thing he's done I believe) + Amelia Bullmore. Here we have two brothers markedly different from one another plus their wives. On paper, the Miller character Gavin is more successful than that played by Tennant, but he has the small difficulty of actually explaining what he even does! Basically, he's a ""short seller"" (whatever that is), and his young nephews and nieces make the kind of innocently witty remarks on that score that you might expect - to fine good comic effect! Exactly what brother Doug does is not clear either, but both of their marriages have some issues. But the stars of this show are grandparent and kids, and here there is nothing less than dream-fulfilment, as those who have long imagined how great a slightly toned-down but still pithy Billy Connolly might prove to be get their rewards. Poor old grandad is on the way out due to cancer and he is now (on the occasion of his 75th birthday party) ready, even desperate, to communicate some of his real, fundamental thoughts about the world. He feels he's not going to do very well with his sons and daughters-in-law, but wonders if he might reach them through the kids, at the same time as reaching the kids. Ultimately, he achieves more than he bargains for, when actually dying on the beach while in those kids' company; and he thus gives rise to the film's crescendo ending (on which score I'll avoid all spoilers).Many of the lines Connolly gets to utter are just superb, and the way he puts them across likewise. It's a treat.However, as Connolly interacts magnificently with Emilia Jones as Lottie, Bobby Smalldridge as Mickey and Harriet Turnbull as the youngest Jess, even he is at the same time being upstaged by them. These kids are just splendidly talented, appealing, and extremely, extremely funny. What is more, they often convey huge meaning in what they say and do, as kids invariably will. There is total, disarming authenticity here.Lottie - being the oldest - is most affected by her parents' marital problems, and has become rather withdrawn and anxious. Seeing her transform with the events of the film is a moving and at times powerful joy to watch. More depth and reality is conveyed by Emilia Jones's performance than in many, many previous films we've seen.Indeed, comedy laugh-out-loud this may be, but we take a great deal of value and meaning from this piece if we focus in on it (and also if we perservere through a perhaps slightly unpromising-looking first few minutes).Let's face it, a family get-together in a big house in the remote and beautiful wilds of Scotland is a concept that has a lot going for it from the outset, but the gem of giving equal weight to three generations of the family (with actors truly capable of pushing that idea through), of allowing the lines to flow with such a mix of wit and wisdom, of achieving the perfect mix of physical and verbal comedy, and of pursuing a plot-line of typically British eccentricity, is a really great achievement that should not be underestimated.At moments, ""What we did on our holiday"" risks straying towards the syrupy or naive, but it mostly, mainly stays on the right side of the line. That'as deft work by the makers. The film also very wisely plays only slightly with the English-Scottish stuff, remaining good-humoured and avoiding easy laughs based around divisiveness in favour of meaningful content that Brits from Land's End to John O'Groats can readily identify with. And they certainly should do so, as the rewards are very considerable. I expected little here and got a very great deal (appropriately enough on Christmas Day).

Inasmuch as it sublimates their desire to punch each other I suppose boxing serves a useful social purpose. You certainly can't blame a working-class stiff from New Jersey like Jim Braddock from using his fast right fist and high tolerance for punishment as a way out of grinding poverty for his family, and he was an inspiring figure for many in the 1930s. This is not a person trying to find themselves through fisticuffs like Hilary Swank's tragic character in ""Million Dollar Baby"".""Cinderella Man"" (a title bestowed on Braddock by legendary journalist Damon Runyon) is a superior Hollywood biopic from journeyman director Ron Howard who previously directed Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"", a biopic about a more cerebral man, the brilliant and troubled Nobel prize-winning mathematician John Nash. Hence there is plenty of schmaltz and contrived emotion, almost to Spielbergian proportions, but there are also good production values and thus we get a fine recreation of the look and feel of the depression years in the urban US. There is also some fine acting.Russell plays Braddock as a fairly quiet, very stoic and steely determined man who sticks to his values throughout. An old-fashioned hero, in fact, with moments of desperation but not much self-doubt (and not much time for it either). He is an exemplary husband and father. It's a pretty low-key performance but well-judged. When he's not throwing telephones at hapless hotel desk clerks Russell can do a good job. Paul Giamatti as Joe the agent gives us a well-rounded character rather than a caricature and Renee Zellweger ably supports Russ as Mae Braddock.As this is a biopic, it can be revealed that Braddock eventually prevails and was world champion until defeated by Joe Louis two years later. In his championship fight against Max Baer (turned into a bad guy for the purposes of the movie via a wonderful bit of hamming by Craig Bierko), Braddock won by lasting the distance (all 15 rounds) just a bit better than Baer. There is a lot of actual boxing in what is quite a long film and we get to see about half the title fight. For me, the boxing scenes could have been shorter but as we know, people pay to see this sort of thing and Howard is not about to disappoint the crowd. The suspense is terrific, even if you know the result.But the last word has to be with Paul Simon:In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down or cut him 'til he cried out in his anger and his shame I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains",495,0,,0,No reference

A ""what if"" that could make a good story; perhaps an episode-long piece on ""60 Minutes"" or ""20/20"".Bryan Fogel, who directed it, is like a man wanting to learn what is like to be a tiger and, in wanting to get closer to the truth, inadvertently locks himself in the tiger's cage.Icarus is like two stories. The silly, and somewhat egotistical quest of Bryan Fogel to prove that doping is rampant and easy to get away with (duh!) while helping himself win the amateur race that has eluded him for years. It is difficult to find a way to sympathize for any person during this part of the story. Then Bryan meets a very amusing and very cynical Russian scientist named Grigory Rodchenkov, who is going to help him. They talk via Skype frequently, and even their dogs participate. We then go into the obligatory montage of training, preparation, and failures that seems all too familiar. That is, until something changes.There is a marked and brilliant turning point in the movie when Grigory, a smiling and joking class clown up until that point, faces directly at the camera in a Skype conversation with Bryan and asks ""have you seen a movie about me?"" From that point on, the story's point of view changes from Bryan to Grigory and we learn something that we cannot unlearn, and realize that there is no going back. We learn that Grigory is the real protagonist and we are heading in a very dark and dangerous direction for Grigory, for Bryan, and for those around them.One cannot blame those viewers who, prior to that point, were bored and wondered if this would be yet another expose on how privileged guys like Bryan were cheating the system for a moment of temporary glory and how doping had permeated into the weekend warriors scene. One cannot blame those viewers for walking away (I almost did), if they thought that's where we were going. I am sure that's where Bryan thought he was going too. That is, until the cage locked behind us...What I call the second story in Icarus is based on terror; a terror of the light, not the dark, to borrow a line from Grigory. Real people get killed (allegedly) - this is a documentary, so death is very real. The ride is frantic, claustrophobic, and bitter-sweet. There is an ending but, then again, there isn't one. At the end of the story, we care deeply for Grigory, Bryan, and even Max the dog, and continue to wonder ""what if"".Icarus is one of the most brilliant documentaries that I have ever seen.",450,0,mentions other viewers in another context,0,No reference

Sadly, it was.Like many of the other reviewers here, neither of us could believe that a senior police officer could possibly be so incredibly naive that she could believe she could get away with entering into a relationship with a recently released killer. A 20 year old DC? Maybe. A Commander level with years of experience? Not in a million years. And yet that is what La Plante would have us believe.Worse, we are supposed to believe that the Commander is happy to continue with the relationship and become more deeply involved even after credible suspicions become apparent that he might be responsible for two recent murders? Really?Question? If our killer was really so worried about being caught out that he needed to construct such a pair of amazingly complex alibis in advance of the killings (as was revealed towards the end), wouldn't it have been a whole lot easier if he'd simply changed his method of killing so he wasn't the obvious suspect as the method was the ONLY thing that connected him to the murders? With someone of our boy's obvious intelligence, you would have thought that might have occurred to him. It obviously never occurred to La Plante though.I kept hoping for a twist in the plot that would lead us to a credible ending. No such luck. When both of us concluded that there was no possible way Blake could survive being caught in the relationship at the end without being chucked off the force for gross incompetence, that ends up not being the case at all. Instead, the reviewing team comes up with the equivalent of ""Who's been a naughty girl then? Shame on you. Don't do it again or there will be trouble next time. Tsk tsk tsk.""

Its not about saving the city or saving the world or bunch of people from huge monsters or killer robots. Its just about saving yourself and the few kids around you by finding who you really are and what your powers are.The New Mutants is first and foremost a drama. Secondly, it has some horror elements, but only so, that it wont make you loose sleep. Thirdly, there is some action and nice special effects.The cast was mostly great: the whole movie has less actors in it than Castaway, but they are well - casted. Blu Hunt is perfect Dani Moonstar, Anya Taylor-Joy is perfect Illyana and Maisie Williams fits perfectly as Rahne Sinclair. The guys, however, are little too old and manly to play teenagers.I've read New Mutants in the nineties (like the Asgard Saga), and although Josh Boone's vision has little resemblance with the epic adventures this little group has in the comics, there were a lot of nice details here and there. Most of them were related to Illyana/Magik, her lovely pet dragon and beautiful shiny sword :)The movie might have benefited from couple of extra scenes to flesh out some aspects, but this way it was ok enough.I'm saddened by the fact that after postponing this so much, they finally publish it at the same time as Christopher Nolan movie.

After the opening sequences of this movie, the directing devolves to a hack job.I just watched the movie ""Overnight,"" which is a documentary about Troy Duffy, the director. I can totally understand why this movie didn't sell in Cannes, even with Cassian Elwes as the agent in charge of selling it. No distributor would buy this movie for a theatrical release (of course), but home video, yeah, there was a market for this there. It's got lots of violence and gunplay, so if that's all you care about, you'll probably like this movie. The fact that half of the violence in this movie is not motivated (and gratuitous)... hey, who cares as long as there's blood and guts, right?? ***Spoiler Alert: And the cat killing scene is a total rip-off from Pulp Fiction. I mean, c'mon, dude. How lame.I can also understand why this guy hasn't been able to get his 2nd movie off the ground to date.

403,631405,2003-07-18,FlorisV,Solaris (2002),,"This movie has an annoying, sluggish, artsy pace reminiscent of Kubrick's space turd called 2001: A Space Oddissey. Fortunately, it's slightly better. Instead of just raising questions what the hell the plot is all about, the movie is more about universal questions. The plot is more clear but there's still enough to make you guess. Is Solaris some sort of heaven were souls come back from? Is it a giant alien able to create hallucinations and read minds? What is death and what happens afterwards? Is there a god?The movie looks good and has overall fine acting. What I didn't like however was the offbeat, overly weird acting by the two male supporting actors. They were trying too hard to be different and were whispering the entire movie. It had this overly artsy feel to it like they desperately wanted to have as much weirdness in the film as possible. I would say it is better to have more identifiable characters in a film, otherwise you estrange your audience. I guess Soderbergh is to blaim, a director willing to try anything can be faulty. However, I did like the female doctor and Clooney and the other actress were fine (sorry, names....). I'm not sure about the clinical style the movie has because it makes you care less about the characters and identify less with them, while their emotions have an enormous influence on their actions and inactions in this story.So, there's plenty of flaws to this film. Still, I liked part of it. I love SciFi in general and this is true SciFi, I also liked the visuals, and the ideas behind the story. The movie is worth discussing afterwards, especially the end will have you wondering...what happened? I thought Clooney was not Clooney anymore but a ""clone"" created by Solaris. That would explain him feeling unfamiliar with earth when he came back. As for a more universal theme the film raises questions like is there an afterlife and what does it look like? Like one of the characters says there's no answers, only choices.In the making of, James Cameron stated you won't see a movie like this in the 70s, 80s, 90s or in the near future. He looked kind of angry too, probably feeling people underrated this film. Tho I would agree Solaris has a unique quality I still think it was a bit of an arrogant statement of Cameron, as much as I admire his work. I think, if you look well enough, you'll find plenty of thoughtprovoking, intelligent, offbeat and non-action scifi out there, like Silent Running, Logan's Run (70s), Brazil (80s) and Dark City (90s). And the original Solaris was a 70s film as well, I haven't seen it so I can't tell if it's that different.Overall, still an interesting one to watch. 7 out of 10.",472,0,,0,No reference

There's also the ones that can do both at the same time (Nightmare on Elm Street). This is one of the funny ones and before you start critiquing it, you have to realize that. With that statement in mind, this movie is great. Vilmer's remote controlled leg is probably the funniest of all. Many laughs are produced off of that one. And then there's strange old Leatherface. When the victims and that cuckoo torturous family get together, you are talking pure enjoyment that has got to be fun for whole family 15 and above.

I liked Robin Williams in the role and I thought he had some very hilarious lines, I don't think the script is week at all because I found myself laughing and even crying sometimes at some of the hilarious lines of dialogue. Cheryl Hines is funny as well here, and also I'd like to give a big shout out to Kristen Chenoweth, I think she brought some really good energy and funniness to the movie. Kristen's character had a lot of physical humor with her jiggling breasts, and also just her persona and the way she says things. JoJo is very impressive and funny here as the very sarcastic and kinda smart ass daughter. I also really liked Josh Hutcherson here, he showed that he had the both dramatic and comedic acting jobs. Now why am I giving this movie a six? I think it's because it's true that some of the movie does drag and through the middle of the film it gets a little bit boring at times. Will Arnett got on my nerves too, he wasn't funny or even mildly amusing in his character, I think that was a bad casting decision to cast Will. I also really liked Hunter Parrish, he was cute, funny and very charming, especially with the teenage daughter Cassie. Now as far as family entertainment goes, no, this is not the best movie to pick, but it certainly isn't a flop.

I LOVED his early stuff, but it seems like as years go by and maybe I'll try either to read a newer book by him or in this case try to watch a movie / series that he has written. And, it always is the same. The characters (which USED to be his strong point long, LONG ago) are bloody ALWAYS the same. Transparent, shallow, self-serving @ssholes, especially ANY authority figures.In addition to that and bearing more on this show here, I just found the voice-over INCREDIBLY stupid and distracting to what COULD have been maybe a decent story. ***VERY MINOR SPOILERS*** Right at the beginning when there is a cool shot of the black bird sitting on the guy, good ol' Stephen couldn't just let us squirm with the suspense of seeing the guy lying there, not able to move, and this carrion bird sitting on his chest. For God's frigg'n sake! Just LEAVE it! That would have been just perfectly fine because then the audience would be increasingly worried and on the edge of their seats to see what happens. But NOOOOOOOOOO... Not good enough for ol' Smart@ss Steve. Nope, he's gotta have this totally INANE voice-over like the bird is talking or something, and he says, 'mmmm, looks tasty. I think I'll start with the eyes' Are you frigg'n KIDDING me!??? Talk about horrendously stupid. And from there it is just more of the same. for another example, instead of just showing us maybe vague, ghostly half-seen images of the little girl, they bloody well put her full on the screen for a few seconds, looking right at you. And then this incredibly IDIOTIC voice-over comes in and says something unbelievably moronic like 'That is the one you will have to keep your eye on', or some such bloody nonsense.***END SPOILERSI guess what the bottom line is here is that, as the audience, you feel SO damn insulted that all these 'cute' lines and crap are put in there and it's like you are increasingly getting more and more frustrated, and finally yell out, ""Just get on with the DAMN story and LEAVE OUT all the crappy cute dialog for God's sake!!!""Just bloody AWFUL!And, it is not that I just don't like remakes, because the 2004 version of Stephen King's 'SALEM'S LOT' is actually pretty good.Maybe it's just me and my personal taste. If YOU happen to like your Horror with all these inane and cute voice-overs and constant 'wink winks' at the audience, then by all means go for it. Others here have apparently liked it and most likely appreciate Stephen King much more than I do. So, I don't know... For ME, it was God-Awful.

Phil Jacks was a good man, who ingratiated Chester and Matt as he was asking them to ride back to the herd Dolph Quince, he, and other Texans were driving up to Dodge. There seems to be a little misunderstanding about the distance involved. As I understand it, it was five day's ride FROM the herd to Dodge. well, they still had to ride back to the herd, didn't they? so let's see if we can give a little understanding to the timing, here.First, Jacks had to ride north, and let's say it was a total of five day's ride to get there. He had to have not just his normal mount, but a pack mount that could also double as a second riding mount. You MUST rest your horses. If you get forty miles a day, that's some real distance. That's because, you have to take breaks, water (Yeah, WATER - the stuff you AND your horse; your best friend, need), and rest your horses, and yourself, and you have to take supplies with you; food, water - again, at least to or three canteens full; probably at least a half tent, coffee, cooking gear, fire equipment, and other things that are necessary. Jacks gets to Dodge, he's gonna wanna re-stock his food and coffee supplies, get some shuteye, a good meal, and a good breakfast the next day, He'll probably wanna trade horses for fresh ones, and let's not forget that Matt and Chester need the same things.They start out the next morning, rested and ready. If I was Matt, I'd make Jacks sleep in the jail, and not get out partying. NOW, they have probably about how many days left? Well, if memory serves, Jacks rode about 200 miles to get to Dodge, didn't he? If he rode 40 miles a day for five days; well, yup, that figgers, don't it? NOPE. How about if he rode five days out? 200 miles? , yeahhhhhh..NOPE.Let's just say he rode about thirty a day, saved his horses, and rode five days up to Dodge from the South Kansas border. THAT'S much more believable. Of course, we must also consider the fact that they are driving cattle. If you get six miles a day out of your herd, that's good distance. All the other stuff applies, though. So, five days up to Dodge, figure a day of rest and re-supply, and back down would be about four days, or nine days total riding.Nobody remembers about the trail, or pack horse, but if you're riding a distance, you absolutely want to split up the weight between your mounts. They are life and death (literally) on the prairie. I know, it's only guesswork, because there are always unexpected things that slow you down. The Jayhawkers got their just desserts, and it was sad to see a good Man like Jacks get killed. If I'm thinking' right, The cowboys dug down about a foot, stripped those 'Hawkers, and opened their bellies, so the buzzards and coyotes would clean them up, and then threw some dirt on top of them; just so's they could say they buried them. Matt did the killin'; he gets the guns and saddles.I was surprised and happy to see Ken Curtis in this one, and prodding and kidding Dennis Weaver; them turning into friends. Jack Elam in younger days when he was properly fence rail tough was a real revelation, wasn't it?? Very good episode.",589,0,,0,No reference
410,1225760,2006-06-22,slokes,Diggstown (1992),7.0,"James Woods went through a period, he later told Cigar Aficionado magazine, where all he did in movies was play ""hard guys in suits."" ""Diggstown"" is a classic example, yet a welcome relief, too, in the sense for once Woods wasn't taking himself at all seriously.Woods is Gabriel Caine, a former dealer in phony art who is sprung from prison and hatches a scheme to take in John Gillon, the vicious boss of Diggstown, played by Bruce Dern. After Caine's buddy, Fitz (Oliver Platt), hustles Gillon's son out of his classic Corvette, Fitz and Caine give Gillon a chance to win it back by wagering a fighter named Honey Roy Palmer (Louis Gossett Jr.) can outbox any ten Diggstown men in a day.While a buddy movie of a kind, most of the focus is on Woods' performance, delivered with his usual array of tics, smirky grins, long hooded stares, etc. It's easy to be cool when you know what the next line is in the script, but screenwriter Steven McKay's wit and way of winking at the audience keeps things from getting too stale.Confronted by a warden about a prisoner escape Caine engineered: ""The important thing is not to take this as a rejection of you personally.""Or how about when a hood puts a noose around Caine's neck and hoists him from a tree limb, saying it will be a pleasure to kill him. Would you be ruffled? Me, too. Not Caine: ""I'll bet four dollars against an hour with your mother that it won't happen."" After he's punched in the gut, Caine apologizes. ""I'm really sorry. That was insulting. Five bucks.""Ultimately, ""Diggstown"" is a con movie where the audience is being conned. Like ""The Sting,"" we are given some information but a few surprises along the way, which are turned with varying degrees of skill. Unlike ""The Sting,"" ""Diggstown"" suffers from many implausible moments, a painfully weak finale, and out-of-thin-air subplots that go nowhere, especially one involving Heather Graham, who kills you with those eyes so much you almost overlook how bad her performance is. Platt, a terrific actor who never seems to find a worthy project, has a great introduction and then largely fades from view.But what you get is more good than bad, and at times brilliant, especially when Honey Roy has his day in the ring with the Diggstown Ten. It's a memorably directed sequence by Michael Ritchie, alternately harrowing and hilarious, with Gossett a pillar of strength whether his opponent is a guy named Hammerhead or some palooka he needs to carry long enough for Fitz to milk the crowd with side bets.""You're the one that kept drilling me that half the money's in the acting,"" Honey Roy tells Caine.Actually, all the money's in the acting in ""Diggstown,"" but Woods, Gossett, Platt, and Dern are more than enough to compensate for the inanities that sometimes crop up around them.

412,2180100,2011-09-18,chaos-rampant,"Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler (1922)",,"I really urge you to watch this, but watch beyond the caper, watch the character beyond the simply nefarious evil mastermind that he appears as, and you'll be stunned with the the complexity of forces at work; at the center is a man who - having mastered the mind - can guide vision into shaping worlds and, from the inverse point-of-view of the unwitting victims, the shaped world as the stage of some indecipherable, chaotic spiel.So what this really is, is the precursor of film noir. The genre as later assumed by American hands - once Germans fled there - transferred Mabuse out of sight, but the fundamental movement remains: we had to assume the notion that somewhere, on a cosmic station above, the images that down here formed reality were being controlled and manipulated. What the protagonists in these films experienced as a world of fertile, opportunous chaos, and would therefore exploit to their own advantage, was eventually revealed to be a chimera of the mind led astray; the world was being supervised and kept in ledgers all along.This is pretty amazing stuff to have then; we can see the manipulator inside the manipulated world, and the motions that bring consequences on both ends of the illusion. The first scene shows Mabuse dealing cards with on them the faces of the players, the actors who are about to perform in the orchestrated fiction - Mabuse's inside the film, and also Lang's film about Mabuse. And there is a woman who is our surrogate viewer in all this; she watches the gamblers from a distance, searching faces for thrills and sensations. All this touches at the heart of self-referential cinema in ways that still astound by how erudite, how in-sightful. Viewers who are looking for films about the mind weaving films will be delighted. There is one scene that will be absolutely unequaled in film until the second great cinema of Resnais and Tarkovsky some forty years later. It shows Mabuse operating an illusion on stage before a packed theater; the entire audience watches transfixed at people magically walking out of a screen into the middle of the auditorium - and vanishing at a snap of the fingers - none of them realizing the confrontation that is actually playing out within the fantasy.But there is an extra layer that further elevates this. So what is perceived by the players as unluck or the chance turn of a card, from our double perspective rooted in Mabuse's mind is revealed as part of the same, decisive plan. Yet Mabuse is not a godlike presence, he is steeped in human passions; icy but on occasion petulant, seething, lusting, the mask full of emotional cracks.So, on one level we have a controlled reality as a puppet show of absurdities, but on the other end finally we get a glimpse of the mind cracking under the weight of what it must control, under the burden of the operated illusion. The final vision is a nightmare where these controlled images animate themselves against their tyrant. Tellingly it happens in a locked room; the blind people that were tasked by Mabuse to deal with his fortunes, in fact his counterfeit fortunes, now transform into apparitions of guilt.Few films have so deeply influenced our cinematic vision, from Vertigo to Lynch. It has been since disguised and embellished, but it's revealed here for the first time.",567,0,,0,No reference

From Christopher Lee to the chilling witch hunt and stake burning of the opening to the climatic battle with the coven in the graveyard. Outstanding!

The UN promised that this would be a safe zone, but doesn't back up its ultimatums with action, leaving the small contingent of UN peacekeepers helpless in the face of stronger Serbian forces, who step-by-step get bolder, take over the town, and eventually the civilians seeking safety at the UN base.I saw this as a digital screening of the Toronto International Film Festival, with writer / director Q+A. The writer put together the story based on actual transcripts, together with survivor stories. Many were composited into the main character Aida. Aida is a translator for the UN troops, and she also tries to keep safe her husband and 2 teenaged sons,. Thus she could move between the ""defenders"" and the defended, and tell the stories of both.The characters are well-played and believable, and there are little touches that are illuminating: some flashbacks to pre-war life, a reference to neighbors turning against neighbors, etc. My one complaint is that, as a composite, some events seem to happen too quickly.",178,0,,0,No reference
418,1883411,2009-11-15,funkyfry,Bound for Glory (1976),8.0,"Unravelling at a leisurely pace and featuring some of the best folk music of the 20th Century, this film takes a look at the early life of Woody Guthrie, from his days scraping a living painting signs in Texas to his small-time success on L.A. radio and his labor activism. Thanks largely to the deft but light hand of director Hal Ashby and a well modulated performance from David Carradine, the film manages to get its ideas across without seeming sentimental or cloying.Guthrie has a complicated relationship with his wife (Melinda Dillon) and forms close friendships with strange men (and women) everywhere he goes. One of his closest friends is Ozark Bule (Ronny Cox), a semi-successful folkie who brings Guthrie along to the radio station and inspires him to help with the union, but who balks at Guthrie's extreme sense of anti-commercialism. The film overall does a pretty good job of showing how Guthrie had some real weaknesses, and that his anti-authoritarian stance wasn't just a case of righteousness but more one of personal conviction.Haskell Wexler's photography should be applauded, because the film's slow pace allows us to drink in the beauty of so many landscapes and dustbowl worker's camps. The musical selections are excellent. I only wish the film could have gone on longer, and showed us some of his real success that led to him becoming world-famous. It's too bad there wasn't a chance to do another film about his time in NYC and his eventual illness.",249,0,,0,No reference

When I first saw the trailers for this and I checked it on my watchlist, I thought I was checking an action-packed movie with somewhat competent performances, a plot revolving on honor and all that knight's/warrior's code. Well, the first is kind of true not truly. The second is not and the third, well, the third is the whole plot of the movie. Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman, fine damn actors. Owen is slightly above average on this one, playing at first a a badass warrior, then changing into a decadent man and ending with the badass again. Freeman, well, what can I say about Freeman? It's not that I didn't like his performance, but I also didn't love it. Its just for the paycheck,nothing more. Clive was certainly the best of the movie altogether with the other knight's of the Seventh Rank. In spite of casting a good lead, a credible master, and somewhat competent warriors, the production just went off the track with the rest of the cast, with the exception of Ayelet Zurer as Naomi which I quite liked. Let's get to it, shall we?I want to see ""Headhunters"", I do, but after seeing what Aksel Hennie delivered in this one, I'm frightened. He plays the main villain and if you play the villain you can make some abuses. But well, this guy is,in my opinion, worse than Nicolas Cage on his outbursts. The only thing he does throughout the whole film is over-bloody-acting! I didn't feel anything for his character, I just wanted it to stay off-screen. It was, bad, really shameful, cringeworthy. The rest of the cast it's just a poor mix of not that great actors.The film only shines on the action sequences. It starts well, with some skirmish but then you have to wait about an hour and ten minutes for the next draw of swords. It just drags. Gratefully, these scenes are well shot and edited and realist and I think that most of the actors did their stunt work, specially Owen. ""Last Knights"" is only enjoyable on the fight scenes.

Since it's barely futuristic at all, I'd say it's more appropriate to refer to it as an alternate reality than merely something set years from now. In it, time is the only currency(and this point is hammered home... one thing is that the word replaces the word ""money"", but there are painful puns on that, where the meaning of common phrases are turned into something else, such as how here, ""do you have a minute"" is the equivalent to ""spare some change"". The points made are great, the communication could sometimes use some work. Niccol's biggest flaw is that he tends to overwrite scripts when he has something to say, and the conveying gradually loses subtlety... with that said, there are bits where it is spot-on, and the ending of this is fantastic), you do not age beyond 25(leading to a world where most people are supermodels... to be fair, the film itself does poke fun at this aspect) at which moment your life will only have one additional year, and you can now earn more by labor(and don't expect to be able to pay debts, taxes and the like and have much at all left for yourself or your family). The metaphor is entirely clear, and not only does this this fit nearly perfectly with the current Occupy movement, some of the better of the plenty of good, quotable dialog in this lends itself to slogans for it. Our hero does go on to fight the wealthy elite, who do not enjoy their lives because they're worried about losing what they have, so they take no chances. Some of the logic and consistency is a tad iffy. He is joined by rich girl wanting to break free from her sheltered existence, Sylvia(Seyfried), and they do the Robin Hood thing. While the inclusion of a romance between the two is predictable, the execution isn't bad. The characters are memorable and their arcs tend to be convincing. This has some of the shallow Hollywood standards going, with the poor being largely honorable and doing little wrong(if it does admit that a lot of crime happens in the ghetto... however, this feels like it's blaming those in power for creating that situation, which is true a lot of the way... still, no one is that black and white), and, well, you can guess how the other side is portrayed. I like that our main cop, Leon(Murphy), is clearly a person of integrity, he's not drunk on power. The acting is impressive. This is the first thing I see Justin in, and I would like to see other movies starring him. Though the action is somewhat derivative and uninspired not to mention in very brief stints(Andrew is not comfortable with the genre, and I support him sticking with what he does well, see what immediately follows this parenthesis), this gets quite intense. There is a little moderate language(one strong, as per what the PG-13 rating allows... and it's placed so well), mild violence and somewhat disturbing sights(when your clock runs out, you collapse from a heart attack) in this. I recommend this to anyone who cares about the current political and financial situation, as well as fans of thought-provoking thrillers. 7/10",546,0,,0,No reference

When I heard that Danny Boyle directed ""The Beach"", I wanted to see it, because I absolutely love his films. And, after all, the Beach was a well shot movie with good scenes and so, but... well... many points and the whole meaning of the book were taken away. For example: The second lead role (a hippy with a long beard) was taken out completely. Maybe, because the scenes he was featured in were too violent or disgusting (especially the ending that was completely changed) for a Hollywood film, and Sal, who was described a bit like Drew Barrymore (friendly, big, attractive and calm), the real opposite of her film-character, became the really worst villain in film history.

There are many bad points in ""the Beach"", but I can't tell them all. But what annoyed me the most was the ending: The original one had to do with hate, paranoia, trust and even racism and gives you this ""alone"" feeling. The ending in the movie was too... happy. ""Everything's okay, all in the right place again..."" and so on. Also, the brilliant dream sequences who came after every chapter were taken out... also because of violence...

""The Beach"" tries to be a good story, a PG-13 version of the book, but is still too far away from a teen movie, making it look like a childish mixture-version of ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Apocalypse Now!"". Read the novel, it is BRILLIANT!!!!

429,1929305,2010-02-18,minky-mark,Law Abiding Citizen (2009),9.0,"OK. Well, i thought this movie was great. It had a huge amount of suspense, keeping you at the edge of your seat practically the whole movie. It was a great change for a movie with a mass murder. Instead of the boring classic of a person killing with guns or fists, they spruce it up to a more interesting matter. The acting was fantastic although the F word could have been a little bit used less. It also had some humor as well. My favorite scene was in the court room, where the judge was getting completely owned. I would highly recommend this movie. now lets go to the ending which quite a few people seemed to dislike. I enjoyed the ending quite well. I don't know what people's opinion of a ""classic Hollywood ending"" is. But i don't think this was one of them. It ended fairly abrupt, but if it got too much longer, people would be complaining about the length instead of the ending. What i find quite amusing is people are whining about the ending, but they don't supply viewers with their opinion of what to change about it. What do you want to happen? - have the criminal blow up the people and the movie go on for another hour with people trying to prove him guilty? and if so, how do you expect the authorities to grip proof it was him? would you allow more people to die instead of having the mass murderer get a taste of his own medicine? I think the ending was very well played out and if people are going to criticize it they should supply viewers with what they would change. Everyone is allowed to have their own opinion, but should back it up with more than saying, ""it ended quickly.""OK. this movie was incredible and i highly recommend it to anyone that doesn't get offended with violence or vulgar language.

Is it a groundbreaking horror that trucks convention? That'll be a big 'no'. But is it fun? Well, I thought so. It's cheesy, sleazy, and occasionally gory, with that unmistakable '80s vibe that makes even a bad movie entertaining.Pretty teen Robin Adams (Sullivan Hester, in her one and only movie) leaves her father's Xmas get-together to drive to a more lively party with her pal Monica (Laura Kallison). On the way, the girls are stopped and taken hostage by three criminals on the run from a local penitentiary: Louis 'Face' Napoleon (Alex Kubik), Mongo (Michael Nash) and Randy 'Hotrod' Carter (Mark Witsken), who was forced to take part in the escape by his ruthless cellmates.In order to avoid a roadblock, Randy steers the car down a country lane that leads to an old deserted mine. Driving over a disused shaft, the car plummets into the ground, where the survivors come face-to-face with a deranged cannibal. Investigating the area, Sheriff Billy Williams (Randy Powell) follows the criminals and their hostages into the mine but isn't prepared for the horrors that await.This one was apparently shelved for five years before finally seeing the light of day (in 1993), but it isn't any worse than many similar films from that era, and definitely better than quite a few. The plot is routine and the dialogue predictable, but the cast put in decent performances given what they have to work with. Alex Kubik is particularly great as slimy child-killer Face, the actor hamming it up a treat at every opportunity. Kudos also to Elizabeth Kent as Rachel, the strange woman who lives in the old pay office above the mine: her show-stopping speech at the end of the film is an audacious exercise in over-acting that is a marvel to behold. At the other end of the scale, Cameron 'never one to turn down a gig' Mitchell sleepwalks through his role as Robin's father, the movie sporadically cutting to the concerned old man to justify the actor's star billing.Mitchell's scenes aside, director Leszek Burzynski keeps the brace brisk, and whenever things threaten to drag, he throws in something trashy to keep the viewer entertained, whether it be a some gratuitous nudity (during a hilarious impromptu sex scene, and when Face forces Monica to strip for him), some gore (the discovery of the half-eaten remains of Mongo being the most grisly moment, made all the more revolting when Randy has to fish his torch out of the dead man's innards), or having his lead actress strip to her underwear to take an underwater swim (granny pants alert!).6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for crazy Rachel's mine-related sexy talk: ""You go down.... down... until you find a shaft.""",471,0,,0,No reference

Rachel Weisz, Tom Wilkinson, and Timothy Spall all bring excellent performances to the screen in order for us to fathom the disconcerting premises on which the book and drama are based: rewriting history to erase the past, not to reveal our shameful heritage. The narrative involves the viewers' heart and mind in an uneasy setting where foreign laws and non-American rules hold sway over decisions that would otherwise seem to audiences as self-evident.

(Kopa fans...Be warned for this one)😑your joking...Really?look,I like the idea of Simba and Nala having a son but that would be to much like the original,Plus,Kopa wasn't a Disney creation!Some people might know this already,He was created by a outside company wanting to pitch in on the fame and fortune on the lion king franchise!And while in a interview with the creators behind the lion king 2 they said very bluntly,They didn't even know kopa existed!And maybe if they knew he was around,they would've contacted his creators and had him in the movie!But that didn't happen...So for those complaining where this cub is,Despite how many facts,Theories,And explanations you come up with,he never existed,The creators of this film didn't know he existed,Get over it!(sorry kopa lovers)Overall,this movie is great!i think out of all the Romeo and Juliet cartoon movies I've seen,I think this is the best out of all of them!Despite the minor flaws,It has memorable characters,A ambitious villain,Catchy songs,and lives up to the original movie!I highly recommend giving it a try!Im positive you'll love it!Maybe even more than the first film!😉",418,1,why do numerous people hate it,1,Reference to other reviews

When special effects were used, particularly during the 'dark' periods they were generally excellent and the introduction of pyramid head to the proceedings intensified the horror aspect of the film.

It is just a marvellous, beautiful, wonderful affirmation of life and love- one of the most romantic films ever made. Powell and Pressburger and Marius Goring's creation of the Heavenly Conductor is pure genius, and Goring excels in what is easily his best screen role. His role could have so easily descended into embarrassingly camp (and he is camp at times, but so wonderful to watch), but, with such brilliant writing and and an exquisite performance, he comes out of the film smelling just like that gorgeous rose that he collects Kim Hunter's ""evidence"", a single tear drop, with. My pick for the most beautiful moment/shot I have seen in a film.The photography is brilliant, and Heaven is filmed in black-and-white in what may have been an initially unexpected twist (After all, Dorothy's utopia Oz is in colour and the dull-looking Kansas takes on sepia tones), but it works wonderfully and is perfect in expressing the film's theme: that the earth, despite it's wars, indifference etc is so beautiful because of our capacity to love...even stronger than any ""laws"" in Heaven...so it is richly coloured, while Heaven, orderly and looking very lovely in b+w is ""Starved of Technicolour (or life's colour) up there...""

Johnny Depp again transfigures himself into another quirky yet endearing character: a dyslexic young man who channels his shyness through his jaw-dropping imitations of Buster Keaton, and finds his soul mate in Joon, a girl who suffers from a mental illness, maybe schizophrenia. She cannot get along with anyone besides her protective brother Benny, as she is prone to panic attacks at the slightest provocation, which includes the former housekeeper having smelly hair. But throughout the film, we see, as Depp's Sam sees, that despite her mental illness she is a strong-willed, bright, and beautiful individual who may be more independent than her brother presumes. Not that Benny is an overbearing hover-copter; we see how concerned he is for her happiness and well-being, sacrificing his freedom and romantic pursuits to give her the best care possible. You can't help admiring him (his good looks and steadfast love for his sister) and wishing he were your older brother. All three characters are marvelously portrayed, and the plot, though somewhat predictable and cheesy, ends in such a hilarious and sweet note that it makes the whole movie experience delightful.

She declines, but they continue to meet for occasional resumptions of their physical relationship over a seventeen year period despite the fact he now has a wife and daughter.The film rapidly becomes a Japanese equivalent of 'Back Street', in which Okada belies her early charmingly robust initial persona by becoming more and more morbidly obsessed with Nagato, who foolishly persists with their affair, despite it plainly taking an increasingly unhealthy turn. The film builds to a melodramatic conclusion that takes place in 1962, the same year Wong Kar-wai's 'In the Mood for Love' commences.

462,4791997,2020-03-18,Mnemosyne15,Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),8.0,"One of the reasons why film thinking is different from other artistic thinking is that film does not need to be described, and it does not need to be processed by other media and communication methods. The camera can directly and completely record this complete space and movement in space, but literature must describe It is the same with all kinds of details, sculpture, and fine arts. Only the movie is closer to the original reality, and the movie is closer to life. He can really show the details of life directly. This is why Bazan said that film art does not imitate reality, but reality imitates film. What he meant was that film directly created reality, which also led to different ways of thinking between film and literature, film processing and literary processing It's quite different. Film only intercepts and does not need to describe encoding and conversion. What about literature? If you are interested, you can think about how to use the lens to express the scene of the rice dumplings I described earlier, how to express it in words, and see if the way of thinking is different.
Furthermore, in terms of authenticity, films are also fictional, but they are also fictional. Films have a closer life-like realism, repainting and painting, sculptures are made more lifelike, and literary depiction is not as immersive as realism. The movie is closer to reality, although everyone is fake. Of course, this is only more realistic, and authenticity is not the sole purpose of art.",254,0,,0,No reference

Once again Charlie Kaufman takes the kernel of a great idea and overloads it with his own obsessive personality. The idea of a couple fighting to retain beautiful memories of their past together while undergoing a memory erasure is ingenious. Kaufman definitely hits some poignant notes along the way (he's great at communicating the mundane pleasures and comforts of relationships), but Joel and Clementine's characters seem like mere sketches rather than fully developed people that the audience can care about. Joel in particular is maddening because he's the same schlubby protagonist that is in all of Kaufman's scripts: it's Charlie himself. The man is simply incapable of creating characters outside the bounds of his own personality. Also, the movie isn't as enjoyable as it should be. Though I wanted to see how it ended (even though I predicted the plot twist about 30 minutes into the movie), Kaufman denies the audience the pleasures of human connection with the characters in favor of convoluted, intricately distanced storytelling. The characters come across as rats in an experiment or pawns in a chess game or any other omniscient metaphor you can think of. And the subplot between the workers of Lunaca fits but in an unimaginative, convenient way. I must say that all of the performances were excellent (except Elijah Wood, but he didn't have much of a character anyway), particularly Winslet and Mark Ruffalo. Director Michel Gondry and his team of technicians give the movie an appropriately jittery, jagged rhythm and look. It feels like the work of a writer on anti-depressants and Valium filtered through the mind of a director on a 3-day caffeine binge. That's not necessarily a bad thing because without the energy and gimmickry that Gondry brings to the film, the emptiness of the conception would be all the more glaring. Don't believe the hype but don't discount the film altogether either. It seems that many people are discovering something profound in it.

464,5004388,2020-06-06,dr_clarke_2,Driving Miss Daisy (1989),8.0,"Bruce Beresford's 1989 Academy Award for Best Picture winner Driving Miss Daisy is basically a film about a rich Jewish widow gradually befriending her black driver. And that, in a nutshell, is it. But it was so well received and has endured so well for the simple reason that it's impeccably made and a joy to watch.
The story unfolds in an entirely predictable fashion, as the titular Miss Daisy Werthan crashes her car, prompting her son Boolie to insist on employing a driver for her in the shape of Hoke Colburn. She's not at all happy about this and even when she capitulates it takes her a long time to accept what she sees as Hoke's unwanted intrusion into her life; inevitably however, she grows to both respect and like him and they eventually form a touching friendship. None of this is Earth-shattering stuff, but it is compelling because the characters are so believably written and because the actors are so perfectly cast.
Jessica Tandy's Daisy is a lovely character, proud, stubborn and a bit eccentric. Morgan Freeman's Hoke is just as stubborn in his own way, gradually convincing Daisy to let him drive her through sheer persistence - he later tells Boolie ""It only took me six days, same time it took the Lord to make the world!"" She proves to be a terrible back-seat driver, finding fault with Hoke right up until she nearly accuses Hoke of stealing a tin of salmon, until he tells her that he ate it and has bought a replacement. It's a key moment in their relationship, but it's so subtle that it's easy to miss. From this moment on, Daisy becomes much warmer towards her new companion, as demonstrated by the lovely scene in the cemetery when he says he can't read and she teaches him on the spot on the basis that he at least knows the alphabet.
The remainder of the film charts their friendship, and like the tinned salmon moment, it is often very subtle. The dynamic between them changes in small increments, such as when Hoke firmly insists that if he needs to stop the car to use the toilet, then he will do whether Daisy likes it or not. Fiction meets real life when Miss Daisy goes to a dinner attended by Martin Luther King; Boolie suggests she take Hoke, but she makes a mess of inviting him, resulting in him angrily waiting outside and listening to the speech on the car radio. Later, as Miss Daisy develops dementia (Tandy giving a remarkably realistic performance), Hoke is ably to calm her down and the final scene is very poignant, as he visits her in a nursing home and helps her to eat her Thanksgiving pie.
There are other themes here too, most notably racism, which is handled with just as much subtlety as everything else: the Alabama policemen calling Hoke ""boy"" and demanding to know what he's doing with an expensive car is quietly understated, without detracting from its profoundly offensive nature. The synagogue bombing that draws parallels between the racism that Hoke experiences and anti-Semitism occurs off screen and Hoke learns of it from a policeman. It's that sort of film, in which everything of importance is relayed through dialogue.
Bruce Beresford is not a flashy director. That's probably why he didn't get a Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards, even though the film won Best Picture. But he has the workmanlike approach of an artisan, and he's content to let the performances drive the film. Peter James' cinematography is equal straightforward and therein lies its elegance, for example when close-ups of blossom are used to indicate the passage of time. The make-up used to age the characters is very impressive, and mention should also be made of Dan Ackroyd's supporting performance as Boolie, which is overshadowed only because Tandy and Freeman are so very good. The only aspect of the film that has aged badly is Hans Zimmer's score, performed electronically, which is a bit of an unwanted earworm. Overall, Driving Miss Daisy is one of the more modest Oscar winning movies, but it has lashings of charm and is deserving of its reputation as a modern classic.",705,0,,0,No reference

The film seems to have bi-polar disorder, switching from a happy violence, almost farcical comedy to heavy drama between (or sometimes even within) scenes. The dramatic elements were generally the most watchable parts of the movie -- at points we even feel some sympathy for the main character's plight. The comedic elements, on the other hand, seemed out of place, and way too far over the top to be actually funny, generally relying on something to be funny so long as it is shocking. Note to Hollywood: shock tactics only go so far. At some point you have to insert something which is actually funny outside of just being disgusting.As far as acting goes, most of it was BAD. Matt Dillon does his usual impression of a robot, backed up by Steve Zahn playing a completely unsympathetic manic asshole. The rest of the supporting cast is generally better than those two, but no performances stand out enough to warrant discussion.Then come the obligatory surprise endings. Yes, endings plural. I remember being willing to forgive the movie for its sins and say that I liked it and found it reasonably entertaining and thoughtful (maybe as high as 7 stars), but then we go to surprise ending number one.

He looked like the real Amin and I bought him as a brutal dictator. From reading other reviews, the doctor role was fiction and used to tell Amin's dictatorship though rose colored glasses. The doctor sees Amin with his kids at his nice house throwing pool parties. He pretends like he really doesn't know what is going on after hearing reports of people turning up missing in the country. And one of those guys is missing after Nickolas tells Amin he saw him conducting a suspicious meeting at a hotel. Nickolas wasn't exactly someone you root for since he goes after 2 married women and turns a blind eye to some of Amin's business.The story was entertaining and it didn't even have to show a lot of killings and mass graves that went on during Amin's tenure. There were a couple of scenes for shock value toward the end. One involving arms where legs should be and meat hooks. I had to turn away for that.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining, interesting, check it out.",185,1,non rating review,1,Reference to other reviews
469,1096587,2005-12-27,bob the moo,Dead Ringers (2002–2007),,"Beginning life on Radio 4, this show first came to my attention because John Culshaw used to be a regular on the Chris Moyles radio show back when I used to think he was worth listening to. At first glance it didn't really appeal to me because I was expecting something a lot more like Bremner, Bird & Fortune, by which I mean I was hoping it would be cleverer, sharper and not necessarily the sort of funny that makes you laugh but occasionally the uneasy feeling that the latter show can give you. However a few more viewings and I settled down into acceptance that Dead Ringers is not in the same arena as BB&F and that this is not necessarily a problem.DR tends not to be as sharp because it isn't really a satirical show (although it can be), it is more of a straight comedy show (although not totally to the degree of, say, Alistair McGowan). This mix of populist and political works quite well and produces some very good scenes with a good hit/miss ratio. It isn't always the smartest game in town but it makes for it by being roundly entertaining. It rarely has a point to make but rather just takes aims at public figures with general mockery. Hence we get things like Andrew Marr with his fantastically out-of-control arms or the simply dumb George Bush; it is rarely insightful but it works.The performers are all pretty talented and, although the visuals aren't always great, the voices are normally spot on. Culshaw relies a bit too heavily on the old stalwarts of Dr Who and Obi-Wan, but generally he is very good although I do get the impression that the general comic approach of the material is down to his influence. Ravens is usually the one that looks least like any of the people she is impersonating but she does get the voices really on target to compensate; with fewer females in target positions, she tends to take more of a support role at times but she is generally good. Cornwell isn't a great impressionist but he is very close and he has good delivery, Connelly is equally as good and Perry is good in most, if not all, of his roles.Overall this isn't a clever show or the satirical impressions that I've grown used to with BB&F but instead Dead Ringers is more generally amusing. Mocking and poking fun rather than being sharp and incisive puts it below BB&F in my book (despite actually being funnier) but for the majority of viewers this will do the job. A bit broad for my tastes but generally funny and entertaining.",445,0,,0,No reference

A wonder that Hollywood finally managed to create an intelligent, funny, emotional, esoterical, mysterious, philosophicalin short an all covering film that is really touching. In the first, somewhat overlong half the story is following the main hero Truman through his point of view and elaborating his quiet, normal life while the director Peter Weir is cleverly choosing strange camera angles to give the feeling as if he is being spy-ed by someone. In the second, and much more intriguing part, the story shifts to the outside"" world and to Christof's 10 mile wide studio from which Truman is being monitored by 5.000 cameras 24 hours a day for a TV show.--------------------- The themes of this sci-fi tragicomedy are quite fascinating existential ( finding out who we are and stopping anyone who wants to control our life ), philosophical ( what is real and what not? ) and even subversive ( the media changed the world so much that even a lie can pass as truth ). One of the best scenes is the one where Christof touches the sleeping Truman on the screen at night, creating a strange feeling how he is present in his life although he never met him!""The Truman Show"" deservedly won 3 Golden Globes for best score, main actor Jim Carrey and supporting actor Ed Harris, who was also nominated for an Oscar.Still, as much as I love it, I have to admit that the original shooting script by Andrew Niccol overshadows it. There we had a much more intimate storyline and original ideas. Some of the highlights there were that the location was New York (!), the scene where Truman accidentally discovers the word Trumanesque"" in the dictionary, the building of the fake town Sydney, Chloe's marching in into Christof's room and telling him that Truman didn't masturbate for 2 months, the dialog between a caller and Christof ( I enjoyed your work, Christof, but I can't say I saw all of it.""  Who can?"" ) or when Truman disguised himself while entering an xxx store all the while some two viewers had an ironic dialog ( What's with the disguise?""  Maybe he doesn't want to be recognized."" ). I can't understand why those scenes were deleted. True, the script ending is much weaker than the movie ending, but all in all it gives an better impression - and elaborates the plot more. It's sad because with that script this could have easily been even better.Grade: 9/10",435,0,,0,No reference

And the Morrison death scene too, which most likely came from a heroin overdose - but there is no sign of that in the film. (I'm no Doors expert btw, but I have read a few things here and there.)

476,1604309,2008-03-11,Zaptharo,Sanford and Son (1972–1977),9.0,"Growing up in the 1980s and early 1990s, I had no intentions to think of any show before that era. It's not that I didn't like them, I just felt that the shows I grew up on were the best. A couple of years ago I grew weary of the state of television and decided to find something that would satisfy my taste buds. When I found Sanford & Son being aired on TV Land, I was surprised. I never knew beforehand that so many good sitcoms came out of the 1970s, and this is no exception.Originally based off of ""Steptoe & Son"", Sanford & Son revolves around a junk dealer and his son living in a neighborhood in Watts, Los Angeles. Fred Sanford (Redd Foxx) is a sarcastic and stubborn person who's plans usually backfire, causing trouble. His son Lamont Sanford (Demond Wilson) usually has to complete tasks and order his own father to complete jobs. It was very amusing to see the two argue against each other and have to become loyal in order for things to come back to normal.But there are a couple other interesting characters in the series worth mentioning. Aunt Esther (LaWanda Page), who is sister of Fred Sanford's late wife Elizabeth, is a Baptist who just can't seem to handle Fred too well. In most cases they spew insults to each other such as ""Gorilla Face"" and ""Fish-Eyed Fool"", and what makes this funny is that it never gets old. I always found myself laughing whenever Fred gave Aunt Esther a dirty joke. Grady Wilson (Whitman Mayo), who is Fred's closest friend, usually acts as his ""sidekick"" and is involved in get rich schemes. Unfortunately, Redd Foxx left the show for some episodes (due to a feud with the producers) and thus Grady had to fill in, in order to watch the junk yard business. Many characters appear in the show, and not one of them is really that boring to watch.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the classic sitcoms, well before Cable TV and Reality TV started getting out of hand. I consider the 1970s to be the ""Golden Age of Sitcoms,"" because that was when barriers were broken and actors displayed their best talents to make themselves stand out. All in the Family, M*A*S*H, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Happy Days, Good Times, The Jeffersons, Three's Company, Different Strokes, Taxi, and numerous others. Sanford & Son puts most of the 1990s and 2000s sitcoms to shame. It was a stroke of genius, and Redd Foxx was a one of a kind individual. No one beforehand thought a stand up comic would be good in his own show. But he did it, in a big way. It's still a hit among old and young generations alike, and if Sanford & Son still lives on even after over 35 years, then you know that it's a classic. Like Archie Bunker, Fred Sanford is a unique person.So don't waste your time watching the Disney Channel or anything that comes out of Reality TV. Sanford & Son is a timeless sitcom that will keep you laughing. Highly recommended.9 out of 10.",527,0,,0,No reference

As commented by a few people before me: strong cast! This series of movies always had a good selection of actors, and the addition of Emma Thompson brings her special delicious style of humor, which I enjoyed. And so endeth the account of positive aspect(s).Browsed the headlines of other reviews to see whether I am the only one who finds fault with this production, and I am not.Found comments like ""Bridget Jones is fading"". I agree, there is a continuous decline in quality from the 1st to the 3rd installment. The story lines got more and more silly, making one want to ask ""did she lose contact with reality, or had she none to begin with?"" And replacing Hugh Grant with Patrick Depsey?! Seriously?! There were comments on the level of banality of the story like ""Middle Class Lady has Middle Class Baby (who cares?!)"" and indeed, who cares?! And it does not get rendered exciting by her not knowing who is the father, the potentials being her married ex and a complete stranger from a drunken chance encounter...What REALLY lifted my eyebrow was the 43(!) year old pregnant woman who completely ignores the need for prenatal diagnostics (amniocenthesis) and NO ONE, including the gynecologist seems to be alarmed by this. Nor does she have any concern since she seems to lack any information about the possible outcomes (where we are again at the ""does she have any contact with reality"" context). So, what is the message here? Is it ""ah well, even with a highly geriatric pregnancy, we need no prenatal testing, since - voila - all will be well, there will be the absolute perfect, most beautiful baby in the end anyway""????.

I have a rule that I go by that movies should not break the 150 minute mark unless there is a very good reason.  Granted, the plot is good enough to draw many viewers in for that long, but I though that some of the scenes were just embroidery, little more.The main reason why I didn't like this movie so much is the glaring fact that the whole Rose and Jack romance could never of happened in the first place!  Nobody is willing to acknowledge that fact.  It is historical fact that first class passengers on the Titanic or any other ship of the time period would fraternize in any way.

The film is no doubt bizarre, absurdist and almost entirely black-and white pseudo-documentary, with cameos by Grebenschikov and Kurekhin, occasional bursts of color and abstract cartoons. It roughly deals with the history of Russian fleet in the first two decades of twentieth century.Two things though keep me from treating as a ""schlockumentary"" - first, excellent, grim and haunting soundtrack by Kurekhin, and second, clever tongue-in-cheek funny monologues. You almost believe in what is said, said in a serious and solemn tone, only to understand that it all was a razor-sharp joke just played on you.Definitely this is not a film for everybody.

They also delivered on the flying scenes, emphasizing Superman's power (and his smile when first taking to the skies is infectious), not to mention some majestic cape shots. And it's also a good cast, they just need some actual meat to work with. Which brings me to the movie's greatest strength: the man wearing the tights. Henry Cavill makes for a terrific Superman, charismatic, and boasting a physique to weep openly over. He's absolutely the reason I'd watch a sequel, and I cannot speak highly enough of Cavill's turn in the role.But this material shouldn't be so dark.

It's easy to dismiss a movie that tries a little too hard to make you cry. You meet the title character (Robin Williams), an unconventional med student who wants hospital patients to be seen as people and not numbers, and you may think, ""Ha, I know where this is going, and it's not going to suck me in."" Well, it got me. When we first meet Patch, he's in trouble. A difficult childhood resulted in a suicide attempt, and now he's in a mental hospital. He cures himself by helping the other patients and, upon his release, Patch decides to become a doctor. He spends his years in med school railing against the impersonal approaches of fellow students and teachers, bucking convention, angering the establishment and going to extremes to brighten the lives of countless patients. Some may cringe at the sight of Patch donning a clown nose, or using bed pans as shoes in a childen's cancer ward. Yes, it's a bit syrupy, but it's done with warmth, and that is the key to buying into the whole tale...which is based on a true story. Williams exudes warmth. This is a tailor-made role for his offbeat charm and zaniness and, unless you're a total ogre, you can't help but like him. How much of the role is the real Patch, and how much is Williams being Williams is anyone's guess, but he skillfully blends wacky antics and heartfelt emotions. Of course, most of Patch's classmates disagree with his unusual treatments. They come around in the end...you knew that, right?

The scriptwriters use this technique a lot during this episode, and it is just irritating as the dickens. The desire to defend oneself is built in to honest people. Maybe they figured that people would accept the Japanese mind as being the opposite. To me, it didn't work. Also, all the ""know your place"" baloney may work out fine in family matters, but NOT in business. And this was all about business.Perry had to know, even before Tragg, that Kamuri's death was murder, because he asked about the red rug, and the robe. Why were the candles left burning after the police had come and gone? It was obviously someone in the Nichols house that was guilty after Alice admitted to framing Mitsou for theft, and then not having to courage and integrity to come forth about it when she saw what was happening because of it. I think they could have done a better job of making up Benson Fong for this part, or gotten an actual old guy to play the part; he was just not believable. This was makeup department's problem, brought about by casting. Fong is one of the greats, just not right for this part. I also think that since they were going to let the connection between Toma and Mitsou devolve into romance (gimme a break), the least they could do is have some inscrutable Japanese music playing in the background. You know, the kind that sound like psychedelic Ukeleles being played by Frank Zappa on acid??One thing I like about Perry, is the way they show how money (power) corrupts, and more money corrupts more people. Later, the great television program ""Law and Order"" continued this message. Della was wonderful, as usual, and frugal about the present for her aunt, (I think it was her aunt, anyway).

Blanchett, not being the most attractive woman in the entire world is perfectly cast as you find yourself watching her and finding her incredibly sexy - and just want to jump and say Oscar and Lucinda - you are so perfect for each other! The scene with Blanchett in the glass church is an amazing piece of acting.Gillian Armstrong (Little Women) triumphs with the breathtaking Australian and English countryside scenery, and certain shots just shouldn't work, but amazingly they do.Oscar and Lucinda is acting at it's best, and an amazing screenplay from such a dull, long-winded book.",192,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

495,918910,2005-03-13,Spondonman,The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939),8.0,"Up to now I've watched this about 10 times, taped off TV in 1988. Now I've seen it on DVD and it's as if this old friend of mine has suddenly been rejuvenated and left me to get decrepit on my own. Not a re-master but the best available print, preserved by UCLA.

To me the Rathbone/Bruce Holmes films were the best adaptations of Conan Doyle's stories, mainly because although I've read all of them I'm not a Holmes Purist and I've always preferred treatments of any story for that matter to come from the Golden Age. That sounds pretty limiting, but life is short and there's still plenty out there to see and read! Personally Rathbone was definitive as Holmes, Jeremy Brett in the '80's/'90's on UK TV was a close second but the programmes even though set correctly lacked atmosphere and the film quality was often irritatingly grainy. Peter Cushing was good too, but brought a Hammy energy to the role I couldn't quite get used to.

Fox did a great job with this film, which proved to be 1/14, the production values were consistently high, and attention to period detail unwavering. Apart from reducing costs the fogs on the back lots, sorry Moors lent the right atmosphere to this version of the tale. Hound also was responsible for the 200+ radio programmes throughout the '40's with Rathbone and Bruce, of which I still have about 140 left to hear!",242,0,,0,No reference

The ship is too big. And oh sometimes characters are literally in scenes when they were in real life half a world away. But none of that matters for this is a fine rousing adventure. Gable as Christian is a sensuous romantic hero. Laughton gives one of the great overstated performances of all time. His Bligh is cruelty, pettiness personified. Everyone else is very engaging as well.But for my money the best aspects of the film are the direction/technical ones. It is true that the effects are not seamless and all are quite dated. Likewise, the sets are all too large and the swaying motion of the ship is not consistent. But for all that Lloyd *does* transport you into the haul of the Bounty.

Ly's no-holds-barred direction makes sure that the tension is palpable, nail-biting & nerve-wracking and keeps the viewers alert & on the edge at all times.The plot addresses the ever-worsening relations between the cops & marginalised communities and derives its restless vibe from the animosity within various groups in the neighbourhood that the police keep walking into. Adding more fuel to the fire is the dynamic camerawork, cut-throat editing & fiery performances, and it all ends on a brutal but thought-provoking note.Overall, Les Misérables is as combustible as it is captivating in its depiction of how even a petty act can get out of hand and spiral into the threat of a large crisis.

Prior to that breakthrough role she was getting decent roles in quality movies such as Tonie Marshall's Venus Beaute where she could coast in the wake of a heavy hitter like Nathalie Baye and let her carry the movie. After Amalie it was of course Tautou herself who had to pick up the ball and run with it and the results have been mixed at best and along the way she has had to watch as others - Isobel Carre for example, in Romantics Anonymous - have excelled in roles tailor-made for Tautou. Delicacy helps restore the balance and despite the inexperience of a first-time director there is still sufficient charm on hand to lift it out of the run-of-the-mill and it does no harm at all to have Ariane Ascaride along for the ride albeit wasted and underused at one and the same time.

Set in an alternate present-day where humans, orcs, elves and fairies have been coexisting since the beginning of time, this follows two cops from very different backgrounds. Ward, a human and Jakoby, an orc , embark on a routine night patrol that will alter the future of their world as they know it.
The first thing you notice about this film is how great it looks. The make up and special affects really are stunning. The second is how old Will Smith is looking. 
The film itself is pretty good. I'm not a big lover of fantasy movies but because this is set in a modern day, gritty world it feels more relative.
I did prefer the first half where we follow the cops and they experience the prejudices amongst the public and their own colleagues more than the second half which is where the fantasy action goes into overdrive. Bright feels like a a cross between the 1988 film Alien Nation and the Underworld series of movies.

512,1974568,2010-06-06,jacob-l-williams,4.3.2.1. (2010),7.0,"4 3 2 1 is the latest film to come from the mind of Noel Clarke and right from the start it is obviously a film by him.The same snappy editing seen in Adulthood is once again present and the use of quick cuts to disorientate and confuse the audience is once again put to effective use in this intriguing and very well told story. The film is the type of film that I do not expect the mass public to like and pay to see, it is anti-main stream and proud. The narrative shows three days in the life of each of the four main girls as they each go about their business, it follows one girl at a time before rewinding and following a different girl, each time more being revealed about the characters and the situation.The film has little real plot as it is more of a character study of women (and crime) in Britain and has no real ending with a sort of cliff hanger that fails. A majority of the acting is also quite poor as the leads fail to give their characters the depth needed, the stand out performers are Ophelia Lovibond as the shy and troubled Shannon, and Noel Clarke in his role as the main villain.However despite all this it is still a film that I thoroughly enjoyed as Clark has once again written a script that captures drama and mixes it with comedy and has also used many techniques to give this film a very sleek finish and make it enjoyable to watch. I also enjoyed watching all the little cameos of famous people such as Ben Miller, Eve and Plan B. So in general if you take this film as a film then it is a failure in terms of narrative and performance, but very well made. However if like Clarke's previous films you view it as a social study on Britain it is very effective as within the four story lines Clarke tackles many subjects which young people in London encounter every day such as abortion, divorce, crime, drugs and even homosexuality (in a rather raunchy lesbian sex scene). The score helps Clarke put across his views on society as much like in Adulthood all of the songs are by contemporary R'n'B artists that perspective audience members will know and be able to connect to.After watching this I have to say that Clarke is become more defined in his film-making and script-writing abilities with each film he makes and the auteuristic qualities he brings to a film particularly in the editing; I just wish that one time he could hire some decent actors.7/10",444,0,,0,No reference
513,1695268,2008-09-07,johnnyboyz,1408 (2007),7.0,"The idea behind 1408 is actually kind of cute; a sort of 'what if' scenario based on what might happen if an inanimate object was given life. We've all seen Child's Play and perhaps the less than desired sequels but here, the inanimate object given life and then forced to fall into the horror genre is a motel room  a neat and effective idea. Following on from other such Stephen King adaptations, 1408 adopts the approach of putting someone in an individual location and then allowing events to unfold around them without ever letting them leave: it can be a prisoner in The Shawshank Redemption in a prison; a crippled author trapped in a lodge in Misery or a haunted motel room you cannot escape from as seen here.1408 begins with an immediacy; a false immediacy that caught me off guard and worked really well. We get John Cusack's character Mike Enslin driving in the rain, at night and clearly lost  an easy, easy set up for a horror film but what follows is him finding the motel he was looking for, staying the night and leaving the next day in some disappointment  it is an anticlimax, for the character as well as for us as we have been led down a route of suspecting the film will begin its scares from the very off with a familiar set up before having everything cancelled and having the film cut to some bright, colourful shots of people surfing.But the subject matter and choice of editing is the secret here and it mirrors the idea the director has for the anti-climax. A dark, wet and 'spooky' for the genre night is juxtaposed for shots of the sea and surfers going about their business in bright sunshine. In fact the film goes on and has its ghost hunting author of the lead role state that he hasn't ever actually even seen a ghost, which further adds to the now dead and unsuspecting atmosphere the film has decided to lay onto us. It's these early mind-games and cancelling out what we take for granted that kicks the film off wonderfully well, setting up things to come.But Mike is drawn to a hotel called The Dolphin, and its infamous room 1408 from which the film gets its title. 1408 is a doomed, cursed room that keeps its inhabitants and renders them insane over time by basically erasing them from the face of the Earth; either that or erasing the face of the Earth around them so that the room and the individual are the only things that seem to exist. But while the film is not flawless, the exchanges and that initial thirty to forty minute trip once inside the room has more than enough ammunition to label this a successful horror film. The pleasantries and the introductions are done in a very urgent and dismissive manner; hotel hot-shot Gerald Olin (Jackson) doesn't build the room up prior to entry in a 'be careful' or a 'it's dangerous' mannerism but goes the whole hog and simply tells Mike it's a death trap and he will not survive, period.The funny thing is that we have no reason to believe anything that initially happens in room 1408 is really all that bad. The film has given us a series of scenes prior to the main course of a night in 1408 that do not have anything to do with the horror genre, at least not conventionally: they consist of a beach scene where people surf; a public book signing and a scene in which the lead character checks their mail  how many horror films would usually have their lead check their mail before heading off for the film's main plot strand? But this is what's clever about 1408, the 'scares' at the early stage consist of window's accidentally shutting on the individual's hand; taps breaking off and spraying water everywhere and the alarm radio randomly coming on to the tune of The Carpenters.So these events could just be coincidence, indeed even Mike comes to the conclusion he has been drugged through the whiskey and complimentary mint after all the fancy build up and is imagining it all, he and us have good reason to believe it could all be fake. One of the other reasons 1408 works is because of its protagonist and how strong and independent they are  the hero here is not some teenager whose reason to exist is so that they can be chased by a knife wielding maniac, Mike is a smart man who seeks these sorts of situations down and indeed uses several methods to calm himself down when everything feels a little too real  he is rational and realistic.Although the best bit about 1408 is what you might come to realise afterwards in the sense it could be a metaphorical journey for Mike given what revelations and problems arise, to do with domestic issues, later on. 1408 is his purgatory where he is forced to confront his past demons; it's a metaphor for coming to terms with what happened and who he is, especially after so many monotonous mis-fires in this job as an author. 1408 is a creepy and unnerving film that also comes across as quite smart.

From the outset, the Set Design was a miss as I can't imagine a mystery writer living in a cold, stark concrete and steel mausoleum. Writers do research, they read books, lots of books, and not all are available via the internet, no matter what techies would have you think. Andrew Wyke would have a huge library available to himself within easy reach. The only books on that set were supposedly written by Wyke himself.The camera direction was not comfortable to watch as it was inferred we were watching things unfold through the security camera's. An interesting idea until some of camera's appeared to be tracking the subjects. Good trick, but only if the subjects are wearing tracking devises. They weren't. I have a hard time watching images that only show part of the subject as was the case at the start. It makes me pay attention to the camera and not the story. This is a trick of music video directors when they don't have much of a story to tell but still have to fill the time allotted. Branagh had a great story to tell, just not much of a script.Micheal Caine is a fine actor but when held up to Sir Laurence Olivier's Andrew Wyke, he is left lacking. Jude Law does a fine job with the character he was given but he still didn't outdo Caines original. The entire film was not long enough to give any good character development nor was there good use of the grounds as in the 72' version.If you have never seen the 1972 Sleuth, you may be excused for really enjoying this copy, but if you have seen the older one you will not be able to watch this without making comparisons.",318,0,,0,No reference

Nostalgia can be a double-edged sword, or in this case, a double-edged Trojan sword. It cuts both ways. We have an insatiable urge for a newer model, one that has similar traits that were once deemed endearing and comforting. Yet we somehow yearn for a better more refined chassis. Simply put, what was formerly our beloved past blurs our more-than-real present. The latest facsimile simply cannot compete with our fondest memories of our past experiences. ￼Most sequels fail for that reason, even if there is much thought and care put into that revised reincarnation. Mr. Peabody and Sherman is the latest victim. Yes, technically the colors are more sharper, and there is more visual depth and detail. Even 3-D techniques have been applied to enhance this final product. Gone are the simple outlines, outdated animation, and flat washed-out colors of the 60's versions. Unfortunately also gone are the wit and fun of the original. Instead we have more plot about Mr. Peabody's parenting skills and a preachy message about the importance of family as the adventurous duo go Waybac and meet various historical characters and events. Some naysayers may even say a hidden liberal agenda with the new normal family unit runs deep in this film. (I wouldn't though.) What ran deep for me is a wistful feeling of my childhood, sitting in front of the television watching my Saturday morning cartoons. Allow me to digress here. Animated cartoons of my past like Quick Draw McGraw, Beany and Cecil, Magilla Gorilla, Underdog and Sweet Polly Purebread, and Huckleberry Hound come into mind. Not to mention other diversions on view back then: shows like Yogi Bear, Top Cat, The Flintstones, Mister Magoo, Winky Dink and Me, and The Jetsons. (Ah, the glorious past!)￼And of course, the quintessential Rocky and His Friends, from 1959, was the staple of my childhood upbringing. This particular program became my personal rite of passage into more adult humor, with the cleverest of word play, puns, and jokes that I was just beginning to understand. The cartoons on that show included classic characters like Rocky J. Squirrel,and Bullwinkle J. Moose, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, and segments like Dudley Do-Right, Fractured Fairy Tales (my favorite), Mr. Know-It-All, and Peabody's Improbable History, the story of a dog and his pet boy. It was Peabody's comical and abridged history lessons that inspired me to read up about the myths and legends as a child. Those cartoon shorts were quick-witted satire and the real hidden agenda of childhood education at its finest,before the advent of Sesame Street. It taught me everything I know and more.￼The 2014 version never reaches that level of excellence but is still entertaining and even highly amusing, sans the magic and charm. Many of the sight gags fall flat and the humor is of the hit-and-miss variety,but at least they tried. The artistry and craft is state-of-the-art, with fine voice-over support by Ty Burrell. Max Charles, Ariel Winter, Stephen Colbert, Leslie Mann, and especially Allison Janney and Patrick Warburton working overtime. Well directed by Rob Minoff, Mr. Peabody and Sherman may indoctrinate today's child into the world of yesterdays and long agos as it once did for me. Yet I'd rather have them (and myself) see the classic original outdated animation of a bygone era, with its simple outlines and flat washed- out colors, beautifully intact.

My husband and I found ourselves drumming our fingers and watching our watches, wondering when the story was either going to start or when the movie was going to end. They had good actors doing a good job with what parts they had, but just didn't give them much dialog. This was probably one of the easiest scripts that any of these actorshave ever had to learn, given the lack of dialog. The characters move from city to city and scene to scene with little or no motivation or explanation. Villains come and go, each one vanquished after a long, hard to follow chase or fight scene.

First the positives; Jackson obviously knows how to make a little go a long way and extract multiple mileage out of a simple idea, ergo, we open on a montage of Hoovervilles, soup-kitchens etc as Al Jolson bellows 'I'm Sitting On Top Of The World' which is not only irony but anticipates the finale with Kong atop the Empire State building and bellowing not quite so loud as super-ham Jolie. The opening is all about desperation, from the starving jobless in general to Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) and her actor friends specifically and then the desperation of those like Carl Denham (Jack Black) and his crew who DO have jobs but are about to lose them, which segues nicely into Denham's desperation to 1)flee the country one jump ahead of the moguls he has conned, 2) find a replacement leading lady at a minute's notice, 3) convince the captain (Thomas Kretschman to weigh anchor like NOW, Man and 4) con writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) into remaining on board til the ship is underway. Black's interior sweating recalls Oscar Muldoon (a great performance by Edmond O'Brien) in The Barefoot Contessa and there's a nice touch in the poster that Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler), a rugged Rock Hudson type sticks on his cabin wall heralding his appearance in Rough Trader and when Baxter is seen fleeing in terror on Skull Island insiders will recognise the reference to Richard Barthelmess an actor who made his name in aviation movies whilst being terrified to fly. Watts is fully believable as the naive trouper - a contradiction in terms if ever there was one - who instinctively runs towards Kong for protection from the T-Rex or whatever. The ludicrous note is that despite several close encounters with rough terrain and even rougher predators she manages to keep her clothes intact which defies logic especially in 2005 when no one is going to object to a little non-sexual nudity. On the negative side the natives disappear without trace once they have served their purpose of capturing Ann as a sacrificial offering and all of a sudden Jackson, who has been content to give us a blow-by-blow up to now, cuts from the chloroformed Kong to several months later when he's the main attraction on Mazda Lane. Clearly it would have been embarrassing to attempt to show Kong being transported in a ship his weight alone would probably sink to say nothing of there being no suitable restraints on board - perhaps foolishly Jackson allows Denham to draw attention to the size and strength of the restraints attached to Kong in the theatre, restraints which he had little trouble throwing off so how did they get him back?

Finders Keepers is an authentic good-old boy documentary set in North Carolina about rednecks John Wood and Shannon Whisnat, the former storing his amputated leg in a smoker grille in a storage unit. The latter buys the smoker at auction and wants to keep it to peddle his fame while John wants it back because it is his connection to his dad.The challenge with the material is for educated audiences not to feel superior to the Crackers on the edge of insanity struggling with their demons, John alcoholism and Shannon fame. Shannon's plight is the more pathetic of the two, an overweight dreamer who pursues reality-show fame as if it were his destiny.As we watch family members--sisters, mothers, wives-- themselves redneck real, there seems no way out of their unsophistication, yet there is. John laments the furor over the leg--he goes on a Judge show with Shannon to fight legally for possession--and turns his energy to sobriety. Shannon sees he's the butt of jokes on the reality circuit and while disconsolate seems to be entering a sober phase of his life.Whether or not the filmmakers manipulate to make the subjects denser than they are is arguable, but they sure have some witty observations: About John, Shannon says, ""He was born with a silver crack pipe in his mouth."" There's a cinema verite feel to the proceedings, recognition that even these down-home characters have arcs leading to self-awareness. Too many fiction movies don't do that.",262,0,,0,No reference

It stars Jock Mahoney, Martha Hyler, Lyle Bettger and David Janssen. Music is by Joseph Gershenson and photography by Irving Glassberg.Plot has Mahoney as Jim Trask, a former Sheriff of Abilene who returns home from the Civil War with a guilty conscience and a new contempt for guns. Compounding his troubles is that his old friend Dave Mosely (Bettger) has taken up a romantic relationship with his girl, Peggy Bigelow (Hyer), and he soon learns that Dave is also into villainous activities. Can Trask overcome his troubles and restore order to Abilene and his life?Better than average and competently acted, Showdown at Abilene is a solid time filler for the undemanding Western fan. Although thoughtful in its treatment of the characters, formula dictates there are no surprises and comparisons are easily drawn to better Westerns with the same thematics. Mahoney (TV series The Range Rider) turns in a good show as the emotionally perturbed Trask, while as a stuntman by trade he isn't found lacking in the physical demands of the role as he leaps around with exciting conviction. Hyer (The Sons of Katie Elder) is pretty as a picture as serves the story well as a rose between two thorns, while Bettger (Gunfight at the O.K. Corral) scores favourably as the crafty Dave Mosely. Not faring so well is Ted de Corsa (also Gunfight at the O.K. Corral) as Dan Claudius, who looks (and is) wrong for prime villain duties. Shot primarily out of Morrison Ranch, Agoura in California, picture sadly is lifeless in colour, so we never get to see the locale and costuming come to life. Producer Howard Christie liked the story so much he re-made it eleven years later as 'Gunfight in Abilene', where Bobby Darin starred as the conflicted lead character.Nothing overtly impressive here, nor anything particularly damning either.

The plot is contrived and full of childish, simplistic clichés, too many to number. Disney is on its war path destroying anything remotely decent. Turning the magical ""The Snow Queen"" by G.H. Andersen into the abominable ""Frozen"" wasn't enough apparently. I'm cringing at a thought those butchers may get to one of Miyazaki's classics one day. (Spoilers) The plot had many questionable spots, but my biggest question was why for the love of God Hiro couldn't make the second neuro-band to try and take back control over his microbots? He went at length to turn himself and his clumsy friends into the super-heroes, but somehow decided that building an army of his own microbots was a waste of time? I don't even want to point out that 4 additional heroes were utterly useless and goofy, and why even mention the fact that Hiro appears in so obviously intellectually superior to any other character in this movie, yet he wanted to go to school and study. Robert Callaghan is chosen to be a villain because his daughter presumably died during failed experiment by Alistair Krei (what a silly name, Aleister Crowley was definitely an inspiration so we would think he's an ultimate evil), but of course she hadn't died. Baymax is as cute as Dupey and speaks like Dilbert. He's the only slightly meaningful character but thanks to such a predictable, contrived plot even he becomes annoying. His looks are a mix of Kung Fu Panda and Marvin from the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. I wonder if his brain is as big as Marvin's.

This seemed to be one of those movies that people either insisted was a cinematic masterpiece or the worst movie ever. I'll admit ahead of time that I haven't really liked most of Nicolas Winding Refn's movies. I didn't like Bronson despite the great job by Tom Hardy, I thought Drive was alright. I haven't seen Only God Forgives and after seeing this, I don't have any desire to. I can't say that there's nothing here and I have seen worse movies but unless you're a big Winding Refn fan or a cinematography junkie, I don't know if anyone in the general audience is going to get much out of this.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After the opening credits (which start with Nicolas Winding Refn's name) we join Jesse (Elle Fanning) when she's wrapping up a small scale photo shoot in an L.A. apartment. She's cleaning herself off when Ruby (Jena Malone) introduces herself. Ruby is a makeup artist working in the studio that night. She welcomes her into town and tries to make small talk with her. Jesse is nervous and isn't very forthcoming. Ruby tells her how beautiful she is and invites her to a party. They meet up with 2 of Ruby's friends Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee) who are also models. They're industry vets and their explicit conversations kind of throw Jesse off. Everyone is impressed by Jesse's beauty and wherever she walks, people turn and stare. After being signed by Roberta Hoffman (Christina Hendricks) she goes on a date with the photographer from her first photo shoot Dean (Karl Glusman). They seem pretty at ease around each other and Jesse tells him some of her story. She's actually 16 when she's been lying and saying she's 18 or 19. Her parents have unfortunately passed away and that one of the reasons she came was because she felt she had little talent other than being pretty. At the end of the date, Dean tries to make a move but Jesse brushes him off and heads up to her motel room to get ready for a shoot the next day.Nicolas Winding Refn's movies usually have one thing in common, they're visually impressive. I'll give The Neon Demon something, it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in a while. There's a bunch of scenes that are just visually insane. The movie gives you almost zero context on what they mean or why they chose to do that but they are pretty.As much as I didn't like the movie I don't want to blame the actors and actresses. I don't think anyone was especially good but the whole vibe of the movie is so sterilized and lifeless, it really seems like they were directed or told to act that way. Elle Fanning was fine, she seems well cast but there isn't much subtlety to her performance. She goes from a shy newcomer to a arrogant %^&*# almost instantly at the half way point. Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote and Abby Lee seem appropriate for this movie but they're also so robotic they don't seem like real people at all. Christina Hendricks is in the movie for so little time it's almost worth not mentioning. Keeanu Reeves is appropriately creepy but that's not so much do to his acting as it is his character being just so disgusting.Getting to the heart of the matter, I found this movie to be really boring and all the insane visuals in the world couldn't save it. The movie also seems to have an ego, it's done in a really stylistic way to seemingly distract from the complete lack of substance. People have defended this movie saying it doesn't have to seem like reality because its meant to be more like a dark fairy tale. If that's the plan, give me some remotely likable characters that I want to see succeed. I really didn't give a crap whether Jesse made it or not, sure the gruesomeness of what happens to her isn't earned but when it happened I did think to myself that she probably had something like that coming. Or how about a deeper story instead of flashing symbols in neon when there isn't the proper explanation to understand what the movie wants to get across? There's really almost nothing to this movie from a plot perspective. Its almost ironic because the movie turns out to be as shallow as its characters. When the movie finally switches gears and puts the pedal to the floor for the finale, it's not only stupid but kind of gross and needlessly violent. I'm not saying that the direction that they took was wrong because I knew it was a horror movie going in. The problem is that it turns super dark on a dime and the depth of the horror aspects doesn't seem to work with the rest of the movie.I was ready to give this movie a chance. The polarizing opinions on it actually gave me some hope, I didn't like some of Refn's work previously but even some of the critical community seemed to turn their nose up at this. Maybe that meant it might be my kind of thing this time. I did appreciate the quality of the visuals but while that normally helps the grade that your going to give the movie most of the time, when a movie is aggressively bad it almost makes you dislike it more. I had the same reaction when I saw The Spirit (which is one of my least favourite movies of all time). I think the strong art-house crowd will dig this and they're welcome to it. For me, this will probably be one of the worst movies I've see this year.",975,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

547,1357557,2006-12-24,douglas2k4,Love.Com: The Movie (2006),7.0,"When dealing with manga-to-movie adaptations (or any adaptation for that matter), the director and his staff have to be very careful with the material that they have at their disposal. When all is said and done, and the film is released, the reaction to it can lead numerous paths. For instance, the film could be a disservice to the original fan base, displeasing hardcore fans alike. On the flip side, the film could also follow the route of being a faithful adaptation that could win over new fans as well as please the existing fans. ""Love Com"" is the rare case where the film is neither considered a ""fan service"" or ""fan disservice"", at least when I viewed it.

The film's storyline is the reiteration of the manga ""Lovely Comlex"". The main quirk of the manga is its two protagonists, Risa Koizumi and Atsushi Otani, who although with their considerable height differences, begin to fall for one another. In the film version, Risa is played by model Ema Fujisawa while Atsushi is played by singer and drama star Teppei Koike. The casting was a highlight for the film, with each of the lead roles, as well as the supporting cast, providing an accurate outwardly depiction of the manga cast. The use of vibrant colors throughout the film as well as the creative costume designs were also highlights of the film. Where the film falters though is the incredibly overreacting acting from the cast. Each character is so widely animated it gets to be a little irritating after awhile. I understand the use of facial expressions in order to express to the viewer what the character is going through, but the over abundant use just wears out over time. Combine this with a plot that is so thin, you can guess what happens next, and you got yourself a ticket to cinema clichéville.

Speaking of the cliché nature of the film, the film starts out promising enough, but then soon drivels into absurdity. For a film that harps so much on the height difference of its protagonists, it soon drops all that in favor for your standard trivial ""boy and girl don't like each other at first, but then slowly begin to fall for one another"" plot. In the end, the movie felt like one long Japanese television drama episode, which isn't a bad thing, but they could've done a lot more.

This is a quirky film, and you will probably have to be in the right mood to watch it. Not a film I would recommend to newcomers, (just stick to reading the manga first, then watch) but it's a film that should please some fans, but I imagine not all. Not entirely bad, ""Love Com"" does what it needs to do, and that is provide the laughs, which is one thing it does right.

548,1502152,2007-08-26,The_Void,"Anna, quel particolare piacere (1973)",7.0,"Secrets of a Call Girl is a rather odd Italian crime film as instead of focusing on the usual areas - shootings, car chases, fist fights etc, we focus on the hard done to girlfriend of a mobster; Anna, played by Edwige Fenech. The film is, therefore, is something like a cross between a crime drama and a romantic drama and in my opinion, it doesn't quite gel together - but that's not to say that this isn't a good film. The title implies that this will be a 'confessional' drama and implies that the central character is a prostitute, though that is somewhat misleading. As mentioned, the plot focuses on Anna; a young girl who works in a café. She goes from rags to riches when she catches the eye of Guido; an Italian mobster who takes her out of the café and into the gangster life. She soon realises that all that glitters is not gold when she witnesses a mob hit and the boss wants her silenced. Guido then decides to push her into prostitution, but when he is caught by the law; she decides to escape him and makes a new life with her son and a doctor.Edwige Fenech takes the lead role and does brilliantly with it. Her role here requires her to a little more than just take her clothes off, and she rises to the occasion well. It's easy to forget that she can act considering her roles in many of her films, so Secrets of a Call Girl serves as a nice reminder! The film also features performances from Corrado Pani, Richard Conte and John Richardson, who all do a good job in supporting roles. Giuliano Carnimeo takes the directors chair and does a good of directing Fenech for the second time, after The Case of the Bloody Iris. It has to be said that this film is more than a little slow at times, especially compared to other similar genre films owing to the fact that the focus is more on Fenech's character rather than the mob activities. However, this is not always a bad thing. I can't say that I'm a big fan of Romance films, but Fenech does enough to light up the screen every time she's on it and the film never becomes boring. It all boils down to a powerful ending that actually does have an impact. Overall, I'm not crazy about this film; but it's a good entry into Fenech's resume and it gets my recommendation.",420,0,,0,No reference
549,2484553,2013-07-01,luci-526-852757,Hit & Miss (2012),10.0,"I find this series has a lot in common with The Sopranos: outrageous, in-your-face violence, yes. Characters who seem impossible to love, yet whose humanity and character evolve over time and earn their way into your heart and psyche, yes. Phenomenal acting from an ensemble cast, yes. The contrast between complete disregard for (a stranger's) life alongside complete familial devotion and regard, yes. Strange, compelling beauty even in utter violence, yes, that, too.Chloe Sevigny, once again, is phenomenal. The young actors, particularly the two youngest, are consummate professionals already, completely believable and lovable, yet complex. And the teenage characters are, as any reasonably honest depiction of teenagers, alternately infuriating and inspiring compassion. The only character I found too flat and one- dimensional was John, our initial antagonist, but his family *may* make up for it, if they continue with a second season in line with the first.Mia's is a family who has seen and experienced life very different from what most reviewers will ever experience: it's unfair to compare their lives to ours. And I expect that it's unfair to compare too closely the experience of Mia as a transgender person as other transgender people in our neighborhoods (unless, of course, your transgender friends are also freakishly beautiful and skilled hired guns).Nevermind the homophobes who believe that there can be nothing good about this series because of its focus on a transgender person (and please don't believe that transgender=gay because it doesn't). Obviously, this is not a show to watch with small children in the room, mostly for the violence and disregard for human life. Even at my age, I prefer to watch by the light of day rather than right before bedtime. And yes, the sex is pretty explicit but not quite hardcore (think ""R"" not ""X""). We see Mia in full-frontal nudity regularly, but it's all about the plot, not gratuitous. And almost all the characters are quite liberal with their language, with the F-bomb flying everywhere all the time, so in addition to not letting kids *see* this show, be careful about them listening from around the corner if you're concerned about that sort of thing.I think it all adds up beautifully, myself. And come to think of it, in contrast with the vast majority of crime shows on TV in the U.S., it's refreshing to have a female killer and male victims, instead of vice versa.",400,0,,0,No reference

This is a movie that I can neither recommend but can't dissuade you from either.The story is pretty good. An astronaut named Spencer (Johnny Depp) and his partner trapped in space after an explosion and for a short time contact is lost. Depp's wife (the captivating Chareze Theron) waits for what seems like an eternity for information. Turns out he is alive but in a coma. He wakes up, gets out of the hospital and he and Jillian go home.But something isn't right about him. He just seems odd. Jillian sees him carrying on conversations with strangers and then brushing off her inquiries.In a movie like this it is almost impossible to get around the tired old plot device of having someone who works for an agency trying to get information out while his life is in danger. In this case he is played by Joe Morton as one of those sweaty, breathless guys who says things like 'I don't have much time'. I liked it better when Spencer's behavior was mystery that was slowly developing. I like to figure things out like this for myself, I don't like them explained.Jillian digs deeper and finds that the secret is buried in her own body. I liked Theron's performance as a woman who gradually begins to realize the gravity of her own situation. She is one of the rare actresses who can panic very well. I liked this character and hoped the movie wouldn't cop out on me. I did not however like Johnny Depp's performance. He comes off as one of those cold villains that speaks in a soft menacing voice and we are never given the opportunity to wonder if he is himself or if it's all in Jillian's head.The movie loses it's nerve in the last half hour. I found the ending to be confusing and trapped itself in tired old clichés with a special effects light and laser show that I have seen over and over and over.What I appreciated about 'The Astronaut's Wife' was the way that the is allowed tension build, at least for a while. There are just as many thing wrong with the movie as there are right. I wish that I could lean one way or another but this movie has me at a loss.

Baz's R+J was my fave film but I must say this wonderful film has now taken its place. This film is so brilliant because of its ability to make you laugh one minute, and cry the next. It's a very simple love story set against a backdrop of amazing visuals and breathtaking dance sequences. I still see something new every time I watch this film - it is a real feast for the eyes. I was also very shocked but equally impressed by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices. Yes, the songs are not new but you really don't notice that because of the stunning and unusual way the film is shot. They may as well be new songs because Ewan and Nicole cast them in a whole new light. Personally, I find the fast and shaking camera shots make the film much more interesting and inventive and anyone who cannot handle them is simply a 'lazy watcher' who cannot be bothered to concentrate hard enough to work out the different scenes.

After such disappointments like ""Can of Worms,"" ""Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century,"" and the awful ""Smart House,"" to name a few, I didn't think Disney could make a decent TV movie. But here it is! This movie really is genius. Instead of going from cheap comedy and typical overblown plots, Disney made something that is nice and, most importantly, can make this stone-faced critic laugh a lot. Thirteen-year-old Charlie Boyle is a hockey-loving whiz kid so smart that he has been offered the chance to go to college early, to study, experiment, and even teach. naturally, he has a hard time fitting in with the college students, especially his hockey player roommate, who is in the physics class Charlie teaches. One day, he meets a girl and falls instantly in love, but, always being seen as a nerd and not having much success in the past with such matters, he pretends to be a trouble-maker and enrolls at the junior high the girl attends. Thus begins the fun as Charlie must constantly switch from one identity to the next so his lie is not discovered.
So how did Disney do it? How did they make something funny? Well, the cast is great, especially young Trevor Morgan as Charlie, who has some very clever and quick lines. A script that doesn't fall into embarrassing, unfunny, cliched situations for another, which is so typical for this type of Disney movie.

One of the inmates (Viggo Mortensen) helps break down a sealed execution room, which unleashes the spirit of a previously killed convict and soon strange murders are happening throughout the prison.PRISON is a film I skipped for over two decades because I thought the story just sounded downright stupid. There's certainly egg on my face because while the story is lacking and there are some major flaws here and there, for the most part this is a pretty well-made film that manages to have some very good performance and a terrific atmosphere. A lot of credit has to go to director Renny Harlin who made this just before A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 and three years before breaking into the mainstream with DIE HARD 2.What works so well with this movie is the atmosphere created by the director. The rundown prison makes for a wonderful setting and I thought the entire thing had a rather authentic feel. Just watching the film you could really feel yourself inside these prison walls thanks in large part to the atmosphere, which is perfectly captured by some very good cinematography. The cinematography also works extremely well during the murder scenes where all sorts of crazy stuff is usually happening. The death sequences here are original to say the least, although they're certainly a lot different than the type horror fans were wanting to see during this period.Speaking of which, it's easy to see why PRISON didn't get too much love when it was originally released. Released during the era of slashers, I'm not sure how many people wanted to see a haunted prison movie and especially one that didn't feature that many gory deaths. What death scenes are here are quite unique but I'm sure most people were wanting Jason and Freddy. Not some invisible killer. As much as I enjoyed the majority of the film, there are still some problems including the story that really doesn't add up to much. Another problem is that the 102-minute running time starts to drag a bit towards the end.Another good thing working for the film are its performances with Smith being extremely good in his role as the warden. I thought he did a very good job and delivered an intense performance, which is going to remind many of the one Tommy Lee Jones gave in NATURAL BORN KILLERS several years later. Mortensen also does a very good job leading the film and it's easy to see even here that he was destined to become a strong actor.

571,2678585,2014-06-15,Tin_ear,World War Z (2013),6.0,"The zombie genre is dangerously overexposed at the moment. For the last ten years filmmakers have churned them out, in what is mostly motivated by the basest of financial considerations. Luckily World War Z takes the zombie concept in a slightly different direction than traditional films. In the same vein as 28 Days Later, only on a global scale, WWZ is arguably the culmination and most fitting depiction of the concept of the ""Zombie Apocalypse,"" and one hopes its final reiteration. While it is too deeply flawed to really recommend to anyone outside zombie and action fans, the zombie genre couldn't hope for a better send off.

The film is reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh's Contagion only much less dull. Though Contagion had the advantage of having an interesting antagonist, it also got bogged down telling one too many personal stories. In the end, Brad Pitt's central character, as unrealistic and epically significant he is in WWZ, is compelling enough to hold our attention. This movie doesn't really necessitate a bad guy, though a little more characterization might have helped. There are some good cameos I must say, but Pitt is what holds together this shambolic travelogue of a story. And considering the situation, his blunt exposition never seems forced. His character's simple mantra and guiding survival tactic (always keep moving) defines the attitude of the film. No one could accuse this reworked script of being too talky, that's for certain. As action sequences goes, it is quite striking.

But the film's problems are evident in its generic clichés and predictability. Brad Pitt's character is essentially a superhero, which in any other movie wouldn't be a problem however in a movie that stresses gritty realism and a foundation in hard science it just seems awkward. One scene in particular will test your suspension of disbelief, and maybe even ruin the film for you. As I mentioned before, the film was adapted from the book of the same title, and its ending reworked at the last moment. Whether the new ending played better than the original we may never know, but the tonal shift from bombastic to more subdued climax makes sense. The film would have been well served to provide us the opportunity to absorb and process what we seeing more often.

My only real complaint is that it never differentiates itself from the rest of the genre in any meaningful way, content to rely upon established zombie mythos and imagery found in any video game or B-horror. Though initially shocking in their animalistic disregard for their own bodies much like some swarming insect, the film none the less makes use of countless stock grayish, growling zombies, last-second escapes, and flickering fluorescent lights. In the decade since the masterpiece that was 28 Days Later, nothing in the zombie formula has really changed; good enough proof that the zombie phenomenon should probably cut its losses while it's still ahead.",487,0,,0,No reference

574,2815506,2015-02-14,Rickting,Final Destination 2 (2003),6.0,"Most film reviewers probably have an anomaly; a film or film series which they shouldn't like but do. The Final Destination films are mine. While the acting and writing are painful at times, the premise is intelligent and they're more effective than they're given credit for. Final Destination 2 sees a wimpy young woman(Alex Browning she ain't) foresee a hideous car pile up. She stops various people who were meant to die from getting onto the road, but death is not happy and soon starts claiming their lives in gruesome, gory Rube Goldberg machine style freak accidents. Gore hounds, you've met your match. This is weaker than it's highly underrated predecessor and is the 2nd worst in the franchise, although it's certainly not a bad film. The FD flicks were my first horror films and I used to be a big fan. I'm not as big a fan now, but they still hold up. FD 2 is not a scary film, but with a scare tool box of a log truck, a ladder, a window, a lift, a pipe, barbed wire, hospital equipment and a barbecue it is a surprisingly effective film. With it's dark atmosphere and suspenseful tone, you will be on the edge of your seat throughout.The thing which lets FD 2 down is the acting, which is awful. Ali Larter has improved a bit, Tony Todd is in full on creepy mode (In a good way) and 2 of the survivors, a stoner and a high school teacher, and reasonably well played. However, AJ Cook is a terrible lead, and most of the other acting performances are awful. Even though these people are seeing things which would traumatize a person for life, they look like they're watching Halloween cartoon for kids. The script is weak, with a lot of exposition and the characters in general aren't as likable as the survivors in the first film. The writing, acting and predictability of the plot weigh this down, but FD 2 is still a solid sequel. It's dark, creative and often genuinely tense. While it may lack a really good finale, there's still plenty of tension throughout. The car pile up is the best car crash scene in cinematic history as far as I'm concerned, and although this sequel makes no secret of the fact it's about the deaths rather than plot, it'll satisfy the gore thirsty fans and provide plenty of ghoulish thrills for many, myself included. They shouldn't have killed off Clear Rivers though.6/10",417,0,,0,No reference
575,1018628,2005-08-23,nycritic,Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star (2002 TV Movie),10.0,"Turner Classic Movies, the channel responsible of all films Classic, played this documentary on August 22, on their salute to Joan Crawford, and aptly sandwiched it between her worst movie at MGM, ABOVE SUSPICION, and her Oscar winning MILDRED PIERCE which has become to be regarded as a classic of soap-noir.The documentary, narrated by Anjelica Huston and with commentaries by numerous actors and directors who worked with Crawford as well as some darker tidbits by (who else) Christina Crawford, brings forth what is essentially the exact thing Joan played on-screen: a rags-to-riches life, a Cinderella story, the story of the ingénue who evolves from playing bit parts (and double to Norma Shearer at the very start of her career) to become one of the most powerful screen presences of last century regardless of the material offered to her. Suffice it be to say that her beginnings were humble. That she never met her father until much later in life. That eventually she became estranged from her brother Hal LeSueur. That despite every possible obstacle thrown upon her from feeling like an outsider amongst Hollywood royalty to pressure from MGM who pushed her out into the cold, she managed to stay in the game long after many top stars and ""rivals"" Greta Garbo and the aforementioned Shearer had passed on into early retirement by moving to Warners and assuring her resurgence as an actress and a well-deserved Oscar for MILDRED PIERCE. I find that the document in itself reveals quite a lot about Joan the person and from here on, Joan the Movie Star and Overall Big-Screen Persona. The comments from her co-stars and former directors are interestingly helpful in establishing how she faced acting in general while vary from pure praise (Cliff Robertson) to initial indifference turning into an apparent, reluctant admiration (Anita Louise), to open support (Diane Baker) when she was much older and alienated in a world/time which was much different than her early years in Hollywood. Everyone conceded that she brought something ""intangible"" to the table, an untouchable essence, even in her later years when it was clear that her career was long over and she was accepting parts in films like STRAIT-JACKET, I SAW WHAT YOU DID, BERSERK, and TROG. Co-workers from these films admit she played her parts as if she was still working on MILDRED PIERCE -- essentially saying she still had that which was considered ""It;"" the ability to transcend the mediocre (or at least, less than stellar) material. A shame Hollywood of the 60s stopped calling, but such were the times; while today many actresses keep busy, it's notable that these actresses start accepting smaller and smaller parts (one only has to see Anne Bancroft's career once the 90s came around: hardly a co-starring role in sight, all guest appearances, or the ""small but pivotal role"".). Joan, on the other hand, wouldn't have less than the title role, and sadly, parts aren't written with older women in mind.Now, I can't judge what transpired between her and Christina, but I noticed Christina seemed all too eager to bring forth the darker side of Joan -- how she forced the children to do the cleaning, the wire hanger incident, taking over her role in ""The Secret Storm"" and all I sense from Christina is an incessant need to repeat to the public how nasty Crawford was. The damage has been done already with the book and MOMMIE DEAREST, isn't it time to move on? Wouldn't it have been best to talk about all this while she was still alive? It's the only headache in the entire documentary.This one stumbling stone aside, JOAN CRAWFORD, THE ULTIMATE MOVIE STAR reveals a person who simply put, needed people, needed acceptance, and couldn't understand a life of quiet retirement. And while the sordid details of any actor/actress is public fodder, I find it better to focus on an objective source of information and put aside the sensationalism, and thankfully, this documentary is what MOMMIE DEAREST should have been and could not come at a better time, if it's twenty years too late, but late is better than never. It may not restore her name completely -- too much damage has been done and the scavenging of the monster MOMMIE DEAREST created has been lampooned to the death, most recently in Tyler Perry's DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN -- but at least it brings facts, not lurid details, to the forefront.

(Lady Bird was superb in my opinion - next up is Barbie, written by Noah Baumbach and starring Margot Robbie - that should be interesting.)What interested me structurally about the movie is that it is essentially both an autobiography and a fiction - the novel itself is represented as little stories but the narrative describes how the book came about. For some critics this has been problematic as it requires (or allows if you prefer) a considerable amount of time-switching, that is not always captioned for the hard of intelligence.The movie is an emotional rollercoaster with peaks of hilarity and depths of real pity as the four March sisters, that make up the main protagonists, live a struggling middle class life surrounded in close proximity by deep poverty and significant wealth. It is this relationship with money, and the pursuit thereof, that is the central philosophical backbone of the movie and allows for many excellent vignettes and clear messaging that money is not the root of all happiness.On the side of the rich sit three excellent portrayals; Timothy Chalomet (outstanding as the main love interest Laurie), his wonderful and generous of spirit grandfather (played beautifully and touchingly by Chris Cooper) and the 'evil'(ish) rich Aunt March (Meryl Streep). Laura Dern continues her annus mirabilis as the girls' mother (it complements her performance in Marriage Story.)More than once the beautiful tableaux' that Gerwig sets up reminded me of Dorothea Langue's Migrant Mother. In that it resonates love and tenderness in the face of adversity.This is a tremendous piece of film making in every way. It's funny, moving, beautiful to look at, poignant and thought provoking.Saoirse Ronan is excellent, as always, but Florence Pugh's ability to appear both 14 and 26 is even more remarkable. Emma Watson is solid and poor little Beth is played touchingly by Eliza Scanlen.Overall it's a great ensemble production with the real star of the show, Great Gerwig.Bravo!",367,0,,0,No reference

It has an excellent pace, an excellent and rather unique fish out of water experience I was hoping was going to play out throughout the episode. Instead we get yet another ""Voyager does something good only to get punished for it later"" episode. A series that seems to be endless with this show.A lot of time is spent on the energy and excitement of Torres trying to fix the machine and coming to a rather radical solution like a student with their thesis project. She solves the puzzle, the robot is fully functional and now they get to learn from the machine about who it is why it was in space.It all starts interestingly until we see the robots are not what they appear to be, they kidnap Torres because she can build and repair them. Reminds me of the TNG episode Samaritan Snare.this is where discovery ends for this episode and we are thrust back into the same idea Voyager has been exploring now for a while, war, war war. Everything seems to be about war with Voyager when in the end, it could be more about exploration like TNG. Voyager cannot seem to write an episode where Voyager gains something along the way. Instead they are always dealt a blow that makes you wonder why they continue to make the same mistakes over and over again. Janeway is definitely a person who gives the benefit of the doubt.In the end, this is a shallow episode with shallow writing. Frakes is a competent director here but the material to work with is trite. It poses nothing interesting of discussion, nothing interesting is learned other than for Voyager to never rescue more things in space. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.How could it have been fixed?First change the costume as they reminded me of the movie Sleeper and I really couldn't take them seriously. Moreso, rewrite this robot like Asimov would by making it a robot that evolved. That is, this robot gained consciousness, it feels alone, afraid, and it is praying to a God. We learn from this robot as it explores the ship and what a wonderful time for us to see the ship from this perspective. The ending could be a ship looking for it where the Robot refuses to return, kinda like Short Circuit.

This is KIND OF like crossing from hardcore to softcore porn, but Japanese AV as I understand it is real sex with the penetration ""optically fogged"" out so it perhaps doesn't quite have the stigma American XXX porn. And Japanese ""pink"" films are actually much better made films than American softcore (especially modern-day softcore). Sola has actually moved closer and closer to mainstream with recent films such as ""Man, Woman, and a Wall"". It certainly helps that she's got the most incredible body you're ever likely to see (and if it's not all-natural I want give her plastic surgeon a big hug in gratitude), but she is also a genuinely talented actress (especially, considering her AV origins). She could probably even get away with keeping her clothes on for an entire movie--but where's the fun in that? If you, uh, suffer from a Japanese schoolgirl uniform fetish, I would definitely recommend this since Sola plays easily the sexiest looking high school girl in the history of secondary education (it probably helps that she was about 20 at the time and had had A LOT of practice being sexy from her earlier AV career). The plot is not much to speak of--Sola's errant, sexually curious high school girl seduces a classmate and her male teacher (I understand the Japanese title literally translates to ""School Uniform Beauty: Shag Me, Teacher""). It's not nearly as good as her more widely available films like ""Man, Woman, and Wall"" and ""Raw Summer"", but it's good clean fun compared to some of her other, rather disturbing, early work like ""The STB Campaign"".If you DON'T currently have a Japanese schoolgirl uniform fetish, you certainly will after seeing Sola in (and out) of hers.

594,3190133,2016-12-03,rmax304823,Southpaw (2015),5.0,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Forrest Whitaker are up to par in this knock-kneed drama about pugilism. Whitaker always brings a little something extra to each role, rarely menacing, rarely perceptive, but always listening carefully. Gyllenhaal, as has become traditional, is bloodied in the boxing ring. He has three things going for him as the movie opens. He can take all kinds of punches without falling down. (Watch De Niro do the same in HIS boxing movie.) He's motivated by anger. And he loves his family, the cute Rachel McAdams who isn't around long enough, and his devoted daughter. He's so good, he's the champion. Of course his face is all misshapen and his wife wants him to quit the ring but he's pretty uneducated (he can't spell ""incarcerated"") and it's all he knows how to do. His speech is already slurred.At a party he meets the rising young star, Miguel Gomez, who is a very savvy and skilled fighter. Gomez flings a few ritual insults at Gyllenhaal's wife and daughter and the champ, being what he is, loses it. A fracas breaks out. Someone produces a pistol and McAdams is shot dead. As a result Gyllenhaal goes on a self-destructive binge and loses everything -- his house, his little daughter, his self respect, the esteem of the public, and the championship. He's now a bum living alone in a shabby hotel room.Of course we've been here before -- the sports hero battling his inner demons. And here, as elsewhere, and as my TV Guide puts it, he seeks redemption. I wish that word would disappear from our vocabulary because it's so overused. Listen, I had to learn about ""redemption"" in Catechism and redemption is when you do some terrible wrong and then make up for it by becoming sort of spiritual and by doing good works. ""Redemption"" does not mean ""success regained."" It's closer to what Freud called ""undoing."" The only person Gyllenhaal abuses is Gyllenhaal.That reminds me of my own career in the ring. In boot camp, they had try-outs for the boxing team. I knew nothing about boxing but my good friend Andy from Michigan accompanied me to the gym. He and I were outfitted with gloves the size of throw pillows and told to get in the ring and fool around. Well, Andy and I were buddies and didn't want to hit one another so we danced about and finally, bashfully, Andry swung his glove around in a long, slow loop large enough to trace the equator. I saw it coming and watched it curiously as it approached. It barely touched flesh and I was on my knees. End of ring career. Where was I? Yes. Well, now a desperate bum, Gyllenhaal finds an amateur trainer, Whittaker, and works his way up from cleaning the toilets to challenging Miguel Gomez for the championship. I will let you guess who wins. The scenes in the boxing ring are well done. When a guy misses, he misses fast, and only by half an inch, not by a mile. And the fighters actually seem to tag one another realistically. Whap -- a jab and the opponent's face is visibly knocked back.That's about the end of the good parts. Antoine Fuqua directed and he seems not to know when to leave well enough alone, or else he's aiming for an audience of semi-moronic Neanderthals who can't tell that Gyllenhaal is being crushed while he cradles his bloody and dying wife in his arms. The scene is full of blubbering and cries and lasts about as long as the Mousterian Age. It's not just the direction. There is no evident motive for his daughter's alienation. I suppose she blames her Dad for her mother's death but it seems hard to understand why she should, since Dad had practically nothing to do with the shooting. (Impressive performance here by Naomie Harris as the Child Care Worker charged with the daughter's welfare.) Whittaker teaches Gyllenhaal to fight as a Southpaw but nothing at all comes of it. The final bout is touted as ""a revenge match"" -- repeated over and over. But revenge for what? Miguel, Gyllenhaal's opponent, had nothing to do with the killing, and neither did Gyllenhaal himself.One wonder if it's at all possible to make a sports movie WITHOUT the hero falling from grace and finally ""finding redemption."" ""Rocky"" -- the first ""Rocky,"" not the egregious sequels -- was a good film about boxing and character and it ended realistically in a draw. This one is crowded with clichés and, what the hell, if the hero wants to find redemption let him join a monastery.",773,0,,0,No reference

Watching people do stupid things was hard to watch. But hey others where great. The Scott Baio drunk driving episode with the sad injury at the end with Scott diving high school match was memorable. The episode with the spoiled kid in the inner city lock up who gets stabbed over a chair episode shows how high school stupidly can cause normal life to a tragic at light speed was burned into my mind The most memorable episode was the high schooler who starting to hang out with the wrong crowd. A good kid who started with making a friend who hung out with the wrong crowed the first bad choice. Not a big problem but then starts which got the teenager into drinking, and then drugs; Another bad choice! Then stealing his dad's whiskey bottle to fit in, just getting gradually worse life choices. The teenager could of stopped here, and listen to his dad and caring family and just be a bad spot in the boys life. Regrettable, the teenager rebuked his fathers advice and caved into peer pressure! The drugs cause and effect for need of cash created a moment where the hard core friend asked if the teenager was cool meaning is he up for bad things and the guy said yeah and I just yelled to the kid on T V don't do it. The choice was his to walk away. In the end, a robbery did not work out, and the Teenager yelled dad help me behind bars as the Father says sorry it's out of my hands. These episode hit me hard.

It won the Oscar in the year of ""Citizen Kane"" (1941, Oscar Welles), and since then the aura of the ""unjustified"" Oscar sticks to the film.It may be true that ""How green was my valley"" was not the best film of 1941, that is not to say that the film is bad. Right in the opening there is a marvelous sequence. The film is told as one great flashback. As main character Huw Morgan (Roddy McDowall) starts to tell his story he is 60 years old en lives in a filthy brown Welsh coal mining town. As soon as he speaks the words ""In those days"" we return to his childhood and the landscape grows more friendly with the green colors from the filmtitle.""How green was my valley"" is an epos about the Morgan family in a Welsh coal mining village. It has characters with beautiful Welsh names in it, such as daughter Angharad (Maureen O'Hara) and daughter in law Bronwyn (Anna Lee). The Morgan family is a very traditional family with respect to male-female division of roles and the respect childrens ought to have for their parents. It is also an ideal family because the father (Donald Crisp) and the mother (Sara Allgood) are respectively a patriarch and a matriarch in the best sense of this word.Because of the character of the Morgan family, ""How green was my valley"" is a very conservative film too. Sometimes it is on the edge of melodrama, such as in the scene were the local choir has been selected to sing for the queen (a sideline which has nothing to do with the main stream of the story). John Ford is mostly known as a Western director, and the Western is an inherent conservative genre. Maybe this conservatism strikes more when it emerges in a non Western movie.By the way John Forrd may be known as a Western director, he earned his Oscars mainly with non Western movies, such as ""The informer"" (1935), The grapes of wrath"" (1940), ""How green was my valley"" (1941) and ""The quiet man"" (1952). From his Westerns only ""Stagecoach"" (1939) got nominated (but did not win).All in all, ""How green was my valley"" is a good craftfull piece of work. The cast is good but the best acting does not come from the stars (Maureen O'Hara as daughter Angharad and Walter Pidgeon as cleric Mr Gruffydd) but from Donald Crisp as father Morgan, Sara Allgood as mother Morgan and Roddy McDowall as the little Huw, from whoms point of view the story is told.",444,0,,0,No reference
605,1773404,2009-03-03,gary-444,The International (I) (2009),6.0,"A contemporary thriller featuring a corrupt bank, and the execution of banking officials, certainly scores on topicality. Overall, this attempt to deal with international terrorism, money laundering, fraud and geo-political power plays is quite enjoyable. One of the problems with financial misdeeds is that on screen, it is boring, and lacks dramatic impact. Director Tom Tykwer overcomes this by having people executed at regular intervals, and mixing it with the odd shoot out to pump up the action quotient.

Lead actor Clive Owen as international agent Louis Salinger is a serviceable enough action hero, Naomi Watts as his boss Eleanor Whitman though is totally miscast and lightweight. To his credit , Tykwer keeps the two hour running time ticking along, the drawback is that it is by a series of clichés and formulaic plot devices. You are never kept guessing as the plot unfolds.

Bank raids are exciting. Corporate plots to indebt third world country's are not. However a big budget allows the action to shuttle between Berlin, Luxembourg, Italy, New York and Istanbul, pretty much evenly divided enabling a scenic shift alone to create some new interest. But for every bit of cerebral intrigue, we are ""rewarded"" with routine action fare. Watts is run over, which hurts, but seems none the worse for her ordeal. A ""Jackal style"" execution scene is handled with the sophistication that Frederick Forsyth could muster on the back of a business card, and a shoot -out in the Guggenheim Gallery in New York is so over-blown it could have been Rambo taking on all-comers in a firestorm of automatic weapon fire.

The climax is pure James Bond. And like Bond, so long as you don't pay too much attention to the detail, it does it's job pretty well without excelling either as an action movie, or densely plotted thriller.",305,0,,0,No reference

And this one delivers on both counts.From the first moment she appears on screen Dana Wynters is captivating and gives a sensitive performance as a young and very beautiful German girl trying hard to survive a horrible time in the closing weeks of WWII after losing her family members and home to the allied bombing. Through perseverance and happenstance she manages to emerge intact and reconnect with an American soldier that she and her father had helped out once as an escaped POW.The cinematography is wonderful and authentic and shows scenes of utter devastation amidst the beauty of the German architecture, for example, the scene near the Cathedral of Cologne.My favorite scene is one where the characters were taking a boat trip down the Rhine River. The scenery is dazzling as they make way past the castles and vineyards, and especially as they pass the famous Loreleis with the sirens (actually German children) singing.Given the harsh reality of this time in history and the context, the movie avoided being particularly brutal and merely hinted at the horrors of what so many Germans went through at the end of the war. I appreciate the way this movie humanized the people of both sides.Mel Ferrer gives a solid performance as the friendly, informal American G.I. Joe. Many of the actors are European which really makes the movie better and more authentic.

Whilst this does eventually occur toward the end of the first season and dissappointed me since thats not what I went into it for (hence atleast 2 points deduction) I genuinely found the story and its characters fascinating. Dealing with the raw emotions of the families and people behind a mission like this in a world we all know could be in the future was a different level of story I honestly wasnt prepared for. I would heartily recommend this to any enthusiast of space and its exploration or stories involving it.
Its not stricly sci-fi (at least to my understanding of the genre) as much of the story is based on things that are currently happening even if a decade into the future.
However there were genuinely touching, even heart wrenching moments that, if you're into exploring the human side and struggles of those involved in making the sacrifice that inherently comes with exploring the unknown? Then this could very well be a fit for you.
My only complaint really with the series is the somewhat misdirect of the marketing and (for that other point of deduction) the sometimes slow paced nature of the story.
This however is not a reason for me to have disliked the series overall and I hope to see more.

Oh, how the blood and limbs fly! I'm not a sadistic violence-loving fan of Hostel or anything, but while watching 300 I was constantly bloodthirsty for more. More of that awesome regular-mo/slow-mo Persian ass-kicking that Gerard Butler proved to be great at. Every battle scene was a superb montage of blood and guts, interlaced with Persians falling off cliffs and Butler and company shouting chilling battle chants.300's cinematography was dazzling, although much of this was more post-production work than camera work. Nonetheless, Sparta, wilderness, and the ""Hot Gates"" are all mesmerizing to look at: think a talented artist's depiction combined with realistic CGI to create surreal dreamscapes of an epic scale.Undoubtedly, this film's selling point is its monumental action sequences, but I have to credit the acting of both Gerard Butler and Lena Headey, here, too. Butler, who I haven't really noticed before, is now at the forefront of my favorite actors. He's intense, serious, and unflinchingly awesome as King Leonidas. If I was ever to go into battle, I'd be happy to have him there. His character's wife, played by Lena Headey, was also terrific. Women tend to take the backseat in movies like this, but she played her character with strength and conviction, allowing her to shine in several of her scenes.I was drooling for most of this movie.

First let me start with the premise. Two out of their luck hitmen(?) named Longbaugh and Parker, search for that one chance at fortune. In the beginning of the film, we learn that they earn their money by means of donating uh, well, their ""fluids"" and blood. While in a sperm bank, the pair find out that a surrogate mother, Robin, of a rich couple is conducting her usual check up with her doctor. With that Longbaugh and Parker kidnap Robin and place a ransom on her.Anyways, the movie contains some of the most exciting gun-fight sequences. Sadly, that's the only positive thing I have to say about the movie. The scenes in between the flying bullets were long and boring. I felt that some of the conversations between the characters were superfluous and would be better if some of it were edited out. With a title like ""The Way of The Gun"", one would expect the movie to be high on the action meter and less on the banter. A lot of the characters were two dimensional.

Indeed, some of the coincidences that arise as the film goes on are the weakest link in this otherwise near-flawless movie.There has been much talk about the violent scenes in this movie, which are many, but especially the scenes with animals.  My view is that it is no more morally wrong to depict violence to animals than it is to depict violence to humans, as long as no animal (or human) is actually harmed in making the depiction.  We are told that none of the animals were harmed in the making of the film (and presumably also none of the people).  As far as I am concerned that is the end of that matter - the use of animals, unhamred, for this purpose is acceptable.  To argue otherwise I find, frankly, daft. However, I would recommend that people who get particularly upset when violence to animals is depicted should simply avoid this movie.Back to the movie - the acting and the cinematography are superb.  It is gripping - the film is 135 minutes long which is well past my attention span unless the film is really good.  This film is just that.",229,0,,0,No reference

Not that there is any secret to be revealed here - pretty much everything you need to know about the soulless, spirit-crushing side of movie-making is contained in Raymond Chnadler's 1945 essay ""Writer's in Hollywood"", which contains more horror than any of the celluloid parodies it has since inspired.Swimming with Sharks is the tale of innocent Guy (a freshly scrubbed Frank Whaley), whose monster boss is tinsel town king-maker Buddy Ackerman, a screaming, mood-shifting bully who dangles just enough opportunity before Guy to keep him on his leash. But payback is due, and comes in spades.It is all very dark and delicious, and Spacey gets to rip loose as the psycho boss, the joke being that it is his very lack of sanity and compassion that allows him to thrive in the business. Love interest is supplied by producer Dawn (Michelle Forbes), who allows Guy to stay grounded as he negotiates his way to the top. Dawn and Guy show us that even in Hollywood true love can conquer all - or can it? It is received wisdom that movies about movies don't travel very well. Swimming with Sharks is about delusion and corruption, and how much the human spirit can take. It just happens to be set in Hollywood, but Buddy Ackerman could be Gordon Gecko in a different market.

They might have had 100 thousand but probably less and they made a movie. A Fantasy movie and we should all be supporting Scott and Dragon no matter if we think it is bad or good. Because after several more experiences he could be making more Fantasy. And thats all we want. Yes they could have worked harder on the sword play but it looks like they were clashing with real steel metal... and on bigger budget films they clash with fiber-glass and aluminum swords so they can really hack away and hit each other. I saw the making of and thought these guys are crazy to hit steel on steel... a sword could break and impale someone or they could chop off a finger no matter if the sword was not sharpened. The Dragon was done on someone's home PC or Mac so that is pretty cool. A few more layers of texture and it would have been really good... it was better then the giant blue rooster in Eragon. The acting was good. I thought the actor with the most charisma was the big warrior... his accent was iffy at best... I think he should have just used his American accent because this is Fantasy... not Enlish history. The two warrior knights were solid British actors, I bet really good a Shakespeare. All the girls were solid especially the Magic user with the white contacts. She has a Angelina Jolie quality that really made this film watchable... please bring her back in the sequels and a reincarnated Gandalf character... who is more powerful. She is the best thing about this movie. And all her bolts of energy were really well done, just as good as the new Dungeons and Dragons movie. A few simple things could have really improved this movie... change of locations... find some rocks or a cave... lots in Wisconsin. Cut dialogue in half... find a dwarf... do not clash real steele swords (only in close ups)... you are going to kill somebody and it never looks right. All in all we should encourage Mr. Scott to formulate the story and bring it back for two more... come on a low budget fantasy trilogy... that's good and ambitious... spend a few thousand dollars on a really good script doctor or a professional who is really savy with dialogue (Mr. Scott and his writing partner are good with original story... while Eragon is a plot point for plot point copy of Star Wars).

628,3038465,2016-03-06,timdalton007,The Thin Red Line (1998),9.0,"When one reads or hears the term ""war movie,"" it brings with a certain amount of baggage. One perhaps thinks of the British war films of the 1940s and 1950s with stiff upper lips or Hollywood epics such as The Longest Day or Patton or Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Then you get a film that has the apparent look of the genre but is something quite different when viewed closer. The Thin Red Line, Terrence Mallick's 1998 film based on James Jones' 1962 novel set during the US Guadalcanal Campaign against the Japanese during World War II, is just such a film.For one thing, this film is without many of the pretentious things war film clichés and tropes. There's no big speeches about patriotism or glory or the righteousness of the cause being fought for. Not a single one of the characters presented here likely cares or thinks about that. These are ordinary men in extraordinary situations, some in the Army before the war started, others caught up in events that see there fates bringing them to this small Pacific island. As a result, their reactions to the battle are many and varied. They range from bravery to boisterous, brutality to thoughtfulness and a whole sweep of emotions in-between. The choice of voiceovers is intriguing, giving word to the emotions and thought processes taking place in the minds and behind the eyes of many of the soldiers the viewer meets. Indeed much of the film is based on those emotions rather than huge, sweeping battle sequences which is something that is likely to upset some viewers. Yet it may be for the film's betterment.For it's brought to life by a series of strong performances. The film's cast is massive including both name actors in small roles and then unknowns who've gone on to greater fame is some cases all playing soldiers of varying ranks caught up in the incredible campaign. It's hard to argue that the film has any central character though both Jim Caviezel as the thoughtful Private Witt and Sean Penn's pragmatic bordering on cynical Sergeant Welsh come closest to that with their very different reactions to the events taking place around them. The film's massive cast includes Elias Koteas, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson with cameos by Miranda Otto, John Travolta and George Clooney as well. The combination of on screen performances and voice overs present one of the most unique mixes of talent one is ever likely to watch.As well as its strong performances and interesting emphasis on the human cost of war, the film is also a visual feast. Mallick and cinematographer John Toll set The Thin Red Line apart from many ""war films"" with lush cinematography that contrasts the beauty of the Pacific and Guadalcanal with the horror and violence of the battle being fought there. Sequences such as the film's opening and closing minutes are superb examples of this from both before and after the battle. Plus, for all of its focus on the human cost, the film's battle sequences are each superb examples of well staged and photographed chaos that celebrates not the triumph of victory but the desperation of men trying to stay alive. Backed by a haunting Hans Zimmer score that also incorporates music by John Powell, the result is powerful.At the end of the day, The Thin Red Line is an unlikely mixing of an art house flick and a big budget Hollywood war film. It is a feast for the senses with its combination of striking visuals, superbly staged chaotic battle sequences and a haunting music score. Yet it's more than a typical war film as it examines the effects of war on the men who fight it and the contrast between the beauty of the island with the horror and chaos afflicted upon it. The film remains a unique look at war from one of cinema's most unique directors.",658,0,,0,No reference

This is one such film....SHEEPDOG!From his early childhood Texan Chris Kyle has been reared to obey orders and not question. An early scene in the film sets the tone. Over dinner his father gives Chris the choice of being a wolf, sheep or sheepdog. Holding a belt in his hand (to thrash them with) his father then continues to eliminate wolves and sheep from possible career paths for Kyle and his brother.Eventually Chris joins the US SEALS as a sniper to nurture his sheepdog skills further. From here stationed the film follows him home and away as he does four tours in Iraq. The film descends into the Jingoistic one dimensional film that you thought Hollywood had stopped making. The bad guys are all on the other side. Its true Chris Kyle killed women and children but it was justified since they were ""Savages"" who did not have the right to protect their soil. The few Iraqis that did co-operate were either duplicitous or greedy for money (by the way the got what they deserved, everybody else did according to Chris Kyle's autobiography on which the film is closely based)I've been watching Bradley Cooper over 10 years now since his regular appearance in the acclaimed TV series 'Alias'. Every Big screen performance has increased his stature as an actor able to take on a variety of roles. Cooper's Portrayal of Chris Kyle here is no exception. He perfectly plays the character with the required weight (physically and emotionally). He tries to show this racist ""hero"" as a man with pent up frustration and Angst. But the character is too one dimensional. You are left with no sympathy for him. How can you when a man says he had no regrets about killing over 150 people. No all 166 bullets were perfectly justified he was happy to meet his maker when he questioned him (his words not mine).This sheepdog was just protecting his herd.At various times the film tried to turn this into a duel with an enemy sniper but this had been done already with great success by the film Enemy at the Gate with Jude Law.In reality the film was more like the Nazi sniper cinema promo in Tarantino's Inglorious B*stards.That was another film which glorified a sniper, however that was done to show the inhumanity of the audience. A testament to those who rate this film so highly now perhaps?The directing was flawless and the action sequences were taught and expertly done.Call me idealistic but when I watch a film I like to see a biopic that inspires or educates me. This simple Good v Evil line should be kept to animation or superhero genre. I like a so called true story to leave me feeling that I was somehow a better member of the human race. I thought we had seen the end of jingoistic and bigoted views of the Iraq conflict albeit glossily done after all it is over 13 years since 9/11 and even the US government admitted it tortured, detained and killed people inhumanely in an unjustified war. In this film only the other side did atrocities like that..so says the sheepdog.Mr Eastwood you are a veteran cinema actor/director. You can pick and choose any project. I expect better from you. Please use your skills wisely and leave the legacy that justifies the Giant of cinema that you are.This US Army promo will receive awards and acclaim but hey it just illustrates everything that's wrong with the world!",601,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

Despite presence of Powell, he's given no chance to demonstrate his special personality skills-- that would come later with Nick and Nora Charles. Too bad, because the narrative could use more character color, aside from a droll Palette as police inspector. As a murder mystery, the film's nothing special. There's the old brain-teaser of murder in a locked room, but that's cleared up too soon. Too bad the collection of suspects are all men with only two women in the cast. Then too, headliner Mary Astor gets little screen time and is largely wasted. From that gender standpoint, the movie remains something of an oddity. Nonetheless, the storyline is smoothly directed by the canny Mike Curtiz. At the same time, I like the use of flashbacks to clear up the convoluted murders, which otherwise are pretty much beyond viewer solution. Anyway, it's good to know that Powell would soon take Asta and go on to the Thin Man series, which is more entertaining than this mediocre effort.",172,0,,0,No reference
632,77130,1999-07-07,gortx,Gonks Go Beat (1964),,"Incredibly rare, mid-60's rock and roll sci-fi obscurity. So rare, most film books don't even LIST the title.

A recent screening of the sole surviving print at Hollywood's AMERICAN CINEMATEQUE, shows that the film is no great shakes, but worth seeking out for the completists.

GONKS tells the story of an Alien who comes to earth to settle a dispute between the two great nations of our future planet. One nation loves rock and roll, the other, ballads. The Alien befriends a bizarre former Record Exec (MR. A & R) who looks suspiciously like Buddy Holly (had he lived to join Elvis in Vegas!). The pair hatch a scheme to set up a Romeo and Juliet-like romance to bring the warring nations together.

It works, but not before a bunch of mediocre rock songs and wretched ballads are sung, cheap interior sets are trampled and the audience's patience is worn thin. Meanwhile, on planet Gonk, a bunch of hand puppets runs amok.

The biggest highlight is a thrilling 9 Drummer jam session (led by Ginger Baker) held in a prison cell (don't ask).

635,3021210,2016-02-03,lucasnochez,Steve Jobs (2015),10.0,"It is often stated that the line between insanity and genius is measured only by success. When discussion turns to that of one's genius, we find it difficult not to equate that genius with some level of insanity. This is especially true when that discussion focuses on Steve Jobs, the man behind machines that allows us to hold the world in the palm of our hand. Steve Jobs is not simply a film, but is an experience of perception; of history; and of a household name.When evaluating Steve Jobs the film, one has to stop and admire the genius of writer Aaron Sorkin. The Academy Award winner extends the parameters of his brilliance through a film that not only allows us an understanding of a complex mind, but accurately illustrates the torments, criticisms and neglect that shaped the man entrusted with its ownership. Based on Walter Isaacson's non- fiction memoir, Sorkin's script rockets off the tongues of the film's talented cast and grabs your attention as you dance through every nuanced conflict of Jobs' life. Daringly mimicking theatre in its three-piece act structure, the film presents the events of three major launches, and three very different pictures of Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender), in real time.The first, shot in low-resolution 16mm film, set in Cupertino, California, shows a grainy and young Jobs moments before his inaugural Macintosh in 1984, days after the infamous science fiction based Apple commercial. The second, showing the recently axed Jobs, in 1988 at the historical San Francisco Opera House before his infamously disastrous NeXT cube launch in widescreen 35mm film displays a vengeful and highly orchestrated Jobs. Finally, in 1998, returning to Apple, this time as CEO, utilising high-definition digital film at San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall, before his presentation of the iMac. The last act presents to the audience the most human yet morally flawed version of a man no one ever really understood. Each scene, running close to thirty five minutes each, is as enthralling, entertaining and orchestrated as the next.Jobs has always maintained a very muddled and misguided personal life; one that includes a young daughter Lisa with a college sweetheart Christen Brennan (Katherine Waterston), very uninspiring social skills as well as a knack for being referred to as unlovable. Sorkin's script looks to answer one of the biggest questions plaguing the late great tech genius: can a great man still be a good man? Thanks to an electric script by the great Aaron Sorkin, phenomenal performances on all fronts, masterful direction and a brilliant neo-classical score by Daniel Pemberton, Steve Jobs is easily a crowning cinematic achievement and the best film of 2015, in spite of not being the most audience alluring film released this award season.From the beginning, the film is a pish-posh of gossip and rumours. Not that anyone thought the film would bow down to the atrocious Ashton Kutcher vehicle Jobs in 2013, but the film did suffer a slew of ""technical difficulties"" going into production. Once in the hands of David Fincher, the film was always setup to be as great, if not greater than The Social Network. With Christian Bale initially cast, the film went through directors, stars and crew like a Daytona racetrack, eventually settling on director Danny Boyle, and stars Michael Fassbender and Daniel Pemberton instead of a roster that may very well have included Fincher, Bale, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Luckily for audiences, Steve Jobs is not an unwanted and pumped out studio biopic, and focuses less on the look of Jobs and more on the essence of a man struggling with himself more than the struggles of an economically competitive technological world.While the film is presented in a very basic three act structure, there is nothing simple about the film. Driven by dialogue, its characters and three very crucial times in the life of Steve Jobs, the abstract delivery of these highly regarded singular events of the 20th century are presented with ease and class.In a world where recognition is everything, and being pointed out in humiliation and failure could forever change your reputation professionally, Steve Jobs, logically speaking, had no right becoming a pioneer of technology. He was no engineer, designer or programmer, yet, the world knew his name and the ramifications of his brilliance. In one of the many powerful scenes of the film, when confronted by his cohort and early friend, Apple Co-Founder Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Seth Rogen) what he does. In response, Jobs says, ""I play the orchestra!"" Often times being measured next to Leonardo Da Vinci, Julius Ceasar and God himself, Jobs was often misconceived as a diabolical man with a plan, giving out the passes to whomever came in his way.While many may be very discouraged to see the film, with fear that a biopic of a gifted tech guru would be overwhelmed with difficult tech-inspired lingo, the film is a well balanced feature showcasing moments of extreme drama, emotion and heart. Many of these scenes are anchored with Jobs by himself, the women in his life, father figure and late CEO of Apple John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) and friends. The emotions in the film hold together the very fine strains of intensity and drive the white-knuckled pace of the film overall.Holding the very intimate moments of the film are the women in Steve Jobs; an old flame Chrisann, his daughter Lisa (played by Makenzie Moss at 5, Ripley Sobo at 9, and Perla Haney-Jardine at age 19) and the only person who ever stands up to Jobs, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet). Sorkin, who has more than enough substance with his male leads, uses the women in Jobs' life to draw out the kinks in the suit of amour Jobs so easily shows us, dealing with simple issues of patriarchy, ego, and image.",967,0,,0,No reference
636,1243916,2006-07-15,charchuk,Superman (1978),8.0,"The classic superhero movie, perhaps a bit dated but still fantastic. The origin story is done superbly, building up his beginnings without rushing through it too fast. Though the scenes at Krypton go on for a bit too long, and some don't have any effect on the rest of the film (mainly the trial scene - though it relates to the sequel), the film never feels boring and the pacing is perfect. The one that all other comic book films borrow from nowadays, with the perfect blend of action, romance, and comedy. Truly a classic.Though he is only third billed, Reeve is clearly the star of the show and delivers an iconic performance. Not only is his portrayal of Superman fantastic, but his dual role as the nerdy Clark Kent is even more difficult to pull off and, yet, spot-on. With Reeve's performance, there's no wonder how the characters don't put two and two together - the two roles are very much separate. Hackman is a great Lex Luthor, with perfect comic timing and good rapport with his sidekicks. Brando pretty much sleepwalks through this one, but he still makes it work. Kidder still irritates me as Lois Lane, she's the one major problem I have with the film. Very shrill and annoying.The only flaw I see in the story is the ending - not only is Luthor's plan completely implausible (like the military wouldn't check the codes again before firing the missiles), but Superman's solution to Lois' death is a complete cop-out. If Superman can turn back time, what's to stop him from solving any problem at any time? It removes an element of realism from the film and loses the suspense. Though it was nice to see Superman get really angry, to show that he's not emotionless. Everything else leading up to climax, however, was perfect.The effects are a little dated but still work, you can still believe Superman's flying. John Williams delivers another memorable score, and it works very well with the film. There are some scenes that are far too cheesy (saving the cat out of the tree, delivering Lex to the prison at the end), but they don't feel terribly out of place. And Reeve takes the role very serious, enough to compensate. Overall, one of the best comic book films of all-time and one of the better films of the '70s. Outstanding.",398,0,,0,No reference

Jim's red jacket, Judy's red coat in the beginning, and Buzz and all his cronies where black leather coats.Dean's performance is remarkable. It is a shame he was only featured in 3 films, none the less, he is one of America's icons. He symbolizes what every guy wants to be. He is not the only good performer. Backus gives a tremendous performance as the father, the understanding, somewhat lenient parent of Jim Stark. Wood and Mineo both received Oscar nominations and both were well deserved.As mentioned earlier, these are the most confusing years for a teenager. One scene that says it perfectly is after the knife incident when Jim comes home. He walks up the stairs to find what appears to be his mother in an apron cleaning up. It turns out to be his father cleaning up the food he spilled for his wife who is a little under the weather. They both laugh and Jim tells him to leave the food so she can see it. The father doesn't understand and Jim just keeps telling him to. He gets flustered and walks away. He stutters and just can't give a straight answer to his father. This is a perfect comparison to much of Jim's life. He does something but cannot explain it.Rebel Without a Cause is a classic from the 1950's. A movie that to this day is a perfect example of how each new generation is as rebellious as the one before it.",658,0,,0,No reference
639,3106432,2016-07-07,Leofwine_draca,Half Piece of Map (1981),6.0,"I watched a film with the English title of BUDDHIST FIST & TIGER CLAWS, but I don't think it's a same film as the title which is linked on IMDb. For a start this is a contemporary crime thriller, not a fantasy, and in addition the credits are completely different on the print I saw. The direction is credited to Godfrey Ho and the producer is listed as Tomas Tang; the cast lists mainly Mandarin names. This may have been a South Korean movie or alternatively one shot in Hong Kong or Taiwan; I really have no idea. It's a pretty average film anyway, about a pair of card sharps who get involved with the mob and have to fight for survival. The main fun comes from the novelty of seeing Hwang Jang Lee in one of his rare good guy performances.

Lee turns out to be just as efficient a fighter playing the hero as he was playing the baddie, although seeing him getting beaten up so easily early on is a bit difficult to swallow. The rest of the plot is quite ordinary, with sneering master villains and the like, with physical deformity or quirk usually added to enhance the villains (in this instance one of them has a blind eye). The acting is undistinguished, but the suits certainly look expensive, and the action is fresh and fast enough to make this work.",235,0,,0,No reference

I dragged my girlfriend to it and now I'm pretty sure I have to go to see 3 chick flicks just be able to pick a movie again. I was on a role to, took her to Immortals she loved it, Avengers she also loved it. Third time Prometheus. Oops..If you take someone to Prometheus on a first date you will not be getting any sex, you will not even get a second date. This movie is so bad it made me Sign up for IMDb account just to give it a poor review. They should have just made it a separate movie but they added the last scene in so it could get the entire buzz about being a prequel and thus gain viewers like me who loved the ""Aliens 1 and 2"" growing up.Let's start with Aliens. A great movie. I wrote a paper in ""Women in Film"" class comparing Ripley to Jesus and how Ridley Scott is a genius. I've seen every alien movie over 10 times each. The first one is amazing the second one is also amazing the third is great and the four is good. So I understand Ridley Scott is running out of ideas and it is hard to write four extra movies from 1. So I assumed this would be like a crappy alien 5. Was I let down. It was awful. I agree with everyone on that its visually stunning. So it taking drugs and watching glow sticks but its Not really what makes a movie. PLOT makes a movie. When you want to create suspense you first build the characters then have terrible things happen to them. With Sci Fi you can do things that are unbelievable, but the way the characters act still needs to be real. I had no attachment to anyone on the ship. They all could die I wouldn't of cared. I feel like Ridley Scott is like a rock star of directors, but even rock stars make shitty Christmas albums. He's old and out of touch with what movie need. They could have gotten rid of all the special effects and told a better story I would have been happy. I feel like no matter what this movie was going to make him money so he didn't care. I bet it's that asshole from lost a show I never watched and am glad. He shouldn't have surrounded himself with such poor writers he was doomed from the start. Ahh WTF So you are telling me Aliens were created by a robot who poisons a man who has sex with a infantile woman who then gets an alien aborted squid removed from her abdomen which grows into a larger face sucker which deep throats a humanoid alien and poof the first alien is born? ah!! Everyone knows you start humanoid alien spaceships with a flute solo?? The only thing they did right was the marketing, I REALLY wanted to see it, AND I see about 4 movies a year. One more thing was right the name Prometheus stole fire; this took the fire from Ridley's Career.

642,2660149,2014-05-11,howard.schumann,Heaven Is for Real (2014),8.0,"Most parents as well as many psychologists, educators, and religious leaders assume that children are not able to be ""spiritual,"" and their experiences are dismissed as fantasy, hallucination, or pathology. Randall Wallace's Heaven is for Real, however, asks us to keep an open mind and listen to our children. Based on the bestselling book by Todd Burpo and Lynn Vincent and adapted for the screen by Wallace and Chris Parker, the film dramatizes the near-death experience of then four-year-old Colton (Conner Corum) during surgery for a ruptured appendix as told to his father Todd (Greg Kinnear), a local pastor and volunteer fireman in rural Nebraska.

According to young Colton, during his surgery he could look down and see his body on the operating table, see his father venting his anger at God in an adjacent room and his mother Sonja (Kelly Reilly) talking on the phone. He talks about a vision he had of a place of light and beauty that he called ""heaven,"" reflecting his Christian upbringing. Colton also describes a vision of Jesus riding on a multi-colored horse, sitting on Jesus' lap, and listening to angels singing to him. More surprisingly, Colton says that he met his grandfather whom he identified from an old picture and a second sister who died in a miscarriage many years ago even though he had never been told about her.

Todd, who had a rough year, fracturing his leg playing baseball, enduring a bout of kidney stones, and struggling to make ends meet financially, is uncertain how to deal with his son's story and the family's reaction captures the fear and confusion that many adults have when children know or see more than we think they should. While first dismissing it as a child's vivid imagination, the details that emerge of Colton's visits with deceased family members cause him to rethink his easy dismissal. With no map for understanding these experiences, church members also feel uneasy, especially Nancy (Margo Martindale) who is bitter that that her son was taken while Todd's was spared.

Todd also has to endure ridicule from friends while young daughter Cassie (Lane Styles) is forced to physically defend her brother from unthinking taunts by schoolmates. Even Todd's best friend Jay (Thomas Haden Church), a banker and church board member, begins to pull away and Todd's position as pastor appears in jeopardy. Beset by doubts, he begins to question his own faith. Though he loves his son unconditionally and believes he is telling the truth, he cannot explain how the boy's experience fits in with his biblical teachings. Unfamiliar with children's near-death experiences, he does some research on the Internet and visits a psychology professor at the university (Nancy Sorel), but she offers little insight.

While Heaven is for Real can be moving and strives to maintain a balance, it is too simplistic in its depiction of a powerful and mysterious experience as just another feel-good story that reinforces Christian beliefs. The film also does not tell us that what people see in their near-death experiences depends on their own psychology, personal experiences, and cultural and religious upbringing. As Todd, Kinnear brings intelligence and sensitivity to his role and bolsters a story that could have become heavy-handed. Similarly, Corum is very convincing and rarely awkward as the little boy with the unusual story.

While it is definitely told from a Christian point of view, to its credit, the film's focus is less on religion than on the effect of Colton's NDE on the community and the bond between father and son. Even if you do not believe that Colton's epiphany provides a glimpse of what may await us in the afterlife, it is wise to reflect on the words of Albert Einstein who said, ""The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed."" If the film accomplishes nothing more than having people pause to wonder, it will have achieved its purpose.",693,0,,0,No reference

646,1025869,2005-09-04,Whythorne,The Preacher's Wife (1996),3.0,"Yet another cinematic remake of an older classic that begs the question: ""Why?"" Especially when the changes made to script and story not only offer no improvement, but are actually giant steps backward.""The Bishop's Wife,"" upon which this film is based, beats this one hands down in all major categories of story, direction, and acting. I even enjoyed the original soundtrack by Hugo Friedhofer far better, in spite of the fact that this film was obviously intended to be a vehicle to exploit Whitney Houston's vocal talent. (Does that remind you of another Whitney Houston vehicle co-starring Kevin Costner?)In the original movie, a need for an angel to be sent to the Bishop makes perfect sense...the bishop played by David Niven was obviously conflicted with earthly ambitions and had lost his way spiritually, sadly neglecting his wife and child in the process. In this remake, Denzel as Dudley the angel seems lost as to what his mission is. In fact, the Preacher often seems to be a better person than the angel in this version! The basic problem is that the Preacher is so dedicated in his role as pastor helping the sick and troubled ghetto kids, his time as a family man is understandably stretched thin. (Incidentally, there is a scene where Henry the preacher is spending quality time with his son, which even undercuts the film's attempt to construct this minor conflict.) Anyway, it all seems more like a job for a scheduling consultant than something as drastic as sending an angel down from heaven to perform ""miracles"".The Bishop's Wife was also made during a time when Hollywood did not shy away from Christian spiritual themes. While Cary Grant's Dudley the angel is clearly a messenger and servant of God, Denzel Washington's tired glances skyward seem to indicate a reluctant impatience with the Almighty that further contradicts his role and ultimate purpose in the story. And as can be expected in this era of movie sermonizing, humanism is the true ""savior"" celebrated on Christmas Day.A handsome cast with Denzel and Whitney, but lacking all the charm, subtle spiritual depth and cohesion of the original.",356,0,,0,No reference

649,248350,2001-01-24,moonspinner55,Audrey Rose (1977),6.0,"Overlong, pointless reincarnation-thriller takes its cue from ""The Exorcist"" in that it places a young girl in traumatic, metaphysical circumstances. Anthony Hopkins is well-cast as a mysterious man mourning the death of his little girl Audrey Rose, who perished in a car accident many years ago. He enters the lives of a New York City couple, claiming the soul of their preteen daughter Ivy once belonged to his child (he may be right, but what does he want done about it?). Hopkins is terrific in the film's early scenes, but eventually his speeches about reincarnation and the eternal struggle of souls become tiresome. As the girl's parents, Marsha Mason and John Beck are an unlikely couple; Mason's character (usually on the verge on tears) makes no sense, while vapid Beck is obviously out of his league alongside such acting heavyweights (occasionally twitching his model's mustache, so thick and perfect I expected someone to rip it off him). As the hapless Ivy, Susan Swift screams and cries convincingly enough, and I liked her hypnosis scene at the end, but she's an untrained child-actor with a limited range. Worst of all is a laughable courtroom sequence wherein a handicapped woman is wheeled in to tell her story and goes into such precise and incredible detail about a car wreck that ""Audrey Rose"" for a moment becomes a self-parody. Director Robert Wise, who interjects footage of natives and their reincarnation rituals into the mix, hasn't the visual style for this kind of material. The film has a dull, square look. There is a striking sequence involving a bonfire, and the well-mounted finale is nicely-done, but Wise is discreet in the worst way. He tiptoes around the plot-holes in the screenplay as if acknowledging them would be too rude. That doesn't make him a smart filmmaker--just one who is out-of-touch. **1/2 from ****",309,0,,0,No reference

The program - originally produced on HBO - has a strong cast of celebrity interviewees including Whoopi Goldberg, Hillary Roddam Clinton, Tina Brown, and Yoko Ono. The overall impression, however, is a mixed one: while Leibowitz is an undoubtedly talented artist, with a unique ability to capture images on film, it seems that she has become more concerned with photographing celebrities, rather than recording life around her. It seems that contemporary cultures are more preoccupied with worlds of surface that obfuscate rather than explore the truth.

The bad guys, and in 1941 the bad guys had no redeeming character traits, decided to rob a train because it would be carrying an unusually valuable shipment in its baggage car. They needed more time than would be allotted if they merely stopped the train to perform the dastardly deed.What most people in the movie had forgotten about was a railroad siding that lead into a long since abandoned dead-ended tunnel. I do remember at the time that there was a logical reason for the tunnel's existence -- but 67 years! Give me a break, I don't remember what it was. Now the reason most people had forgotten about the railroad siding was that not only was the tunnel no longer of purpose but also the tracks leading into the tunnel were covered with a thin layer of sand that had simply blown over the tracks. So the bad guys stop the train and have it backed into the tunnel, the weight of the passenger cars and engine being enough to keep it on the tracks; tracks covered with that thin covering of sand. The train was backed into the tunnel and the tunnel entrance blasted shut. The wind quickly blew more sand over the tracks hiding all evidence of a train having passed over them and into the tunnel.Then the clever part; further up the tracks at a railroad crossing the villains set up a system of loud speakers and loudly played the sounds of the train passing by right on time at the very early AM. They telephoned a conductor living in the town, waking him so that he could hear the train go by. The train never arrived at it's destination.Now in 1941 at 13 years old I didn't much care about Arthur Conan Doyle. I just vividly remember parts of the film and hope that some day it becomes available on DVD.

They're both set in girls' boarding schools and involve similar situations with female bonding and sadistic teachers, but there the similarities end. While watching MEMENTO MORI, it soon becomes apparent that this is an extremely atypical horror film: it's more of a touching, tragic love story between two lesbian school friends rather than anything else. It turns out that the director had no desire to make a ghost story featuring any of the traditional ghostly stuff from Asia, but the producers forced him to add some ethereal menace to appeal to the ready fan base.

I found the film to be one of two halves. The first forty-five minutes is stodgy, dull and slow: it's a depiction of school life full of interchangeable characters and unappealing sequences. I found little to keep me watching, but persevered nonetheless and was rewarded by an improved second half, which actually features intriguing plotting and some intelligent, well-filmed moments. The ghostly stuff is kept to a minimum other than in a few situations, and it works better that way. It's not a film which I can actively describe because doing so will spoil it; but if you're looking for an unusual take on a usually familiar genre then this might be up your street.",235,0,,0,No reference
657,5248043,2020-09-15,silaspanfil,Cuties (2020),8.0,"This movie at its core is about the performative expectations of young women in modern society and the conflict those expectations can cause.
The main character, Amy, is raised in a traditional Senegalese household and is taught that the exposed female form is to be derided and shamed. On the flip-side she is also a child in the late-2010's bombarded with the expectations of social media, and modern culture at large that prizes raw sexuality and fetishizes youth.Through the course of the film Amy finds that no matter which side she attempts to please or conform to, she finds herself fundamentally unhappy and both cultures, traditional and modern, find her lacking the necessary grace to be accepted.This film discusses the real world struggles for identity and acceptance that many girls deal with on a day-to-day basis, and highlights the stark contrast between the modern performative expectations of sexuality and a girl coming to own her sexuality in a healthy constructive way. Similarly, we see how even when cloistered from ""modern society"" in a Senegalese closed-community the expectations of sexual ownership and femininity are similarly fraught. This is displayed most prominently as Amy's mother finds her husband has taken a second wife without her approval and she (Amy's mother) is expected to carry this burden with grace and without protest.As for as the over-sexualization of the child performers is concerned, I can agree that some of the filmography lingers unnecessarily. I believe a greater distance from the performers would have given the audience a better perspective on what our culture expects (See: Tiktok, Instagram) versus the youth of the performers themselves. The film does not glorify the over-sexualized actions, it condemns them. The film never encourages you to ""enjoy"" these scenes, but to be made uncomfortable for good reason. Young girls should not have societal pressure to be ""performatively sexual enough"" for society. They deserve to come to explore and own their sexuality for themselves and themselves only.This is a nuanced film that deserves a nuanced viewing, and yes, a viewing. If you have not watched this movie in whole you should not be speaking on it. You are speaking from a position of chosen ignorance and even if your feelings about the film don't change after you have seen it, at least you have watched the source material whole-cloth.This is a story about individuality and shrugging off the mantle of societal expectation both modern and traditional.This is a very well told story and I give this movie an 8/10.",419,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

The only thing it doesn't have is some gratuitous nudity and, frankly, this movie is good enough that it doesn't need it.Steve and Patrick (Kerr Smith and Lochlyn Munro) are a couple of med students driving through the back roads of Oregon. Steve's an uptight grinder who tries to keep everything under control. Patrick is the life of the party who skates through life with a smile on his face. They pull into a roadside bar which just happens to be hosting a college cheerleader convention. Patrick thinks he's in heaven, but Steve just wants to get back to his med student girlfriend Sara (Michelle Harrison). Patrick talks him into staying for one beer and while his buddy cavorts, Steve is propositioned by the ""bar hot"" Amber (Angela Featherstone).Against his better judgment, Steve follows her out into the parking lot but stops himself before it goes to far. Then Amber's fat faced boyfriend Bo (Adrien Dorval) whacks Steve in the head with a 2x4. They've made a little business out of mugging travelers like Steve and Bo drags him into the woods to have some fun. He pulls out a gun and starts shooting around Steve, until Bo accidentally shoots himself. Steve thinks he's been saved. Then Bo turns out to be a local deputy and calls for back up, claiming Steve shot him. That sends Steve and Patrick on the run, pursued by the county sheriff (Donnelly Rhodes) who happens to be Bo's father. As the carnage and death toll mounts, the FBI become involved and the media get hold of Steve's story, which brings Sara up to Oregon to see what she can do. As Steve and Patrick find themselves deeper and deeper in trouble, they have to go to greater and greater extremes to stay alive.Pressure is a fine example of how important plot is to making a successful melodrama. This isn't a production about subtle characterization or thematic depth. It's about the characters moving from crisis to crisis and barely managing to crawl out the other side. A story like this needs two things above all else. One is speed, and this film moves along at a crackerjack pace. There are not only no wasted scenes, there are hardly any wasted seconds. You can't overestimate the value of constant forward movement in this sort of movie.The second necessary thing is to have more than one thing going on. Melodramas are looked at as simpler and shallower than serious drama, but they do need a certain amount of narrative complexity to work well. They need to have multiple conflicts spread out amongst multiple characters, moving both in parallel and converging. Pressure, for example, does not just focus on Steve and Patrick's scramble to survive. It also has a subplot on the abusive relationship of Bo and Amber. He's a seething boil of resentment and insecurity who takes it all out on her and the pressure that builds up on Amber mirrors the tension that Steve is going through. And then there's a tertiary conflict between the sheriff and the FBI over who's going to catch Steve and additional levels of interpersonal strife between Patrick and Steve over who got them into this mess, Steve and Sara over what he did or didn't do with Amber and even Bo and his father.Those two characters and the men who play them are the real stars of this film. Bo is such a contemptible, stupid bully that after he gets shot in the dick once, you dislike him so much you want to see him get shot in the dick again. Adrien Dorval does a great job embodying just about every negative thing about overgrown boys who think they're men. Bo's father, on the other hand, is definitely a man. A blocky union of intensity and deliberation, the sheriff is able to hold life and death in his hands with equanimity. Donnelly Rhodes forcefully portrays one of the most imposing challenges any melodrama hero has ever run up against.Now, the last 20 minutes of Pressure is a bit too dependent on the sheriff getting far too kill crazy to be realistic and the film does seem to think it gave Steve more of a character arc than it actually did, but those are minor flaws.In the barren wasteland of low budget cinema, Pressure is an oasis of entertainment.

To my complete and utter surprise, I loved it.Let me just be real clear. I loathe Disney. Loathe it. It's history and iconography do nothing for me, save perhaps make me a bit queasy. It's not that I'm some artsy-fartsy, highfalutin type either. Disney just doesn't agree with me. But despite a lot of Disney trappings, I thought AatTHNGVBD was an energetic and genuinely funny little movie that left me not queasy, but with a bit of a sugar buzz. I don't know that there's a genuine moment in the entire thing, but it plays its tune more skillfully than most Disney fare.",156,0,,0,No reference

We have been waiting long time to see Bonnet get what he deserved so I don't mind that he is gone. Sure he was a great villain but I do agree that it was his time to go. I wouldn't want to see him trying to get his son through the courts. I also don't mind that he kidnapped Brianna. It was clear that he had some sort of feelings for her once she visited him in jail. I just think they took it too far. Once he took her she had to give her family time to find her so it was smart to go along with whatever he wanted but she should have shown him that she is more scared of him. Making him feel that if he treats her better then there might be a chance for them. Bonnet is not stupid and it's hard for me to believe he believed her until the kiss. No way he would buy that she wants to go back home to bring their son back to him. It was done alright but it could have been done much better.As to his capture and execution, no way Roger would be able to knock him down without a fight! Jamie, sure but not Roger. I also wanted to see Jamie punch him and take his revenge. Jamie should have captured him and then Roger could have beaten him up but Roger on his own, no way. I'm also not really happy that Brianna decided to give him to the authorities. Giving him another chance to escape was absolutely the wrong thing to do! I also not sure I believe the government would have helpEd them after the way Jamie and he ended things. As for the execution itself, drowning him was a good idea because he told Bree he was afraid of the ocean (although he wasn't in the ocean but still). I just wish she hadn't shot him. He escaped the scariest part of all, the second the water get so high up that he can feel the end. I think she did it out of mercy and sorry but I really don't like it. He robbed and killed and raped and mutilated people and was not even sorry for a minute. Once he decided he doesn't believe her (after the kiss) he was willing to sell the mother of his child like a piece of garbage. He didn't deserve mercies! And we should have seen Jamie take his revenge. As much as I dislike Roger, he was right that Brianna is his wife and he should be the on to kill him (or Bree if she wanted to) but Jamie (the main and most important character) should have at least be the one who caught him and made him hurt.With some small changes this episode could have easily been a 10/10.",522,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

So the film holds to an ideal of equality that most of its characters would not have been able to feel? Why should I care - I'm not from their century, so don't feel the need to be constrained by their sensibilities.
I liked the idea and was mostly taken by the acting and the fight scenes. Especially the fight scenes. Someone else said that this looked like people trying to kill each other and not just high five swords and I can't agree more. Very realistic looking fights.
I especially loved seeing Vladimir Kulich in this. He has a real presence and just makes anything he's in better. That said, so did nearly all of the other names in this. The exception being Kate Mara. Maybe it was just the lines she was given to speak, but I think it was just her. I wasn't convinced by anything she did and every scene with her failed. Sorry. She wasn't a damsel and that's a thing I like, but I could not believe that James Purfoy fell for her for any reason other than that it was in the script.",227,1,,1,Reference to other reviews
663,2786071,2014-12-29,GusF,佩姬蘇要出嫁 (1986),,"I saw this film for the first time two or three years ago and was decidedly underwhelmed. However, as with ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""The Lady Vanishes"", I adored it on the second viewing. Kathleen Turner is excellent in the title role, playing the world weary 43-year-old Peggy Sue who finds herself in the body of her 17-year-old self to perfection. Nicolas Cage, the nephew of the director Francis Ford Coppola, is every bit her equal as her future husband Charlie. This is a very successful example of nepotism, something for which the Coppola family is well known. In recent years, he's become almost a parody of himself and has starred in some awful films but this is one of his best ones.The film has a very strong supporting cast with the exception of Sofia Coppola, a less successful example of nepotism. What's really interesting about it is that it features three actors (Cage, Jim Carrey and Joan Allen) near the beginning of their careers who went on to bigger things in major or supporting roles and lovely cameos from three elderly actors (Leon Ames in his final film, Maureen O'Sullivan and John Carradine) at or near the end of theirs. Coincidentally, I've seen the latter three in films from the 1930s and/or 1940s in the last few weeks so it's fascinating to see them in later life.The premise of the film is relatively simple but it's extraordinarily effective, extremely relatable and timeless. We all wonder what it would be like to live our lives over again knowing what we do now and we all wish that we could see dead parents, grandparents, etc. so we can tell them how much we love them and miss them.

666,2014532,2010-09-03,jjohns33,Machete (2010),8.0,"This film is what it says it is. Nothing less. And perhaps a little more. Most of Machete's critics that have given overall negative reviews, have fallen into a trap of their own devices. Machete is an exploitation film and was advertised as such. By definition, and exploitation film will include excessive violence, gore, nudity, and be high on intentional corny lines while low on plot devices and character development. To give low ratings to Machete because of one's distaste for the genre, would be like saying ""The Shinning was awful because I don't like horror."" This is one of Rodriguez best films to date, side by side with Sin City (2005). Machete delivers on all accounts of action, gore, nudity, and corny lines. The plot is simple, but honestly, that's how it should be. The thing that sets this apart from other exploitation films is that the acting is top notch. I personally found that the three main female characters to be the most intriguing and diverse.Jessica Alba plays the part of an ICE agent struggling with her loyalty to her nation and her people. She slowly begins to question her own logic on if people should follow law simply because they are laws. We see this struggle immediately, when she approaches a taco stand (apparently once every week) to by a coffee and lunch, despite her own people feeling from her site. Why does she continue this ritual? She says it is to check the papers of the character Luz, but really it is to try and hold onto a sliver of identity among her people. Michelle Rodriguez plays said Luz (aka She) as an underground leader of illegal immigration. The character of Luz is a simple woman who believes in not bending to the broken system, but fighting for her people (the mirror image of Alba). ""She"" is only a myth on which Luz has built a cult following, understanding that sometimes being a myth can do more damage than flesh and blood. By the end of the film, Luz is reborn as the mythical She, just in time for the bloody battle.Finally, the actress that surprised me the most was Lindsay Lohan. Despite only receiving 10-15 minutes of screen time (most are which she is undressed), she plays her character perfectly and flawlessly. The role seems to be written specifically for her and I applaud her for stepping up and taking on such a mature role. One of her first scenes is a tongue-in-cheek conversation about how she needs to give the people of the internet what they want, and that is more of her. Lohan played the part beautifully (in all aspects) and specks of talent are clearly visible. I hope that filmmakers and audiences (as well as herself) continue to allow her opportunities to showcase that talent. Machete is an exploitation film at its finest. And, for the most part, if you are the type of cinema attendee who wants to see a movie called Machete in the first place, chances are you will be thoroughly entertained.",513,1,,0,No reference

Furthermore, Jason Bateman was reminiscent of Ron Livingston in Office Space, or perhaps Tom Hanks in either The 'Burbs or Joe Versus the Volcano.

Although we did not fly during filming, the illusion of flight in the film is convincing.

674,3901412,2018-12-17,ElMaruecan82,The Quiet Man (1952),8.0,"In 1941, John Ford directed one of his best and most personal movies: ""How Green Was My Valley"" it was also his only Best Picture.The film was a nostalgic ride over a Welsh mining town shot in all black-and-white so both of the titular green and Maureen O'Hara fiery red hair were left to our imagination. The monochrome choice had also the merit to camouflage the Californian setting, as war made any overseas shooting impossible.Interestingly, despite the 'Welsh' cultural mark, the film was also a tribute to Ford's Irish ancestry. He even challenged purists by having many Irish actors play Welsh characters. It is possible that Ford thought this was the closest he would get to his roots so he let his sentimental self take the command of the camera. In 1951, he finally had the opportunity to honor Eire by adapting short story by Maurice Walsh, whose rights were bought in the early 30s.But how can one possibly imagine a tribute to Ireland in black-and-white or devoid of that so particular green? The Emerald Isle was a jewelry box out of which John Ford had to forge a gem... and it was ""The Quiet Man"", a film of temper and tenderness... and for once, a really green valley! You just can't cheat with the old country especially since no war has raised its ugly head to prevent Ford from taking a long vacation and bring his long-time partner John Wayne and the beautiful Maureen O'Hara for what would be one of his signature films.With ""The Quiet Man"", John Ford finally proves his statement right as he said: ""None of my so called better pictures are westerns."" I've enjoyed many of his Westerns but I admired the non-Western ones for the temperament they deployed without any fancy directing or elaborate storytelling, Ford just knew how to get the right effects. And ""The Quiet Man"" for that matter puts you immediately at ease, like the first sips of a pint of Guinness.Though the opening credits use a beautiful coastal view under a bright sunset, the film doesn't lay the green color at first but starts with the stranger's homecoming. Sean Thornton, the American coming back to his native Ireland and asking for a village named Insfree, a simple question that sets the tone and invite the first chuckles. So we'll deal with the colorful and sentimental Ireland and John Wayne didn't come to kick some ass or start some quarrel. In this appeasing mood, we appreciate his welcoming by the elfin-like Michaeleen played by the irresistible Barry Fitzgerald.The town's matchmaker (and occasional bookmaker) discovers that the big hunk of a man (one foot taller) is the little Sean he saw grow up and move to Pittsburgh, back to claim the land that belonged to his deceased parents, determined to start a new life in the green cradle. The exposition allows us to encounter in once all the players of that farcical melodrama. Ward Bond is the town priest. Catching Sean's eye is Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate Danaher, the turbulent sister of Squire Will Danaher, a loud-mouthed self-centered bully (a scene-stealing over-the-top,Victor McLaglen) who won't have any outsider stepping on his territory, let alone the land he intends to buy from the rich Widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick).This will obviously complicate the love story going between Sean and Mary Kate, till marriage and even beyond. There might be bar brawls and big fistfights but maybe because there's always something worth all these shenanigans and deep inside, the Irish people are all proud of their traditions. Sean Thornton will learn at his expenses why America might have some roots in Ireland but is not Ireland. And it takes some great deal of courage from Wayne to play the part of a man branded as coward because in this cultural immersion.Of course he has his reasons and we know it's only a matter of time before the two distinguished gentlemen let the fists talk but ""The Quiet Man"" hides behind its comedic and romantic façade a great deal of knowledge about Ireland's traditions and the way they forged the temperament of many Americans whether born in the country or in America. There are many parts in the film that would be considered politically incorrect by our standards, but who would dare to call Wayne abusive or O'Hara submissive? The couple is certainly not mismatched when it comes to principles.Some would take a dowry as a symbol of oppressive patriarchy but Mary Kate isn't concerned with the money but what it represents, her emancipation, she's unchained by an institution like everyone else but not her free will. It's actually the men who learn humbling lessons in the film as if sometimes, one should consider the value of traditions before embracing everything from the modernity. Well, it's possible that the film has a few chauvinistic undertones but they never to be taken seriously, and well, sometimes the old-fashioned ways have their charm, and d it's precisely because a movie like ""The Quiet Man"" aged a lot that it feels so new and exhilarating.Ever since I discovered Ireland, I had a soft spot for that country and I envy those who have that tradition pumping in their blood, not denying mine of course, but it's a credit to John Ford to have made such a beautiful tribute to Ireland, visually and musically (that Victor Young's theme) that it probably made a few viewers, secretly wish they would be Irish.And just because nothing dramatic affects the film doesn't mean it's not entertaining and even thrilling in its own way, it's as quiet as its hero, calm and comprehensive on the surface but has with a few tricks under its sleeve... and knows how to make your heart pound, your jaw drop and your belly laugh!",968,0,,0,No reference

A promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution. My Super Ex-Girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience. What went wrong? The cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and I didn't like the way they played it out. I was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film. However, they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho. It just wasn't very fresh and after about forty minutes, the film wore out it's welcome. Sure, there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out.

Director Ivan Reitman has lost his touch. After a successful run in the eighties and early nineties, he started making crap like Evolution and Father's Day. I wouldn't say My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a complete bust but I don't give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds, which isn't too much. Don Payne did an awful job with the screenplay. The majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just one-note. He also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times.

A few of the actors were good enough to save the film. Uma Thurman was great as G-Girl and she had many funny lines. Luke Wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting. I don't think he makes for an appealing leading man and he's better in supporting roles like in The Family Stone. Anna Faris was just doing her ""Scary Movie"" routine and it's getting a little old. She needs a challenge or at least some better scripts. Wanda Sykes is either hit or miss for me. She was great in Monster-In-Law and she was bad in Clerks 2. Here, she is just annoying and doesn't bring anything to the movie. Eddie Izzard was alright, nothing special. Rainn Wilson was just annoying and not funny. Overall, I was disappointed with the movie. It wasn't awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average. Rating 5/10",438,0,,0,No reference

The familiar elements of the Star Wars universe, overlaid with realistic warfare that has never been so front and center in a Star Wars movie, lays the groundwork for a truly astounding story and action packed movie experience. Indeed there are a few drawn out scenes and mundane monologues building up to larger story arcs as there is with any movie at over 120 minutes in length. After all, how else would Hollywood make our $20 IMAX 3D tickets worth the price tag. But what viewers gets in return for their patience as the story tellers lay the necessary ground work in Act 1 and 2 is an astounding Act 3 that lands blows the audience may not have been expecting. The ending battle sequence is fantastic visually and does wonders with respect to proper pace, relevant content, and of course X-Wings, lots and lots of X-Wings. The creators of this movie from day one declared this movie a spin-off film, making it very clear that they would be slightly veering from the normal Star Wars form of story telling while still respecting the universe in which it exists. This remained consistent when the title logo was released without the ever so recognizable franchise insignia, the introduction of the ""A Star Wars Story"" tag line, and a promise of no opening crawl. And that's exactly what we got. A story set within the Star Wars universe that contained a perfect addition of brand new elements, purposeful hints of old elements, and a climax that forces the crimson red blood in viewers hearts to pump with vigor until the closing credits roll.

Paired with Bell's confusion and creepiness, it adds up to more of an emotional mystery than a murder one. In many ways it's a wonderful coming of age tale, that delicately approaches the mind of a teenager. It bridges the gaps between anger, madness, and danger.

1. Amazing acting from most of the cast. Especially the professor. This is what carries the show.
2. Some of the script. The clever ideas from the professor, like when they switch the masks of everybody so the two SWAT team guys cannot infiltrate. Also when they put a hidden microphone in the glasses of Angel.
3. Good intro song.
4. Great disguises of the heroes when they finish the heist.
5. Bella Ciao song.Bad Things
1. It was nice one time when the Denver and Berlin pulled Guns at each other in the toilet, because Denver was in love with Monica. However, after that this trick of ""pulling guns at each other without shooting"" has been used sooo many times that it is too much.
2. Characters creating drama for no reason, just to make something happen or to help the plot. For example, when Tokyo suddenly pulls a gun on Berlin (Russian roulette), and then later Berlin throws her out of the bank. This was a very stupid decision from Tokyo, and no one would do that in real life.
3. Berlin Sacrificing himself in the end, when there was no need for it. They could just have gone in the tunnel and then blow it up. A person sacrificing himself is already a cliché, so when it is being used it must make sense and be very clever.
4. The SWAT team waited to storm the building until the LAST MOMENT when the robbers finished to print all the money. In the begging they were worried about hostages and in the end they didn't care. That is a very sudden change of mind from the police/government, which is convenient for the plot. I think that they should either storm the building right away, or not storm it at all to try and save the hostages.
5. When the SWAT team actually storm the building, we see the most stupid and unrealistic gun fight. Both sides shoot at each other for a long time and no one gets killed.
6. The scene with Tokyo is coming back through the main door on a motorcycle WITHOUT GETTING SHOT. That is just unbelievable and unrealistic. Even when the professor saves her from an armed police transportation, that is just too much. I mean these guys are already stealing 2,4 billion euro or whatever, but now they also have to be like superman/wonder woman and get Tokyo away from an armed police truck. Tokyo should not have been acting stupid from the beginning and then all that other stuff would not have happened.
7. Not everything has to be in the last second. Raquel gives the address of professors secret location to the Swat team, and they storm the place 1-2 minutes after the heroes escape
8. The scene where the professor smashes the coffee cup from grandmothers hand. If the grandmother cannot remember that, then how the is she able to take care of her granddaughter and herself?
9. Unrealistic portrayal of gunshot wounds. When Arturo and Monica get shot, they get a small surgery and in a couple of days they are okay. In real life, if someone gets shot in the shoulder or in the leg, they would probably take months if not years to recover. I don't know the exact timeline, but it is not a few days. You can google it if you want.
10. Like other reviewers have pointed out, they are the bad guys, so it does not make sense to just let them get away with the money to live in Paradise. Instead maybe they could have burned the money and give some sort of message to the government. It is like the movie ""Inside Man"" where they also rob a bank, but they don't take any money, they only steal some documents to bring down a corrupt former nazi guy. Or maybe they should just end up in jail, I don't know what exactly, but there has to be some consequences or some good-moral-reason-explanation to why they are doing it. Or else this whole ""resistance"" and bella ciao theme does not make sense if they just drink Pina Colada in the Caribbean.
11. Season 3, 4.Other Notes
The relationship between the professor and Raquel has some similarities with Breaking Bad. Here I mean Walter and Hank.The idea of giving hostages the same disguise as the robbers is from the movie ""Inside Man""",742,1,other reviewers pointed out,1,Reference to other reviews

I've watched it twice and I'd willingly see it again.The acting is the one aspect that seems to win universal approval, and deservedly so, particularly that of Anne Hathaway. But I think it's the writer who deserves the most kudos. What I found most startling about the film was the accuracy with which it portrayed the self-absorption of drug addicts. Anybody with one in the family will recognize the symptoms on display here. More particularly, it's a feature that can be exacerbated by stints in rehab. Not that I'm decrying rehab in any way, but the intense focus in these sessions on ""self"" tends to produce even more self-obsessed people. Which can be a bit hard for others to take, as superbly demonstrated by Hathaway in this movie.The other character I was fascinated with was the mother/mother-in-law portrayed by Debra Winger. This character was a dead-ringer for someone I know only too well - wanting to keep the oar in, but strictly from a distance, with plenty of ready escape routes at hand. The writer of these characters should be congratulated.I guess the one beef I might have is why American parents in films such as this always seem to be so well off. It was the one redeeming feature of Jack Nicholson's ""About Schmidt"", that for once neither set of parents was exactly rolling in cash.Overall, a fine film, one of the best I've seen.",251,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

Seeking guidance, Mandell, who is Jewish, forgoes therapy in favor of Catholic confession with a young, slightly confused priest who occasionally emotes in epithets and owns a laserdisc copy of The Thorn Birds. To further mix matters up, Amy's friends-a too-cute married couple and an acerbic lesbian publicist-are not afraid to express their feelings, including offering misguided advice, spilling sexual secrets and committing amusing faux pas.

691,3148358,2016-09-18,tectonictom,Sing Street (2016),1.0,"The film begins well, however, it seems to be lacking the Ireland- in-the-80s vibe best captured in The Commitments. The lead actors are far too well behaved to be Irish children from that era (I experienced 1980s Ireland, so I have insight). But, gradually at first, then quickly, the plot seemed to lose cohesion and continuity. I could not tell how much time had elapsed between the scenes, and I am pretty sure there were some chronological inconsistencies that I do not now recall. If you have yet to see this cinematic abomination, leave when the protagonist's love interest leaves for England, because things are about to become absolutely unbearable. I saw the flick on a date and almost abandoned her due to the unsettling waves of cringing-shamefulness coursing through my cerebellum all the way down to my socks via my spine and sciatica. Had I been there alone, I would no doubt have biffed my Coke at the screen and walked out. But I could see that my date was loving the film, needless to say, I lost all respect for her and never called her again. It seemed designed to indulge someone's weird sugar coated fantasies. Just pure cringe. The cringe peaks at the end gig, they were supposed to be a bunch of kids playing at the school disco, but there were violins and all sorts in the mix of these utterly dreadful songs that were clearly not written by teenage boys. There was that terrible scene with the headmaster, in which the plug would literally have been pulled on the band; to say nothing of that 1950s Americana scene which almost made me defecate in my trousers. And when you thought 'OK, this must be it, the credits will surely save me', it continues. There's a particularly bad scene with the older miserable brother, where he said ""you know I used to play guitar"" and his younger brother is all surprised; how could you not know that your brother - who lives in the same house as you - plays an instrument?! Even though it started OK, the fact that it became such an omni- shambles as it progressed did irreversible and retrospective damage to the entire movie.

I don't agree with those who said Betty Grable was too old for her part. She merely *looked* old. I tried to figure out why. She was only 35 years old. She was still slim (possibly even slimmer than Lauren Bacall, who'd recently had her second child) and her face looked relatively youthful. So why did she look 45? I concluded it was the hair.

Is this as original or interesting as the normal Friends episode? No, but the characters are friendly, dealing with difficulties in their lives, and all have rather happy endings - so one is meant not to begrudge the film. But in truth it's not very good.Two characters stand out: the grandmother played by Suzanne Flon (whose name you will probably recognize) who died just after making the film, and the woman playing an actress who must display a great variety of moods, styles as we see her as a character in a staged Feydeau farce (and in rehearsals for that farce), as ""herself"" in the midst of ""real life"" career desperation, and again playing a different character in her popular television soap opera. Her range is impressive.The waitress tying the characters together is pleasant, has a pleasing figure - but in this role is rather forgettable. (Oh, there's also rather a surprise to see *** SPOILERS **** her character leap into bed with someone she's just met - the American audience is likely to be amazed since she's presented as this sweet character from the provinces - yet as she kisses this man, a man she just met, she simply begins removing her clothes for sex!

Its not as good as Tom and Jerry, The Smurfs or other great Hanna Barbera cartoons. Still there are lots of great things in it. Hanna Barbera Productions revived Droopy and Spike. Sometimes a villain can make a film or a show very memorable. I think this is the case with Tom and Jerry Kids. I thought Frank Welker's portrayal of McWolf made the show very memorable. Don Messick did a great job playing Droopy. Charles Adler also did a great job playing Dripple. Some of Droopy and Dripple shorts were good and others were just OK. But Frank Welkers's portrayal of McWolf made many of these OK shorts memorable. It must be noted that the show also has a wonderful animation. My favorite Droopy and Dripple short is Droopio and Juliet. Another thing I liked about Tom and Jerry Kids is ""sometimes"" villain characters win at the end of the short. For Example, McWolf wins at the end of the short ""A Thousand Clones."" Droopy Delivers is another short with a good ending.In Tom and Jerry Kids shorts, Young Tom also wins on some occasions. I like the idea of fair game in a cartoon. My favorite tom and Jerry short is Tulliver's Twist.To me, even a weak Hanna Barbera cartoon is better than many cartoons that is released today. Hanna Barbera made wonderful cartoons like Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, Jonny Quest, The Flinstones.

Leni Riefenstahl was not a bad actress at all but was an even better director (the latter of which she is perhaps better known for and her personal life), and when it came to films centered around adversity in the mountains it didn't get much better than Arnold Fanck when it came to direction at that particular point in film history.So it did sadden me that 'The Holy Mountain' didn't connect with me completely, being somebody that really did want to like it as Riefenstahl's directing efforts and her other mountaineering-oriented outings with Fanck have much to admire. Visually 'The Holy Mountain' is a triumph and there is some inspired direction, but it is far from exceptional story-wise and Riefenstahl went on to do much better things when her acting style matured and became more subtle and comfortable (neither of which evident here).'The Holy Mountain' has a good deal of good things. Visually it is masterly. The scenery is beautiful and atmospheric but even better is the cinematography. Not only are there some truly breathtaking images, but the moving camera and time lapse photography are so well used and make what happens raw and moving and the points of view interesting. It is a hauntingly scored film again and written with sincerity and good intentions.Fanck's direction has a lot of impressive parts, especially when capturing the intensity of the action and emotional impact of it. As there are intense and moving moments here.On the other hand, the story tends to be very dull and not particularly eventful, which may be down to that there is not a lot to it structurally and the film tried to pad it out. It is also excessively melodramatic, especially later on when it got very overwrought. The characters are underdeveloped and quite sketchy even.Generally, the acting is nothing special and Riefenstahl herself went on to much better after. Here she overdoes it quite dreadfully and Fanck's direction of her is all over the shop.In conclusion, watchable but underwhelming. 5/10",356,0,,0,No reference

Boy looks are sure deceiving. Now don't get me wrong it was a good movie but, it wasn't a great movie like it could have been. The cast was good because Catherine and John have been in another movie (High Fidelity) where they played a couple and yes it was believable. Julia of course played her cute, normal self. But, I really think that this was not her best movie. Pretty Woman, Dying Young, Sleeping with the Enemy, Mystic Pizza, and Steel Magnolias are a few of her best movies. John Cusackis a good actor who would rather do silly romantics or pure comedy. All his movies in the eighties to the nineties were very good even 2000 was good. But, 2001 for John has another sure to be a good movie called Serendipity with the girl from Pearl Harbor- Kate Beckinsale. This was definitely not his best work. As for Catherine it was good to see her play a lessdramatic character for once, because every now and then you need a break.Now for Billy Crystal, he co-wrote this movie and yes some parts were funny, but a lot of it wasn't.

Both the anti-hero, and the society he lives in (it's the Chile of Augusto Pinochet) are pretty rotten, and the film cuts neither any slack. Indeed, behind the black comedy, this is a portrait of a civilisation on the brink of collapse through a loss of respect for basic human dignity: the fake Manero desperately seeks dignity for himself in his act, but shows no respect for anyone else's. It's compelling, convincing, and yet, as a story, ever so slightly pointless: 'Satruday Night Fever' had its own redemption narrative, and while one can mock this as Hollywood softening, without any such story a film can seem slightly devoid of direction: it's hard to even imagine what a happy ending would have been for 'Tony Manero', so hopeless is the initial premise. It's still a good film; and fundamentally a political one, even though the politics is all implicit.",192,0,,0,No reference

I don't know how this got a 7.5 average rating when this finale episode sucked so bad. Wrapping things up with that obnoxious 'Chameleon' character was far-fetched, but seeing that plane explode with him on it was quite satisfying. The flashbacks with Reid while he was in a coma were exactly the schmaltzy scenes that you'd expect from such a premise, but having his schizo mom as the one to decide what kind of medical procedures he should get was absolutely ludicrous. A man as practical and pragmatic as Reid would never let his literally crazy mother be the one to decide whether he lives or dies.The last almost half of the show focused on Garcia, who was arguably the most annoying and inane character on the entire show. I can't believe the producers let her write the finale and focus mostly on herself - wretched choice! I can see why so many reviewers hated this episode for that very reason - it was completely stupid and left a bad taste in the viewers' mouths. I'm glad I wasn't a dedicated fan because I would've felt completely ripped off after investing in 14.5 seasons (this was just a half season) and having such a ridiculous sendoff as this episode.

713,2164178,2011-08-11,ElMaruecan82,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969),8.0,"If my review was a medical diagnosis, I would say ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" suffers from a benign case of cinematic schizophrenia, just as if ""The Sting"" featured a scene similar to the tollbooth massacre in ""The Godfather"".As much as I genuinely enjoyed ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", I had the strange feeling the film was constantly hesitating between two different approaches : comedy or drama, and if only had the director, George Roy Hill made a choice in both, the movie would've been perfect. And here is the first dilemma: as a comedy, it features some of the funniest lines and exchanges from American Cinema, which made the friendship more appealing in its comical aspect, and didn't fit the courses of dramatic events that would lead to the heroes' demise. While ""The Wild Bunch"" was a dramatic friendship story, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" had to be a buddy movie.My mention of Peckipah's iconic and superior film is not fortuitous. It has a lot in common with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" as both film embody the agony of the Old West myth through the introductions of new vehicles such as the car for the 'bunch' and the bicycle for the 'Butch', and the similar plot lines featuring tough guys running away, whether it's from a bunch of bounty hunters or a posse, the escape is like a symbolic exile, when the civilization has conquered the west and the only valuable direction is the South, Mexico or Bolivia  countries not contaminated by the progress, where the vestiges of the Old West still remain, where banks can still be robbed.The modern take on the Western genre is not without a bit of nostalgia, on which the use of sepia in both films is the most eloquent expression. However, western is a difficult genre to handle and probably the less compatible with the genre-binding approach. You can amplify its effects, as did Sergio Leone, increase its level of violence like Sam Peckinpah, transcend its ugliness to a hypnotic documentary-like realism like Altman with ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" or turning it into a sweet enchanting romantic comedy with self-derision as the best way to translate the way of old west frontier idealism, like ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"". But as tempting as it is, you can't do everything and I felt like Hill wanted to try every tendency to stay on the safe side, and as a credit to his talent, it's a miracle that it didn't ruin the film.Although I admire the directorial job of George Roy Hill, I suspect the desire to do something modern was inspired from the current streaks of realistic films of the 'New Hollywood' era. I mentioned, ""Wild Bunch"", ""The Graduate"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" emulated in both the opening and the concluding scene. The last shootout was a deliberate way to keep a touch of realism in the film, reminding that guns needed to be loaded too. And the explosion during the bank robbery is one of the most convincing and spectacular from any film, even by today's standards. Now, how could such perfectionism have allowed the dramatic scene when they kill the Bandidos, the slow motion was ridiculously over the top, it didn't fit the film at all. And the film features many moments that shouldn't have been there. The script introduces us to funny or colorful characters like the News reader from the gang, or the scene-stealer Strother Martin, and the way they act label them as comic relief characters, and then they are instantly killed, in the coldest and most brutal way. The shocking effect made me feel cheated. The movie's mood had to be a cheerful comedy with some dramatic undertones, and the running gag involving the Woodcock character would never have me expected the film to turn in such a dramatic series. The movie had to be a Western ""Sting"".The film's modernity relies more efficiently on its spicy humor, and the great score from Burt Bacharach, which provide a smooth iconoclast, feel to a film. But I guess the movie finally grew on me, thanks to the great chemistry going between Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and how the two characters completed each other. The lines they exchange are priceless, and full of wit, the cliff scene, the Bolivia arrival, or the issues with Spanish languages were absolutely hysterical, the kind of humor all relying on timing and body languages and that creates the charm of such movies like ""The Graduate"". It's ironic that the movie features Katharine Ross, Ellen Robinson, again in the middle of a love triangle, but Etta Place, not the typical female action-killjoy, was the icing on the cake that provided the romantic touch and a reason for the delightful musical interludes, on the top of them, one of the film's defining moments, the bicycle ride.All the way, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is the perfect example of a great film that could have been even greater if the director stay focused on one specific tone. I learned in the commentary that Hill was surprised at Newman's lack of seriousness while playing Butch, but it was the right tone, how could you make a drama out of such an outstanding script. William Goldman's Oscar-winning screenplay is a comedic goldmine transcended by Newman and Redford's chemistry, a perfect comedy works on the body languages, the looks, at one point, there's one smile Redford gives, and never had a smile made me laugh so hard.""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is redeemed by its wit, its beautiful cinematography by the master Conrad Hall, the score, the acting, and more than anything, its entertaining value. It's a classic, entertaining, Western but it could have been a masterpiece of unconventionality",965,0,,0,No reference
714,1737713,2008-12-16,ddsterrell,The Dark Knight (2008),8.0,"I am a little amazed by so many rave reviews. I did enjoy this film, but it is also seriously flawed, and that needs to be considered. Its running length was long, it was way too complicated and hard to follow, and (I can't shake this) the female lead was miscast. The first criticism may not be significant, given how long many films routinely are these days and the fact that this can easily be forgiven if it all works and one is entertained (as in ""Lord of the RIngs"", for example). But a convoluted and hard-to-follow story is a serious plotting fault and this movie has it in spades. I personally attribute this to a modern ""Video Game"" mentality and to this film probably being oriented toward a young audience reared on those games. The plot and sub plots jump all over the place and are hard to follow, some sub plots lead nowhere, often-unrecognizable characters jump in and out, and scenes are not fully fleshed out. This all creates a hyperactive feeling to the film. In a sense this works because the Joker, himself, is crazy, so that fits, and because so much eye candy is constantly being thrown at the viewers to keep them entertained. Repeated viewings will probably go a long way to clearing up many details and convoluted areas, but a good story shouldn't need that to be fully understandable. The casting of Maggie Gyllenhaul as Rachel Dawes just felt wrong to me; she is not a very attractive woman, more goofy-looking, and didn't seem to bring much weight or sizzle to the role, especially the romantic scenes. Last, and relatively minor in this age, the film is ""volume-impaired""  at times demanding seriously higher volume to understand a quiet conversation and then a major reduction in volume for the next dramatic sequence. I suspect, however, that this wouldn't bother a lot of young people who routinely listen to over-amped car and game sound systems. Worth praise foremost is Heath Ledger's take on the Joker, the great special effects and the Batpod, and the new slant on Batman as a dark scapegoat. Bottom line, however, is that in the overall scheme of things, this was not THAT great a film. Fun, good, not great. Sorry, but ""Batman Returns"" was a much better scripted and paced film.

717,1307725,2006-10-11,EUyeshima,Saving Face (2004),7.0,"First-time feature director/screenwriter Alice Wu's 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it, but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling, unforced humor and a trio of winning performances. With a conflicted protagonist at its core, the film shares the same soufflé-light rom-com territory as Ol Parker's half-hearted ""Imagine Me and You"" and Ian Iqbal Rashid's overly cute ""A Touch of Pink"". Wu, however, manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly, because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes.The plot focuses on Wil, short for Wilhelmina, an obviously talented Manhattan-based surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional Chinese family living across the East River in Flushing. Referred to just as ""Ma"" in the story, her mother is a widowed beautician, who only speaks Mandarin to her daughter and keeps flinging potential suitors at her. Wil's eyes, nevertheless, are set squarely on a comely ballerina named Vivian, who happens to be the daughter of Wil's supervising surgeon at the hospital. Meantime, Ma is in her own pickle as she finds herself pregnant and subsequently ejected from the family home. Ma moves in with Wil, and the inevitable consequences ensue. There are affecting moments of lightness and gravitas throughout, but much of the charm of the film comes naturally from the three leads.As Wil, Michelle Krusiec is a terrific find, evoking the simmering turmoil of her situation in unexpected ways even when the script fails her at times. Lynn Chen is saucy and inviting as Vivian, though I wish we could have seen one scene where she dances onstage since such a strong point is made on what style she wants to pursue. Both actresses make the attraction between the characters palpable, culminating in the inevitable girl-on-girl scene. Despite the beauty of her younger co-stars, Joan Chen is almost too gorgeous to be playing such an emotionally constrained character. Even though her character is supposed to be closing in on fifty, Chen is just 43 and frankly looks ensconced in her thirties, making her the rare case of looking far younger at the end of the movie than at the beginning. Yet, she is able to convey the necessary brittle, distanced manner as Ma, making her character's self-discovery process more rewarding.The ending is on the pat side, especially a silly multiple confessional at a wedding and a wedged-in riff on ""The Graduate"", but it doesn't compromise the sweet-natured charm of the piece. Special mention should go to Harlan Bosmajian's cinematography, which captures the saturated colors found in the Chinese-American community. The 2005 DVD contains Wu's thoughtful commentary on a separate track, as well as several deleted scenes, a standard, ten-minute making-of featurette and a rather dull Sundance video diary.",473,0,,0,No reference

""Toy Story 3"" successfully continues the Pixar tradition of excellence in animation and film story-telling that began 15 years ago with the first ""Toy Story."" I don't know how they do it but the excellent screenwriters was able to shake up the old ""Toy Story"" themes of abandonment, friendship and loyalty into this wonderful script bursting with fresh humor, exciting action and above all, rich and heart-warming emotion. Never mind that we were watching toys on screen, but these characters were as real as people we hold dear. We are drawn into their dilemmas and we root for them to find their salvation.That hyper-exciting nail-biting scene in the garbage-disposal facility is a masterpiece in suspense. I was in awe at the vivid and highly complex sequence of animation on screen. When I looked at my 8 year old son beside me, he too was in total awe. It was amazing.If the last Pixar film ""Up"" made us cry in the first 10 minutes, I think there was no dry eye in the theater (especially adults) in the last 10 minutes of ""Toy Story 3"". The sincerity of the dialogue and the highly charged execution was beautiful.

720,1236709,2006-07-06,tuttle-46,High Tension (2003),9.0,"!!!Major Spoilers Ahead!!! From all the comments I've seen about this movie, on Amazon.com and on this website, most of the complaints have to do with how ""irrational"" or ""absurd"" the ending is. The key to understanding the ending is to understand that the division of the main character into two people is not a literal, physical division. IT IS FIGURATIVE.Many have harped on the fact that because the girl and the man are driving two separate vehicles in the chase scene and she is wounded in the wreckage, the fact that she and the man are the same person doesn't make sense. Let me explain again: IT IS FIGURATIVE. It is not meant to be indicative of what happens to her body, but what is happening to her mind.In plain English: the good side of her (the girl) is fighting the evil side of her (the man) for dominance. When she beats him up with the barb-wire post, she is trying to reclaim her compassion and humanity. When he runs her off the road, he is trying to establish his deranged superiority. In plainer English: Duh.This also explains why he can anticipate her evasive moves with intelligence. Things that normal stupid slashers wouldn't take into account, he does - and with breathtaking suspense. He is more canny than your average slasher and she is more savvy than your average heroine. This is because he IS her and the two parts of her consciousness have some rudimentary communication. For example, he checks the sink in her guest bathroom to see if it's been used. She has already wiped it down. He lifts up the foot of the mattress. She has anticipated this and has drawn her feet up. In the gas station, he has a suspicion that the clerk was ""looking at"" something. The security camera while he's in the store is showing us what SHE thinks it would show. She takes the gun, but he's already taken the bullets. Most of the movie is from HER point of view - which means a lot of what happens is in her imagination. Again, IT IS FIGURATIVE.It may have escaped attention that the head fellating the man at the beginning of the film looks amazingly like Alex's head? Why would the swing be empty just after Marie sees Alex naked in the shower? Is it just coincidence that during Marie's masturbation scene, the man pulls up in the van, getting ready to do his business? Could it be that her attraction to Alex is the trigger?C'mon people. This is not lazy film-making. It is existential film-making and lazy film-watching. Turn off your reality TV (the true opiate of the masses). Replace it with about an hour of introspective thinking a night. Ponder the universe inside your navel. Let the thinking side of your brain (the good side) overcome the indolent side of your brain (the bad side). Repeat until you feel your analytical powers returning to you.

I don't think the bear was purposely trying to hurt him because it appeared that the dog was more aggressive. The bear was just trying to evade him. But anyway, I think the whole point to this film is that friendships are very powerful if both parties really care for one another like the way Fish Hawk and Corby did. I feel that Fish Hawk was like a second father figure to Corby. Too many times people take friendships for granted and as a result of it, many friendships never last long. I know this from personal, first-hand experience.But the real sad part of this story is when the lady of the house went behind Fish Hawk's back to make racist remarks! It was not only her.

All the other family friends tried forcing alcohol down Fish Hawk's throat but he stood his ground and told them all to just back off.

729,1842711,2009-08-13,chuck-526,Tulpan (2008),7.0,"I watched Tulpan for the second time last night. It seems to me the movie is really about how different people react to wrenching changes, mostly by nursing a fantasy of some sort. Among other things Tulpan documents the _current_ way people and sheep use that steppe, which under the surface isn't very nice.As the ""yurt"" is a touchstone with the past, it's commonly retained even though it doesn't actually make much sense any more. These herdsmen move very infrequently (if at all), and these yurts are typically surrounded by outbuildings that look pretty permanent. What good really is a moving house if you don't move? The person who insists Asa must be married before getting any sheep is ""Comrade Boss"" (not brother-in-law Ondas - Asa and Ondas have their differences, but the assignment of sheep is not among them). Ondas and his family cannot move without approval from the Boss. The Boss controls the only veterinarian and most of the vehicles. The Boss tells Ondas he's responsible for every stillborn lamb. All this adds up to the current economic pattern in that area: herds of sheep belong to non-resident owners, who ""contract"" their care to the actual herdsmen. The herdsmen live sort of like their ancestors, but don't actually own most of the sheep, seldom move, and don't have all that much freedom.Daughter Beke (and also to some extent her mother and Asa's sister Samal) appear to cope with the dichotomy between the idealized life and the actual life of a herdsman's family by rather defiantly singing lots of folk songs. Perhaps the folk songs are just the most visible sign of fantasizing the old ways.Tractor driver Boni survives the dichotomy by diving deeply into a fantasy pastiche of music, sex, and wealth. He's the conduit to the ""outside"", and so is more worldly than the herdsmen he serves. But by more objective standards he's woefully uninformed too. At one point he speaks of bypassing the city and going directly to Sakhalin Island. Never mind that Sakhalin Island is in a different country thousands of miles away through several other countries.Asa appears to survive the dichotomy by remaining completely unaware of it. He admires a solar panel in a magazine, without ever realizing no herdsman could possibly afford such a thing. He admires a motorcycle in the magazine too, but without ever reflecting such a thing would be useless without a reasonably accessible supply of gasoline. He compliments Tulpan on wanting to go to college at the same time he wants her to marry him, without any sense that it might be difficult to do both. The scene he draws on his collar is of an idealized herdsman with healthy children (not the half-crazy kids he actually lives with), his own herd of sheep, more wealth than any real herdsman ever had, and the freedom to move wherever he wishes whenever he wishes.Brother-in-law Ondas clings to the old ways even though they don't quite add up any more. He invests a lot of time and effort in quixotic visits to Tulpan's yurt that are doomed from the start. He doesn't know his ""neighbors"". Although they politely receive him, they apparently weren't ever expecting a marriage proposal visit and don't know quite how to deal with one. Ondas's gift looks like an electric light fixture -with lots and lots of little pieces to keep clean- intended for an elegant room. It wouldn't be of any use in a yurt with dust (and a little smoke?) and no electricity. And he talks of giving a large number of sheep too, never mind that the sheep don't seem to be his to give, or that talking of a large number of sheep in the context of marriage seems irrelevant. The scenic views of far away horizons and sparse vegetation portray what I'd call a semi-desert. Just try to imagine a ""tulip"" sprouting up between those tufts. If you can imagine it at all, it will look horribly out of place. Likewise the tulip Asa draws into the scene on his collar is in a different style and colors than the rest.

Some of those i could understand because of the time limit they had, but most of them were changed while in the same amount of time they could had shown the scene like in the book. an example is when Lt. collet approached langdon to take him to the Louvre. in the book this happens at night while langdon is asleep in his hotel room and get a phone call from the reception that someone likes to speak with him(this is collet). in the movie collet approached langdon while he is autographing his book after his presentation. the time they used for this scene was enough to do it like it is described in the book. more like this happens in the movie, which i cant use all now.when you watch the movie without have read the book, you will like it. maybe there is 1 thing that can be disturbing, at least i did find disturbing, it was the speed of the story. every time they found a clue, they knew what it meant or solved it quick.finally, for the ones who haven't seen the movie, go to the movie because its nice, but don't expect too much of it.robin",255,0,,0,No reference

I think she takes pride in her race and nationality. I don't know whether this story in nonfiction, but it is the truth that people who were proud of being the Jewish people such as the little girl were persecuted, so this film is short but I think it taught us the important thing we must nit forget. This film's title, ""Porcelain Unicorn"" fills the important role in this film. I think this beautiful porcelain unicorn show the Jewish people. The little girl treasured it.

This inevitably leads to his suspension from UCOS although it turns out this was his plan all along as he believes the officer he hit was culpable for a death in custody many years before and he plans to expose the truth at the enquiry. Soon after the rest of the team are called in when an ex-Argentine pistol is found; it is linked to two murders; one in England; the other, many years earlier, in Gibraltar.This proves an excuse for the team to head to The Rock to follow leads there. It won't be easy though as at the time of the murder Gibraltar was full of servicemen returning from victory in the Falklands and the weapon was almost certainly a souvenir brought back from the South Atlantic by a soldier. Their investigation will mean working with the local police and dealing with the military. They also get help from an unlikely source when Brian turns up although Sandra wants him on the next plane home!One could be excused for thinking the series might be getting a bit stale by now but on the strength of this two-part story I'm not so sure. The case was interesting without being too convoluted and there were plenty of laughs to be had most notably when Brian and Gerry get trapped in an empty shipping container and find themselves in Spain! The resolution of the case was well handled; giving a rather poignant ending rather than a confrontation one might expect that confrontation was left for Brian's enquiry and is likely to leave viewers wanting to cheer as Brian has words with the man he hit! As always the whole cast do a fine job but most notable is Alun Armstrong who is great as Brian.

Does the movie capture a large portion of the depth of feeling and feel of the groundbreaking manga written by Yukito Kishiro? ABSOLUTELY!!! Frankly, I was worried about this release. The trailers looked promising, but all too often with these sorts of projects, the screen writers fail to truly understand and therefore connect with the source material, and even though this script/screenplay is not Cameron's best work, the shear power and dynamism of the original manga somehow pushes through as does the creator's love for it.

Flippen. Most of the actors were quite prolific and enjoyed long careers as character actors. Nielsen's career spanned over sixty years, and he lived long enough to re-invent himself in comic roles and start a new career.The story concerns honeymooners, the Partains (Nielsen and Colleen Miller), who are staying at a cabin near a small town. Bill Partain has been fired from his newspaper, and he gets wind of a big story that could win him his job back. A well-known thief, Tom Ellis (Robert Wilke), has struck again, and a bank employee was killed. He's hiding out nearby. No one in the town wants to help Partain find Ellis or his wife Ruth, who lives separately from him, because it's a poor town and Ellis has helped many of them for a long time. When Partain finally finds Ellis and interviews him, the actions of one of Ellis' psycho partners (Richards) make Partain a hostage.This isn't a bad B movie. As a B movie made in black and white, it does have a TV feel to it. Richards handles a showy role well. Colleen Miller, who plays Nielsen's wife, had a difficult role; the wife was sort of a pain. The attractive Miller retired a year later when she married Ted Briskin, a wealthy man previous married to Betty Hutton.Worth watching for the young Nielsen, and if you're my age, the actors will bring back memories for you.",274,0,,0,No reference

Comedians of all manner spill the beans on what it takes and what it gives; the long road, dismal motel rooms, the loneliness, the hecklers, the boos, and the glorious highs of honing a set, capturing an audience, winning them over, and reaching a pitch where everything kills.The film fully resonates with my experience as a stand-up, and as a film, I appreciated its tonality, showcasing the comedians telling their stories in raw B/W, with B-roll of the clubs, cafés, and the road shot in color. It may be confirmation bias, but I found myself voicing ""yes"", ""exactly"", and pointing at the screen as I recognized the experiences and emotions.While the film is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the breadth and depth of how many comedians took part, I kept waiting in anticipation to see several more; Bill Burr, Louis CK #metoo, Zach Galifanakis, Todd Barry, Paula Poundstone, Lilly Tomlin, Tig Nayarit, David Cross, etc.9/10",227,0,,0,No reference

Now, I didn't know anything about the movie. I just saw some good reviews and it looked like it will have a heavy dose of 80s Nostalgia+gave me Stranger Things vibes, so I gave it a shot.The story is nothing new. And the movie definitely has cliches that come with stories like these. But at the same time, the execution of the story and how it ends not only surprised me but also made me have a great time pretty much throughout. It reminded me a lot of movies like Disturbia, and also Stranger Things as I thought it would. It's a mix of elements from the two giving you a heavy dose of 80s Nostalgia which I appreciated a lot.The acting was great. The main four teens, in particular, did an awesome job. You could actually feel they are best buds and I liked seeing them work together. I also liked the moments between Nikki and Davey (the main couple you could say). They were sweet.I loved how the movie felt very grounded pretty much throughout. It's not something like The Babysitter where Juda Lewis (one of the main teens) performed in too, dude is great in both btw. It feels grounded because the story is simple and the movie doesn't try to make you suspend your disbelief all that much. Instead, the movie uses great cinematography and AWESOME music to elevate the scenes it has and it constantly keeps you interested by keeping you in a state of doubt for most of the movie. And on top of that still manages to surprise you in the final act.From the very first scene, I was in love with the soundtrack. The movie goes all in with Synthwave and it was just magnificent. And the movie utilizes it properly all the time. You see, the movie takes a lot of time setting up the story and creating tension. So much so that it's pretty much a slow burn in a way but one that is done right. Even small scenes or mundane stuff feels better when shot properly and accompanied by great music. And because of that, there was this constant vibe that, if like me, you love about these movies, you'll usually end up having a good time.The movie wasn't perfect, though. Some of the writing was weak, a plot point or two were just stupid. And I wish the final act didn't felt like it was somewhat rushed. I loved how the main story was resolved but it also felt like the movie ends a bit too quickly after that.All in all, this was a pleasant surprise. I wanted a good 80s nostalgia movie and this movie gave me just that plus more. It was fun, it was shocking and tense at times, and it was just plain entertaining. If this is your kind of stuff, I'd recommend giving this a shot.And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10.",540,1,,0,No reference

Especially strange as this is the opening scene of new Showrunner John Nathan Turner's era and one would think he would want a more interesting, striking, exciting or funny opening. The opening we get is pretty dull and odd. After that we get a flawed adventure which never reaches top standard and has various aspects which are weak but overall I feel it is overly criticised. I think it is okay. It is quite entertaining, especially in the middle parts.The tone is far less zany and comedic than the Graham Williams produced era which had just ended and has a more serious feel along with efforts to be intellectual and use high scientific ideas. It is not all convincing and some of it seems a bit flaky but the ambition is admirable.Tom is better in this more reined in style in my opinion but the script often fails to let him shine. It is interesting and dramatic when he gets aged by a machine and that is the highlight for me.The plot is decent and the Argolins who run a leisure complex with hidden things going on are good in concept. They look a bit over the top but it works okay while the ideas of their race dying out etc work well. The Foamasi are cleverly used as unseen mysterious characters who seem menacing and intriguing until they appear fully at which point the costumes let it down.There is plenty of good acting from numerous cast members and the dialogue is mostly fine. Romana and K-9 provide support and moments of camaraderie.Overall I find enough of interest to make this a reasonable effort.My ratings: Part 1 - 7/10, Parts 2 & 3 - 8/10, Part 4 - 7/10.

But rather in the marketing of clichés, comprising the desires and fears that inhabit the emotional landscape of the masses. They are consequently not very nice people, as their engines are fueled on cynicism and blind greed. And if there isn't a Russian communist, Muslim or impertinent bacillus to pillory—easy targets of hatred—they feel impelled to turn to other pop icons of loathing. In this case, lesbians. As presumed by this writer, the only women evil enough to reject acceptable norms of decency and basic human compassion are women who have no need of men. Especially ones who are this extraordinarily beautiful. These particular producers also perhaps hoped to cash in on the titillation that girl-on-girl action might arouse in the segment of straight men who buy into that erotic trope. That being said, these are all marvelous actors whom I admire profoundly. Their work here is excellent. Would that they had had the altruism to sniff out the rot at the core of this apple. In addition to the trite homophobia, this movie fails for two additional lapses in reason. Rooney Mara's character performs a grotesquely brutal act that would make a navy seal squeamish, let alone a Greenwich princess. But of course, someone who could perform lesbian sex is, by definition, a subhuman, a monster. The other big fantasy is that Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, a psychiatrist, has enough money and Wall Street savvy to buy enough devalued stock to make her filthy rich. Rich enough to require two foreign bank accounts. If it were that easy, wouldn't Pfizer have cashed in on that game decades ago?

I had been following a bit of the hype and viral marketing that went along with the film and was excited about seeing it.I just saw the first screening here in NZ and again it was great. The way the movie is all shot with hand held was really cool and made the film really visceral and real. I know people were moaning a bit about the shaky camera, but I actually found myself questioning it in parts because it wasn't shaky enough. The whole thing really worked.I was a little skeptical about it being a J.J. Abrams production however, as he annoyed me with Lost and never answering questions and replacing them with new ones etc. But there was sufficient info given in the movie as to not feel like you were left severely hanging at the end. There are questions left unanswered which is understandable considering it is just these peoples video account.The monster was pretty cool and you get to see pretty much the entire thing throughout the film. It also carries some scary cargo which it drops all over the place that make for a tense subway run. All in all I was pretty satisfied with the monster, except for its apparent invulnerability.Because it was a movie it did have to have a bit of a story and it mostly revolves around the relationship between Rob and his long time friend, recently love interest, Beth. This part was what made me drop this to a 9 and not a 10. It was a little corny that this guy would risk his life and the lives of his friends to go back into the city where a giant monster is, to save his girlfriend who is almost certainly dead anyway. It didn't make a lot of sense and I don't think people can relate to it, I know I really couldn't. I did on many occasions just think ""why aren't they getting the hell out of the city?"" or ""what the hell is he thinking?!"". This was my feeling mainly when he decides to go inside Beth's apartment building which has collapsed onto another one, you'll see...However leaving the main story behind and focusing on the rest of the film it is an awesome ride and a very original monster film. It warrants another watch for the experience of being there all over again. I doubt a sequel will follow however it would be nice to have it wrapped up in a nice neat little package, but I imagine that will spoil the feel of the film.Although not for everyone (especially those with severe motion sickness), Cloverfield lives up to the hype and is a fabulous way to spend $15.

Straight Outta Compton attempts to tell their story from their roots in Compton to their eventual and inevitable break up.The members of NWA that the film follows are MC Ren, DJ Yella, Eazy- E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, but the story primarily focuses on the latter three and the disagreements that led to NWA's demise. Simultaneously, Straight Outta Compton examines the societal landscape and cultural turmoil happening at the time that led to the voices of NWA being heard and celebrated.The sheer volume of narrative that needs to be told in the film is gargantuan. Unfortunately for the screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff, they are not successful and the whole story feels like a Wikipedia version of NWA. A film of this size should reveal some additional unknown information or motivation, and it fails to do so. Further the constant contemplation upon the LA riots and that time period feels overly forced to reflect our current situation, a heavy handed and unnecessarily graceless approach.The other greatest criticism is its dollar store approach to the costume and hair design on the film. Perhaps it is because the 90's weren't that long ago that those alive recall the style and fashion, but it's pretty abominable in Straight Outta Compton. None of the actors look to be comfortable in their garbs and the limited diversity in outfits leads the audience to believe each character only had one costume each. The whole look of the time created in Straight Outta Compton is immediately off-putting and difficult to get past.The film isn't all bad, and the best decision the filmmakers made was to get Ice Cube's real son to portray Ice Cube in the film. Not only does O'Shea Jackson Jr. look startlingly similar to his father, but his performance is the only complex one. Rather than reverting to a constant scowl and mean mugging the camera, his performance is of a man across many years. O'Shea is the only actor able to rise above his poor costuming and inhabit the role completely, then again, he has had his whole life to observe his father.The story behind Straight Outta Compton was always going to be a difficult task, but to those aware of the NWA story, it could have been better. In the end, it feels like a highlight reel, glossing over the details to help audiences fully understand the inner- workings of its downfall and the complex happenings between Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. And for a film about a music group, more rap and hip-hop music from the time would have been greatly appreciated.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",466,0,,0,No reference
761,206089,2000-08-28,inclass,I Love Melvin (1953),10.0,"This movie really lets you know that back in the 50's, they really knew how to make an excellent musical! The cast includes Donald O'Connor as Melvin, a small-time photographer working for ""Look"" Magazine. He turns his attention and camera to Judy LeRoy, a beautiful dancer who dreams of making it big one day, played by Debbie Reynolds. The songs in this film are wonderfully written and performed, including a very charming outdoor song and dance routine performed by O'Connor and the film's youngest actress, 9 year old Noreen Corcoran, who brightens the many scenes she's in, playing Judy's sister, Clarabelle, who seems to like to be involved in everything. (The songs have very clever lyrics as well!) Melvin seeks to win the hand of Judy, but her usual date, Harry Black (Richard Anderson), who's pretty much a square, is about to pop the question to the delight of Judy's dad, while her dad dislikes Melvin. O'Connnor and Reynolds are brilliant. Jim Backus adds some laughs also. The whole cast comes together to make this a delightful film, which is yet another great one that was overlooked by video & DVD companies! A MUST SEE!

762,928590,2005-03-30,hotmaledot1,Breaker Morant (1980),1.0,"A friend found this for me down the local library, we watched it together and found it highly entertaining.

I then did a little research on the subject and discovered the truth.

I am all for learning from the mistakes of the past, I hate things being brushed over.

But this film is absolutely awful in regards that it simply tells lies.

If you want an entertaining film watch this, if you want to learn something give it a miss.

763,1487543,2007-07-28,shunkawea,Dirty Work (2006),10.0,"One of the best, and most realistic of the film noir genre, in my opinion. Almost all of the major characters in the movie operate in government or in the underworld, and they are all corrupt, or at least somewhat so: look around you and you'll find that to be a reflection of today's reality. Also, there's little-to-no exposition: characterization and plot complication are the keys to understanding what's going on in this film, and I find that challenging and interesting, because it again reflects the reality of how one discerns meaning in real life. The twisty plot unfolds only as we learn who's who, and why they do what they do. The resolution is one of the most neatly drawn I've ever seen: all the disparate subplots come coherently together (a la Shakespeare!). This is a thinking person's movie, definitely not for the jejune who need to have characters tell them what's happening in a movie through usually extraneous dialog. Excellent performances: Lance Reddick, Nutsa Kukhianidze, and Austin Pendleton (one of the greatest villains I've ever seen on the screen).",181,0,,0,No reference
764,4148180,2019-04-30,krs_is_cool,"Game of Thrones: The Long Night (2019) Season 8, Episode 3",9.0,"People have been making predictions and speculations as to the ending since series 1. To say that this goes against all the build up from the last 7 seasons is like saying you knew what was going to happen. You didn't. Know one other than the showrunners and G.R.R.M knew and they made this ending based on advice FROM G.R.R.M.
People saying this was not Game of Thrones obviously have missed the point. Since series 1 these charachters have been fighting unbeatable odds and the top 10 charachters (for screen time) have all survived, John - granted he died but was obviously redirected - Tyrion, Danny, Sansa, Cersei, Arya, Jaime, Sam, Jorah and Theon; UNTIL NOW.
Jorah and Theon, two of the longest running, and in the top ten for screen time have been wiped off. They're the two largest deaths of major characters since Petyr B and good ol' Ned Stark. All other charachters have LESS screen time, meaning this episode technically has the highest death count of major charachters when based on their respective screen time.
Yes, it's rediculous that our fan favourites all survived against hordes of unead but never in an episode have I felt such fear and tension for the lives of these charachters; such a build up of they're all going to destination-F that it's actually shocking they mostly survived! The shock here is they all survived in a perilous, last-second win or they all die situation which is the staple of films like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and the MCU. Especially Endgame if you haven't seen that yet I would compare it to this episode; visually stunning and surprisingly compelling. Yet somehow most of the charachters survive.Also, Arya is freaking badass and I'm so happy she killed the Night King!",299,0,,0,No reference
765,406693,2002-03-19,badmaash9911,Bamboozled (2000),,"Bamboozled is a movie that addresses the issue of racism concerning African Americans.  From the very beginning, the raw reality of it is thrown into the faces of the audience, and they are left to deal with it on their own.  The story is centered on an aspiring writer for a major television company, who happens to be black.  Lately, the public has not been very receptive to his work.  The main reason being that the work didn't `appeal' to the African American population.  Played by Damon Wayans, Pierre, the writer, is accused of not being in touch with the black community, and this is why his work failed.  An issue of self-identity and place in society then arises.  What does it mean to be black?  Does it mean that one has to conform themselves to fit the mold of the stereotypes set forth by society? This is what Pierre hopes to abolish.  By creating a show that is the very embodiment of all black stereotypes, he hopes that the people will see the hideous prejudice, and realize their wrong.  What follow is the exact opposite.  Instead of offending and angering the majority of the public, they end up loving it.  As the plot develops, Spike Lee shows how the issue of race and ignorance affects each character and how it changes them personally.  By bringing the audience to the receiving end of racism, they are up close and personal to what it really feels to be a victim of bigotry.  Bamboozled leaves the audience bewildered, and shocked.  The intensity of this ground-shaking movie forces one to reevaluate their perceptions of themselves, and the society that they live in.",279,0,,0,No reference

767,3385030,2017-09-09,joshfedderson,It (I) (2017),10.0,"""It"" (2017) is my new favorite I just so it tonight and I had to right a review on it. I like this new version because it goes along well with the book. I like how each individual kid goes through a scary experience, and meets Pennywise individually. The story was really good and I liked how it started with Georgie going missing, it made things that more tense. The story follows the losers club and their personal experiences with ""It"" and bullies. They band together to create the losers club and form a friendship that is very close. I like how in this version they focus more on Bill, Beverly, and Ben's relationship and how their early childhood love blooms. I felt they went more in depth in this version then in the previous version explaining a lot more. What I really liked is the ending though, the ending was really great. When they all team up on Pennywise and beat the living hell out of him. Then they all make a promise in blood to return to Derry if ""It"" returns which is a major bonus that shows there will be a second part. The only downside is I was hoping they would show a cut scene at the end of the credits, but all we got is Pennywise's evil laugh. Another thing that confirms a second part is that it says part 1 at the end.This new ""It"" was a good remake. And I'm glad I went and enjoyed it the theater was packed so I knew somehow it was popular. And it was funny how people in the room jumped and screamed, I did a few times. This woman next to me literally grabbed me a few times when she got scared. I didn't mind it,and she apologized to me afterwards and I was cool with it. Her girlfriends thought it was funny. I thought it was cool. ""It"" is a good horror movie and it was better then the previous one. I still like the old one though. Can't wait till part 2! and see the kids grown up as adults. 10/10 for 2017's ""It""",360,0,,0,No reference

I'm a great one for authenticity and it was great to see actual German half tracks being used instead of the American White vehicles usually used because the film company couldn't get hold of the real mccoy. I enjoyed the film but what spoilt it for me to some degree was the fact that Deacon actually knew one of the German soldiers that the small group captured. That was stretching feasibility somewhat and spoilt for me an otherwise good story. The English Pilot wasn't played by an Englishman and it didn't take too long to suss out that the actor was an American. He just didn't sound right.

He pours scorn on their concerns.The lads decide to stage a scam; by making Quint think that a V.I.P. is due in for a minor operation, they get him to release the funds required to give St. Swithin's a full make-over...Angus Deayton brightens up this episode; his 'Quint' is reminiscent of the show's old-style 'nasties' such as 'Sir John Pollock' ( from the 'In Charge' episode 'The Merger' ) and 'Mr.Gascoigne' ( from the 'On The Go' instalment 'For Your Own Good' ). In the old days the lads would have debagged him, covered him in yellow paint or thrown him into the canal. The worst that happens to him here is that he is made to look extremely foolish.Nice to see Robin Nedwell regaining a little of his old fire, the scene where he rages at Quint is superb. Once again, George Layton the writer is at odds with George Layton the actor. There's no denying that Layton is as good here as he was in the original show, sadly he fails to give himself ( along with everybody else ) any decent lines.With N.H.S. cutbacks very much in the news in 1991 thanks to the horrendous Virginia Bottomley, the then Minister Of Health, this plot was certainly timely, even if it really belongs on 'Casualty'.Twelve million viewers tuned in for the first episode of 'At The Top', but by this one went out that figure had decreased to five.Funniest moment - Quint entering a ward expecting to see the V.I.P. - Charles Windsor - but instead of the future King he sees only a little boy with the same name!",333,0,,0,No reference

774,2682108,2014-06-22,MartinHafer,Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries (2012–2015),9.0,"My summary above is NOT meant as any sort of criticism. After all, so many shows and films are marketed towards guys and it seems more than reasonable that one should be marketed more towards women. However, in the case of ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"", I really do think the show would appeal more to ladies--though guys will also enjoy the show and should not avoid it. Why do I say this? Well, since my oldest daughter first saw the show, she's gotten EVERYONE to watch it--and my house has been filled with women who simply love the show! I hear lots of comments about Miss Fisher's wonderful clothes, the budding romances between the various characters and how nice it is to see a strong female lead who does NOT need a guy to rush in and save her. Heck, often in the shows it's Miss Fisher who saves guys and shoots the baddies! This I can really appreciate, as I have two daughters and don't want either to buy into the old fashioned notion that women are weak. Miss Fisher is anything but weak!

As for the show itself, it's a very well written and engaging murder mystery show. What I particularly like about the show is that the cases are not simple (too often in mystery films, this IS the case) and the production values are amazing. It really does look like the 1920s in the show and it does a great job in trying to get the decade correct. My only reservation is that perhaps this is not a great show for kids or even teens, as Miss Fisher has a very strong sexual appetite---and I am not sure this is the best message for kids to emulate. Sex is great...indiscriminate sex can be deadly. Still, given it's a show about murders, it isn't exactly marketed to younger audiences and parents should use common sense here. All in all, a very well made Aussie series and I am happy to hear it's been recently renewed for season 3.",341,0,,0,No reference
775,1313211,2006-10-20,christopher-208,Garçon stupide (2004),9.0,"Garcon Stupide (Stupid Boy) is an emotionally-packed punch. The film and it's lead character, Loic, had me hooked from the start. With the exception of a few slower scenes, I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. A few laughs, intense thought and emotion, and a few tears were generated from this well directed and acted film.

The filming techniques and styles, and the soundtrack selections helped me score this film. The direction and unique filming combined with some classical scores and the storyline all fit perfectly together.

The story itself follows the plight of Loic, a young handsome 20-year old who works in a chocolate factory by day, and entertains men of all ages by night for extra cash. In the film, he has a close loving friendship with a girl, Marie. He also develops a relationship of trust with a man he meets on the Internet, Lionel. The 2 never have sexual relations, just conversation about life. Something interesting to note: we never see Lionel. Or do we at the end? You decide.

The story line develops around Loic's desires to be someone - a photographer, a gay man, ...? He seems to have lost direction in life, and is unable to trust/confide in the 2 people who seem to care for him most, Marie and Lionel. When Marie finds a boyfriend, you can clearly see the upset and anger in Loic. He withdraws from Marie, and Lionel, and neither situation has a positive outcome.

In the meantime, he develops an infatuation of sorts with a local soccer player, who is successful, married and with child. Loic sees a life he wants for himself.

Although this is a French film (with English subtitles), we have young people like Loic all over America. And we have adults who take advantage of them - and we have adults, like Lionel in this film, who truly can be a trusted friend. One of my favorite lines spoken by Lionel to Loic is ""You can be interested in someone without wanting to f**k them"". This statement rings true for so many, both those near the age of 20, and those near the age of 40.

This is overall, an exceptional film - very good acting, great soundtrack, unique camera angles and film styles, wonderful story, and well-directed.",386,0,,0,No reference

When the spy is forced to abduct the Ambassador's daughter, we would expect him to be a bit more able to get rid of her. She's about ten years old and full of romantic misconceptions about spies, and treats the whole affair, at first, like a thrilling adventure. She's played by Loretta Parry (of ""Hand in Hand"" fame), an overly chatty, precocious upper class rich girl who tends to cajole or nag with speeches dotted with poetry and philosophy like an Oxford graduate. The spy is sullen and monosyllabic and German. Still, she's fascinated by him and follows him faithfully through a night of hiding in a barn, in separate stalls of course. In 1963 any sexual overtones would be unthinkable, and we would never worry that he might be a threat to her, nor do the people looking for them. About the story's spy and his dirty work? Once again, the skewed neutral-relativist politics of the series plays a hand. The spy is recalled as once spying for the British, but now he's working for the ""other side"". (In ""Espionage"", any mention of Russia, East Germany or Communism is avoided, even at the cost of story integrity.) The point being, of course, if the Brits have used him as a spy, they have no claim on moral superiority over when the, um, ""other side"" does the same thing. See, it's all equal.

779,3328120,2017-06-27,Vartiainen,Alien: Covenant (2017),6.0,"Ridley Scott once again returns to the Alien franchise, this time focusing on the events after the film Prometheus. Some years have passed and once again a spaceship full of ignorant travellers land on a planet where they really shouldn't.These prequel films have gathered their fair amount of hate from the fans of the original films. And I can understand why. They change things. Ridley Scott of course always had some idea about where the xenomorphs came from or what they really were, but it was never talked about in the originals. Because it wasn't necessary. And there was an elegance to that, which is lost in these prequels as things and mythos get thicker and thicker.And yet I do admire these newer films for undertaking the task of trying to explain, and explain in a way that would make sense, not just logically but also emotionally. And they do succeed. Granted, it's not perfect, and Prometheus especially had some pretty weird and jarring things in it, but this film largely makes up for that. After seeing it, I can see the path from Prometheus to Alien. And it makes sense, is properly horrific as is fitting for this horror franchise, and genuinely works as an overall story.That being said, it stumbles around as a movie. The first third is actually really good. The new characters are interesting, the new planet looks amazing, the horror is there, the anticipation, the tension and when the violence finally comes, it's genuinely thrilling and gory. The second third starts to go downhill. I have nothing against Michael Fassbender in these films, but as we focus on him so much, it almost seems like the xenomorphs become superfluous. And in a way they do, and that's a problem. It simply doesn't feel right when a xenomorph is a B-plot in an Alien film.The final third is much the same as the second, but the final ending is something that I have to admire. Because it's not a typical Hollywood ending. Not even a typical Alien ending in a way. And kudos for that, Ridley Scott.Alien: Covenant doesn't come close to matching the brilliance of Alien and Aliens. But it just might be the third best film in the franchise anyway. It has the vision as well as the ambition, plus beautiful visuals, good action and the best horror moments since those two. A mixed package, but ultimately worth a watch.",406,0,,0,No reference

Maia Morgenstern's performance as the Latin teacher is nuanced and subtle. To summarize it: as opposed to a lot of films which plot is desperately predictable, the viewer's anticipations while watching Veni,Vidi,Fugi are always contradicted and invalidated by a very original and complex script.",110,0,,0,No reference
784,2583348,2013-12-29,zardoz-13,47 Ronin (2013),5.0,"Ethnocentrism occurs when one culture appropriates something from another culture and then attempts to enhance it. The latest version of the legendary Genroku Akō incident, the tragic 18th century Japanese account of samurai warriors avenging their fallen leader, displays all the vestiges of ethnocentrism. Mind you, the Japanese produced six previous cinematic adaptations about their historic milestone before Hollywood tampered with it. For the record, those movies were ""The 47 Ronin"" (1941), ""Chûshingura"" (1958), ""Chushingura"" (1962), ""The Fall of Ako Castle"" (1978), ""47 Ronin"" (1994) and ""The Last Chushingura (2010). Presumably, Hollywood must have felt that this constituted an ideal opportunity to produce its own spin on this venerable story. Not surprisingly, Universal Studios has taken considerable liberties with the material. Not only has the studio embroidered this renowned tale of honor with outlandish supernatural elements, specifically demons and witchcraft, but it also has added a half-breed European supporting character to the yarn. Presumably, Universal must have felt that attracting an American audience to a $200-million plus film primarily about the Japanese would only recoup its costs if a major American actor got mixed up in it. Keanu Reeves of ""The Matrix"" trilogy appears as the improbable white guy who sets the catastrophic events of the Akō vendetta into motion as well as dictates how the Japanese can resolve their dreadful predicament. Freshman director Carl Rinsch and ""Wanted"" scenarist Chris Morgan with ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" scribe Hossein Amini have fashioned a conventional chronicle of samurai versus samurai, with a grim finale that precludes any thought of a sequel. If you know nothing about the outrageous revisions that the filmmakers have imposed on the most celebrated instance of the samurai code of honor, you will probably enjoy this scenic saga about sword and sorcery a lot more. Imagine what any important event in American history would emerge as if a Japanese individual interfered with it and you'll have a good idea about ""47 Ronin."" ""47 Ronin"" takes place in feudal Japan in the 1700s. Lord Asano (Min Tanaka of ""Black Dawn"") of the Ako province adopts a wandering teenager, Kai (Keanu Reeves), who is the son of a British sailor and a Japanese peasant. The boy's mother abandoned him, and demons raised him. Eventually Kai ran away from them and Lord Asano took him in as one of his own. Kai grew up with Asano's daughter, Mika (Kô Shibasaki of ""One Missed Call""), and the two become romantically attracted to each other. Meanwhile, since Kai is a half-breed, he cannot serve Lord Asano as a samurai. Instead, he functions as the equivalent of a scout. The first major scene shows him slaying a massive beast that resembles an enormous buffalo with tree branches for antlers. Naturally, another samurai warrior, Yasuno (Masayoshi Haneda of ""Emperor""), claims credit for the kill, but Asano's number one samurai, Ôishi (Hiroyuki Sanada of ""The Wolverine""), knows the truth. Later, Lord Asano welcomes his supreme leader, Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa of ""Mortal Combat""), to his palatial estate along with his chief rival, Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano of ""Thor: The Dark World""), from the nearby Nagato province. The villainous Kira conspires with the aid of a demonic, shape-shifting witch, (Rinko Kikuchi of ""Pacific Rim""), to drug Asano into attacking him. The witch uses a bulbous spider to deliver a drug across Asano's lips while he is asleep so that he awakens and imagines that Kira is raping his daughter. Appalled by his own behavior, Asano follows the dictates of the Shogun in committing ritual suicide. Ôishi blames himself for letting these events transpire, especially after Kai warned him about the witch. Everybody but Asano and his daughter treats Kai with utter contempt. After Asano slashes his belly open with a knife, Ôishi completes the ordeal by decapitating his master. The heartless Shogun banishes all Asano's samurai who are now designated as ronin. At the same time, Kira sells Kai into slavery where Kai becomes a highly prized combatant in arena showdowns. The Shogun commands Mika to marry Kira after mourning the death of her father for a year. Kira has Ôishi thrown into a dungeon where he spends the next year. Eventually, after he is released, the vengeance driven Ôishi assembles the remaining samurai and persuades Kai to join them as they set out to deal with the murderous Kira.Compared with other samurai sages, ""47 Ronin"" is fairly routine stuff. The battle sequences lack grandeur, and the sword play is pretty dull. The massive ritual suicide at the end isn't exactly what American audiences will enjoy. Imagine ""Star Wars"" ending with everybody eviscerating themselves at fade-out and you have a good idea what to expect. This big-budgeted spectacle also suffers from second-rate special effects. Most of the sprawling mountain backdrops are clearly computer-generated, while the swirling witch's dragon looks like something out of a Chinatown carnival. Presumably, Rinsch and his writers decided to rely on sorcery because nobody knows for certain why Asano attacked his guest in real-life. The way that Asano is poisoned is reminiscent of how the Japanese girl died at the hands of Ninjas in the James Bond movie ""You Only Live Twice."" In ""You Only Live Twice,"" a ninja hid in the rafters, dangled a thread above the heroine's mouth, and dribbled poison down it. The witch in ""47 Ronin"" behaves less spectacularly than the witch in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" that co-scripter Hossein Amini penned. The art direction, production design, and cinematography make ""47 Ronin"" look more impressive than its ersatz plot. Interestingly enough, this film didn't impress Japanese audiences, and Universal has already written it off as a financial disaster. Ultimately, ""47 Ronin"" qualifies as a tolerable movie with guts but little gusto.",954,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

788,3259835,2017-03-20,jasonmilburn-28140,Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),8.0,"I'll start by mentioning that I adore the original animation, rating it as my #1 Disney film. When I heard this was coming out, I was extremely excited. I had no idea what to expect and avoided the trailers because I wanted to keep an open mind - something that turned out to be very necessary!First I'll start with a few weaker points.The absolute killer for me was the general feel. It was nowhere near as vibrant as it should have been and I didn't feel enough contrast between the first and second halves. When I found out that the director of some Twilight films was involved, everything became very clear. At some points it just felt so grey and not very Disney-like and I truly think that poor direction held this production back. Especially some of the happier scenes in the castle - I was sitting thinking 'Jesus, isn't the saturation a little bit off'. I know it's supposed to be gloomy, but isn't the whole film really about finding beauty in unlikely places? That being said, the scene where Belle is racing through the gardens after being released was stunning.Secondly the portrayal of a gay man for comic relief was distasteful and a little insulting. Props to Disney for having the guts to include this, however I can't help feeling that it was more for publicity than anything else. The whole thing with that musketeer being dressed as a woman was completely stupid and shortsighted; the same ridiculous clichè that the community tries so hard to cast off. If you're going to include a gay character, make it a full part of a story and not just comic relief or a fleeting scene obviously added to tick boxes. It was all quite irrelevant to be honest.Lastly with the negatives - I didn't completely love the effects. I thought the cartoony feel was charming and not something I expected. Personally I felt this worked well - although the town felt more charming than anything else and I felt myself asking Belle, 'is it really that awful?'. On the other hand, it somewhat seemed a half-done job; halfway between an animation and live-play. The enchanted objects in the castle had really strange faces that didn't convey the comforting characters they're supposed to be but their bodies (for lack of a better word) were rather well animated. The Beast was a bit strange to look at too and felt half-baked. There was without a doubt, room for improvement there. The castle, however; was breathtaking and did the animated version the justice it deserved.An area which I'm quite undecided on is Emma Watson as Belle. I adore her as an actress; I think she has some real talent but I can't work out whether she was right for the role. On one side she conveys the small-town girl role who wants adventure very well. Her inquisitive side is very believable and it's very clear she doesn't fit in. On the other side i don't really think she has the warmth of the original Belle; it was as if she cared more about rebelling and staying in the castle than about her feelings for the Beast. This is NOT a criticism of her acting at all - what she did, she did well despite the poor direction. I just believe there could have been a better fit.Acting-wise the standout roles were probably Gaston and Lumiere's voice acting. They really carried the film in my opinion; Gaston was definitely more comedic than the original but this was a welcome addition. Lumiere was the perfect host and despite the questionable animation, was still the same charming character as before. I don't think any of the acting was particularly weak - still room for more believability but I blame the silly choice of directors - why choose the director of a cheap, wooden, gloomy series about vampires and werewolves for a vibrant Disney epic?The film stays true to its roots and whilst it doesn't add much, what it did add worked really well. For example the book which took Belle back to Paris was something that really built upon her character, even if it was a little bit far-fetched. It answered some questions which were left unanswered before. Something I really missed was the Beast's roar as Belle ran from the castle after letting her free. It's small, I know, but was incredibly powerful in the original. They could have saved themselves the effort of writing that extra song and portrayed the same pain.Overall a good adaptation which somehow kept the charm of the original despite being held-back by poor choice of directors. Lots of room for improvement but certainly not a waste of time or money. Please also ignore these family-friendly negative comments. The 'gay' scene (it feels like a total joke even calling it this) lasted for probably not even a second and should have been cut anyway as it was totally pointless. Like I said, if you're going to include inclusive relationships, don't force it into a classic and do it properly! If girls were discouraged from reading and learning, I'd hardly expect anyone to be open- minded enough to accept a same-sex relationship.",871,0,,0,No reference

790,1901305,2009-12-20,ttapola,"Baywatch: Guys & Dolls (1994) Season 4, Episode 22",3.0,"I've reviewed a couple of Baywatch episodes because the re-runs ""ambushed"" me and I felt that it was my responsibility for the sake of humanity to warn people of what kind of garbage they were. This, however, is the first time I intentionally watched a re-run. There really was nothing else on TV and I had nothing else to so. Besides, there is some sense of achievement and also pleasure in thrashing a Baywatch episode, even if it is like shooting fish in a barrel.Prologue: Someone packs and ships a doll from Hong Kong to Malibu. It'll probably have some relevance later. Oh, what a teaser, how *will* I survive until the doll's importance is revealed? Then, Matt saves a girl, Nancy, from drowning. She's a waitress who's having an audition to become an actress. But oh no, she lost her money in the water! So the gullible Matt lends her $100 because he ""can recognize a talent"". Summer no like this.Meanwhile, the world's most blind tractor driver in the world is smoothing the sand on the beach or something, and Mitch is the only person who can see that he's about to run over a man. Naturally, Mitch *just* manages to save him in the last second. Cliché alert! But it gets ""better"": the man, Henry, says he's looking for his daughter because he's dying. And the daughter in his photo just happens to be the girl Matt saved. Except that Henry claims her name is Rachel.At this point the show went into a commercial break, so I have time to state that I came to like A.J. Langer in Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs, which is, given the current boom at the time of writing, due for a remake like all horror movies of the 1980s. Anyway, it is a shame she never quite made it in the harsh market that is Hollywood.Now back to the episode. I was already wondering where the stupid montages were when we were subjected to a sugar-coated montage of Stephanie and what's-his-name having a nice time. Bleurgh! Matt doesn't hear from the girl (or the money - Summer no like that either!), but Mitch introduces the girl's father to him. So, the girl is after a yacht coming from Hong Kong and his father goes on the look after her. But, in an amazing coincidence, Matt runs into her! The girl bolts, but Matt catches her. She tells her she missed the audition and also got fired from her job and Matt buys this hook, line and sinker. How stupid is that guy? When Matt tells about Nancy's father, the girl tells that he is a maniac who beats her. *This* Matt for some reason doesn't buy. It's like if he's flipping a coin when making decisions. Again, the girl promises to bring Matt her money the following day and he buys it.And, as if we weren't nauseated enough by the first montage, we then have a montage of people playing American football on the beach. This has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the episode. Which does not surprise anyone.Stephanie confronts Mitch with the subject of whether there are any feelings between them. When Mitch only wants to be her friend, she decides to take Scott's-his-name seriously.Nancy comes to ask Matt for help to get the package that came on the yacht from Hong Kong. Matt agrees on the condition that after they have fetched the package, Nancy will meet her father.Speaking about Nancy's father, he just coincidentally happens to arrive at Mitch's tower just as Summer tells Mitch where she saw Nancy. Another nice coincidence! The man then intrudes on Matt's boat and puts him and Nancy, now called Linda, at gunpoint. Linda calls the man Sam. They are con artists! What a shocker! Let's go to a commercial! I'll stop with the plot descriptions now as enough material has already been described and I can assure you it does not get any better in the last act. As any Baywatch viewer knows, the acting is flat, the dialog is grating, the cinematography uninspired and the direction barely adequate. I can recommend this episode only if you liked A.J. Langer, but it will still destroy some of your brain cells. Which, now that I think about it, was probably the intent of the makers of Baywatch from the start - after the novelty of gratuitous slow-motion montages wore of, most of the core audience had lost enough braincells to become mindless zombies watching Baywatch purely on instinctual basis.Montages in this episode: two (2). What has happened to Baywatch? There used to be like half a dozen of them! Also, no Pammy at all! Also, no Jeremy Jackson or Gregory Alan Williams, but who notices?",798,0,,0,No reference

While the movie deals with situation after situation that the 'Tramp's' get themselves involved in, the majority of the movie takes place on the boat ride. It is here where Chaplin uses some early fantasy camera work to make the boat ride less enjoyable than it really is. Back and forth Chaplin sways the camera from left to right, making the boat look like it is being rocked back and forth by the ocean waves. A nice little comedy with a minor blooper in the background. In the start of the movie when Chaplin is trying to start the car, if you look behind in the open street you will see a man walking down the sidewalk toward the car. He stops half way when he sees that there is a camera and that they are shooting a movie. He quickly stops and turns around to walk out of the shot.

Writer/director Wayne Kramer has achieved something remarkable here--a love story within a love story: an unlikely romance between a professional loser and an aging cocktail waitress cast against an almost reverent paean to the old Las Vegas, when Frank, Deano, and Sammy reigned supreme and there wasn't a pirate ship or roller coaster to be found. Kramer also brings out some amazing performances, especially by Alec Baldwin as Shelly Kaplow, arguably his finest performance ever, and easily his best since 'Glengarry Glen Ross' or 'Malice.' The plot itself hinges on an old, all but forgotten Vegas tradition: William H. Macy is Bernie, a professional 'cooler'--a guy whose luck is so bad it's contagious, and who is paid to sidle up to any table where a gambler is on a run of luck and cool the action with his mere presence. The film's opening scene has an almost surreal quality, as hang-dog Bernie paces the floor, magically passing his bad luck with nothing more than a subtle touch of green felt or brass.Bernie works at the Golden Shangri-La, a bastion of Vegas traditionalism managed by Shelley Kaplow (Alec Baldwin), who runs his casino with religious fidelity to the old ways, idealizing the Rat Pack-era Vegas, the days before Sin City became, in Shelley's words, a ""Disneyland mookfest."" But Shelley is under pressure: longtime club headliner Buddy Stafford (Paul Sorvino) is way past his prime and carries a dark secret. The casino's investors have grown reluctant to hold on to the old ways at the expense of the record-breaking revenues being brought in by the newer, flashier, family-friendly casinos, and Shelley finds himself in a power struggle with Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston), a Harvard-educated wunderkind brought in to revitalize the struggling Shangri-La. Last but not least of Shelley's troubles is that Bernie the Cooler has announced his intention to leave town. Shelley has owned Bernie for years (Bernie's crippled shuffle is a souvenir from his days of gambling addiction administered by Shelley for non-payment of a massive debt), but Bernie is now in the clear and wants to put Vegas behind him.But Bernie finds himself reconsidering after he falls into bed with Natalie (Maria Bello), a failed showgirl-turned-cocktail waitress who propositions Bernie after he notices her being groped by a gambler on a hot streak and promptly cools the offending customer's luck. Unfortunately, Bernie's first dose of good luck in ages comes with a particular liability: having unexpectedly found happiness, Bernie finds his talent for passing on bad luck has reversed itself--to the chagrin of Shelley Kaplow.William H. Macy has long been respected has a character actor, and it's a treat to see him bring his talents to a rare lead role for a middle-aged actor of average appearance. His Bernie is truly pathetic, and yet his charm and growing confidence make his affair with Natalie believable and inspiring. Bernie is a loser, but he has courage and character, especially when confronted with his failure as a father when his dead-beat hustler son (Shawn Hatosy) appears with a pregnant, coke-snorting girlfriend (Estella Warren) in tow. Maria Bello gives an astonishing, award-worthy performance as Natalie. It's just a mystery to me that she is not a major star. She is stunningly beautiful but also persuasively real, and her moments of honesty and vulnerability in this film stick with you. Natalie is not without considerable flaws, but her love for Bernie is absolutely believable, and I found myself feeling deeply invested in them.Much of the small buzz around this film was generated by Macy and Bello's sex scenes, which are genuinely remarkable--visceral and explicit without seeming the least bit pornographic or gratuitous. This is attributable to the investment of the actors in their characters and their craft. The ardor feels totally genuine. Bello and Macy look not like actors playing roles, but like two people in love, going at it like they're never going to get another chance.But inasmuch as Bernie and Natalie are the clear hero and heroine, in certain respects, the film belongs to Alec Baldwin's Shelley. Baldwin hasn't had such a plum role in ages: Shelley is both a malicious sociopath and a tender, affectionate father figure. His loyalty to the old-school ways and his refusal to accept that Sinatra's Vegas is gone forever is genuinely tragic. Baldwin owns some of the film's finest moments: a rip-roaring tirade against the crassly commercialized Vegas embodied by his younger rival; a surprisingly tender moment with the aging crooner Buddy Stafford, where Shelley appears in Buddy's dressing room and tries to stroke the singer's flagging ego by presenting him a pair of panties he claims to have found hanging on the door-handle outside, only to have the harrowingly tragic Buddy point out that he knows Shelley bought the panties in the casino's lingerie shop, along with the services of the 'groupie' who'll be arriving shortly after Shelley leaves; a drunken catharsis after a confrontation with Bernie over Natalie that ends with Shelley smashing the architectural model of the new Shangri-La Larry plans to build, complete with shopping mall, food court, and roller-coasters.Perhaps the strongest statement of the film comes as the credits roll: a montage of video featuring the demolition of four legendary old-school casinos--the Aladdin, the Landmark, the Dunes, and the Sands, which, of course, was the Vegas home of Sinatra and the Rat Pack. It's a haunting lament at the end of a surprisingly fine film.",928,0,,0,No reference

802,1609376,2008-03-20,MaxBorg89,"Grey's Anatomy: No Man's Land (2005) Season 1, Episode 4",8.0,"Of all the characters introduced in the Grey's Anatomy pilot, model-turned-doctor Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) looked like the one with the poorest dramatic construction (aside from Alex Karev, but textbook jerks can afford to be a little shallowly developed at first): naive, blonde and sickeningly optimistic, she wouldn't have lasted very long. Fortunately, the fourth episode digs a little deeper into her psychology, and permits Heigl to build the foundations of one of the show's most rounded, compelling performances (as the Emmy for her work in Season Three confirms).Right at the start, she is shown in a more three-dimensional light than usual, as she playfully embarrasses George by using the bathroom while he is in the shower. This adds to his frustration and makes him exclaim: ""I'm not your sister!"", although the real irritation will come at work: Izzie's last modeling job is published, prompting Alex to make her the laughing stock of the entire hospital. In addition, a patient recognizes her from a magazine photo and consequently refuses to be treated by her. As for the other more interesting intern, Cristina experiences a bad day of her own when she is forced to take care of a former nurse instead of helping Dr. Shepherd remove a set of nails from a guy's head (yep, you read correctly: nails in the head).That Cristina is the most fully rounded of the characters was obvious from the pilot episode (however, George and Derek are more fun to watch), while everyone else starts developing a realistic personality as the seasons pass. The briefest and most successful evolution is Izzie's, a transformation that reaches its peak when she tells off her judgmental patient and argues to perfection that a few shots of her in sexy lingerie do not necessarily reduce her medical skills. The anger and true humanity shown by Heigl in that scene are astounding, even touching, to the point that she gets away with another tough scene (the now infamous locker-room strip) without once looking ridiculous.With such gifted supporting players, the series can justify the overall daftness of its protagonist. This concession doesn't apply to other shows, though: can you imagine The Sopranos with Tony being the least compelling character?",368,0,,0,No reference

When spoofing, it helps when audience knows what's being made fun of. Most of the negative reviews/haters of this show seem to be white people or other races. This show really makes sense if you know black culture. Even if you don't know black culture, it's STILL HILARIOUS! Family guy is great, but it doesn't make me laugh as hard as Cleveland show or Roger from American dad. Roger smith is the funniest Seth Macfarlane animation. Family guy is the best overall Seth macfarlane show, but Cleveland Show is THE FUNNIEST MACFARLANE SHOW! By far! Some say the red neck is dumb! DUH! He's dumb! Some fool said The show is offensive?! HOW?! Family guy makes fun of Jews all the time. How is this show offensive? And how is that new as all Seth Macfarlane cartoons are crude and offensive?! Weak minds give this show bad reviews. The Lead character is voiced by A WHITE MAN! I'm Half Black! If I were weak minded and sensitive like most of the negative reviewers, I'd be offended by that, BUT I'M NOT DUMB! I also understand Comedy! If it makes me laugh, it's okay! I saw a family guy clip of an Asian female driver cutting across 5 lanes and all cars exploded and crashed. It was hilarious because my mom is half Chinese and she really can't drive! Again, if you have basic common sense and your brain works and can comprehend what's being spoofed, you will LAUGH VERY HARD at this show. But I loathe when weak minded fools ruin things because their small minds can't expand enough to grasp a concept that's presented so greatly. This show is Very accurate to southerners(I'm also from the south) and black people. Maybe I connect because of those aspects, but I don't think you have to be black or from the south to understand this show. To all the weak minded, uptight fools bashing this show, watch the re runs on adult swim or internet and realize how wrong you are. And stop being so uptight and learn to laugh. I suppose many haters of this show laugh very hard at Stale stuff like The office and arrested development, but they get confused by REAL comedy! I don't think this review contains any specific details, so no spoilers. It's a great show. Every episode makes me laugh. Not every family guy or American dad episode makes me laugh. Maybe I'm more reacting to Cleveland show than the other shows, maybe it's actually funnier than the other Macfarlane shows. Open your small minds. Learn something.

But - the women characters they portray are different to the male Laurel and Hardy. The women characters are not Laurel and Hardy ""in drag"". They really are playing 4 different people.

The dubbing of the women's voices is perfect, in my opinion. The women who dubbed the voices really capture the feeling of Laurel and Hardy. They are great. The syncronicity of the dubbing is awesome.

I also think the photography - scenes when the four characters are having dinner together - is great. They really create the illusion of four separate people talking and bickering.

A man at 50 years of age, still dancing effortlessly and with more charisma than any of his well-trained backup dancers and still singing in tune is something special to watch. After 5-10 minutes into the movie you just become sucked into this outsider's view of this man's world. He spoke very little, but when he did speak, you heard him loud and clear.There's no doubt that Michael Jackson was an odd bird, but he was a true music genius. He knows everything there is to know about his music and what he wants. His vision is so clear to him and completely effortless. There are moments when he's dancing and it's as if he can do all of this in his sleep.I was completely fascinated by him and earned a greater respect for him as an artist and as a person.This movie was very tastefully done by Kenny Ortega. You can tell it was edited by someone who loved and respected Michael Jackson. The movie is about celebrating MJ and what he would have continued to bring to the table as an entertainer had he been given the chance. However, thanks to Ortega and all those involved, we still get a chance to see what he was made of and it is a reminder that Michael Jackson is indeed still the King of Pop and he still had that ""It"" factor even up until the day of his death.Whether you are a MJ fan or not, this movie will move you and you can't help but walk away with respect and appreciation for what is now lost.

Because at that time, nobody was already thinking of a second sequel. This should account for the duration of 6 long years between the second and third movie.Because every now and then, there are small hints that this funny series is running on empty. As mentioned above: it took a long time to greenlight this movie and come up with enough material to make it worth the while. Chris Tucker has grown fatter but fortunately for everyone involved he is still hysterical. This third movie still has many jokes to tell but not all of them work out as well as they should. On the other hand: there is Jackie Chan who is still incredibly agile and lightning fast doing the craziest moves imaginable. He actually manages to hide himself entirely into a flag on a pole from the bad guys in this movie. Sometimes it feels as though there are long pauses in between two action sequences, but once the action kicks off - it is always very entertaining to watch!In order to keep this movie from becoming a drag, they altered the setting once more. This time the duo find themselves in Paris, investigating one of the biggest crime syndicates in the world. This once again leads to fairly new and pleasant situations; each one funnier than the next. One of those new ideas is to mould a French taxi driver into the story and this particular character has its moments ... even though, at times, he seems more like a blunt copy of the main character in the 1998-French action movie ""Taxi"". Still: he is never really any boring and that's a good thing.Thus, Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan do what they do best and we love them for that! As always: the cast is very colorful. Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada plays the part of Kenji. Swedish actor Max von Sydow, best known for his role as the priest in the classic horror movie ""The exorcist"", stars as Varden Reynard. There's also a Japanese actress by the name of Youki Kudoh playing the mysterious figure of the Dragon Lady. Of course: there's a French woman involved as well. Noémie Lenoir plays the role of Genevieve. A famous Chinese actress named Jingchu Zhang does the role of Soo Yung; the little girl featured in the first film too. And compelling actor Tzi Ma returns as ambassador Han. On a more comical side note: be sure to watch out for Polish director Roman Polanski (famous for such classics as ""Chinatown"" and ""The pianist"") who takes place in front of the camera rather than behind it. He stars as French detective Revi. Truth be told: I hadn't even recognized him until after the movie.In short: ""Rush hour 3"" is a very entertaining movie but I think the series should end here.

Right from the start he comes off as very sure of himself, playing the macho man who knows he can have any woman, places his arms around her, holds her hand and they haven't known each other for an hour. The film is so smooth though someone may miss the signs. We see them having fun, we see him playing tricks on her, buying her expensive gifts, playing with her like a little child, chasing after some children all smiles and joy. We also see them having fun in the bedroom where he always takes the lead. But at moments, there are scenes in which we see him get mad at her when she doesn't follow his orders like she always did and throw or hit things. He doesn't stop even when she's crying and afraid of him. He only tries to wipe the incidents out of her memory by kissing her and having sex with her. No apology, no talk over the matter, no self-examination in order to become a better man.That is because he simply does not care about what she wants. This is a game to him. He finds vulnerable women looking for a thrill, he manipulates them with his charming ways, gifts and money and then he asks them to do things they perhaps would have never done if it were not for him. When they do not comply, he loses control and shows his bad side. It is easy for someone to fall for his good looks, soft voice and great sense of style and the film does exactly that: it puts you in Kim Basinger's shoes. You fall in love with John (Mickey Rourke) like she did, so you do understand why she hasn't left yet or why it took her so long to leave him but you also feel the heartache she experiences when he doesn't show up like she asked him to -do something for her for a change. It is easy to judge her character in this film or any real woman over their decision not to leave a toxic or abusive person, but the truth is, every human being doesn't want to believe their partner does not love them. We try to find excuses to justify their mistakes, we hope they will change over time, we tell ourselves the good times are more than the bad ones and we've become so emotionally attached we can't just throw it all away for a couple of flaws.

Unlike Ultraman, Ultraseven can make himself, giant, normal, or miniature in size.

This is Atlantic City at the turn of the 80s, a poor man's Vegas for some, a forgotten Mecca for gangsters during the Prohibition, a town past its glorious days and whose inhabitants, for the most of them, can find contentment in cherishing that very past because they simply have nowhere else to go, nothing else to dream of.There are two central protagonists in Louis Malle's ""Atlantic City"", three decades separate them and with that difference two totally different views of life. Sally (Susan Sarandon) is in her mid-thirties and dreams of being the first female croupier in Monte-Carlo, she's learning the ropes of the job while working as a seafood waitress, Atlantic City is a mean to an end and never would she consider spending her life in that ghost of a town. And Lou (Burt Lancaster) is a man in his late sixties, one we learn used to be a big shot in the old days, frequenting such illustrious names as Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel, a man past his prime who can only mourn his youthful days.Things aren't as schematic as they seem, Sally is obviously looking forward to a better future but Lou isn't much turned toward the past from my reading of the opening sequence. The scene is so sensually and smoothly handled that there's more than sheer voyeurism in it, Lou watches with stunned yes the beautiful Sally opening her shirt, cutting lemons and cleaning her arms with each halves, it looks like some ritual but the explanation is rather trivial, she's only getting rid of the clam smell. But it doesn't matter, it's all in the expression in Lou's face, something is fascinating him in this woman and somewhat his gazing is indirectly turned to the present she represents.Lou, as it happens, is in a relationship with Grace (Kate Reid), an old bed-ridden woman who came to the city in the 40s for a Betty Grable lookalike contest, and got stuck there. It's very telling when even the star that changed your life is rather unknown at the time being, and looking at the furniture of Kate's apartment, all full of picturesque bibelots, she's a woman who's rooted in the to the point of becoming its own past relics, broken down ornamental, but still there. Lou and Kate form a rather unconventional couple, she berates him, belittles his manhood and yet both seem to need each other for a reason: they each represent the other's past, they're their own existential landmark.Lou and Kate are neighbors to Sally and all live in a building waiting for demolition, they're all in suspended sentences fully aware of the collapse of their living, only Sally nurture hopes while Kate is resigned and Lou seems to desperately hang on any occasion to prove his value, a final one at least. That opportunity comes with a rather bizarre sight (but plausible in the film's context), a man and a pregnant woman, dressed like immigrants who'd just embarked on Ellis Island come to visit Sally. The man (Robert Joy) happens to be her husband and he's impregnated her own sister Chrissie (Hollis McLaren). Chrissie is a flower-child who believes in Karma and reincarnation and seems to live in the same bubble of peaceful naivety than Kate, no wonder that the two women get along togetherThe brother, however, had other goals in mind, involving a heroin sample he stole in Philadelphia, which he's planning to sell... for dramatic results. The turn of events all leads up to Lou handling the drug deals and getting more and more money, enough to buy a brand new suit, to seduce Sally, passing as a man of the same caliber than those he used to serve, until he encounters the killers who came to get their stuff back. I stop here because the plot, not intricate or complex but captivating in its linear format, is instrumental to the evolution of characters. The drug plot doesn't matter to the degree that it works as a social leverage for a man, Burt Lancaster in his best role, and a gateway for Sally. How it works is all handled by Louis Malle's distant and detached directing.There's no fancy narrative in the film, no particular use of music, except for a fine cameo by Robert Goulet. What John Guare's screenplay accomplishes is simply to tell a story of a city from the perspective of people who want to escape from it, a woman who wants to find a true future and not just be pampered or pimped by a suave manager (Michael Piccoli) and a man who's constantly reminded by his girlfriend that he's a nobody who can only brag about approaching legendary men, if sharing an elevator can ever be called approaching. The end of the film gives a deep and emotionally satisfying feeling of closure to what can be considered a fascinating character study served by two tremendous and nuanced performances.And Atlantic City, the city itself, belongs to that breed of places that are so peculiar that they offer a unique operation theatre for protagonists no matter how ordinary and harmless they are. I don't think there could ever be another masterpiece set in Atlantic City just like there could never be a movie like ""In Bruges"": the town, with its particular texture and old-fashioned charm, insufflates its spirit to the protagonists and gives an existential weight to their most benign actions while attenuating what could be spectacular but cheap plot tricks.To put it simply, set elsewhere, the film, Best Picture nominee of 1981, would have lost half of its impact, but Malle proved two things: if you get the right casting, half the movie works and if you get the right setting, the other half works all the same.",988,0,,0,No reference
826,3355776,2017-08-01,kaptenvideo-89875,Back to Burgundy (2017),7.0,"Making wine and drama. Jean (Pio Marmaï) left his family home ten years ago. When father falls ill, he returns and reunites with his sister Juliette (Ana Girardot) and brother Jérémie (François Civil), to sort out stuff between them. Ah families. Their problems and conflicts seem very important for themselves, but are often difficult to understand for bystanders. This is also true for writer-director Cédric Klapisch's latest, slow-burning but quite nice drama about the importance of family and the power of forgiving. The short summary feels sugary, and Klapisch does aim for feel-good, but the movie does not try to manipulate with audience in any tasteless way. It is actually realistic depiction of well-behaved and intelligent family's life, where everybody has their problems but these are not solved in overtly dramatic way often expected from family sagas. This subtle approach doesn't make for very engaging drama, but the feel-good factor is important part of the movie. If you care to invest yourself in these characters' lives, you will probably feel like a part of their group in their end. Which is the best thing this kind of movie can ask for. One can also learn quite a lot about making and appreciating wine. 113 minutes makes it rather long watch, it's not a standout work but quietly confident and satisfying. I don't like international and also Estonian title Back to Burgundy"" (Tagasi Burgundiasse"") which is not as eloquent as the original – directly translated What Links Us"" (Mis meid seob"").

829,1632594,2008-05-06,Witchfinder-General-666,Blood Orgy of the She-Devils (1973),3.0,"""Blood Orgy Of The She Devils"" - an awesome title, that raises hopes for an ultra-sleazy and gory 70s Explotitation effort full of gratuitous female nudity, chopped off limbs etc. Unfortunately Ted V. Mikels' film, which is nonetheless slightly entertaining for its trashiness, is a very tame, and often boring yawner, that does not nearly come up to what the title promises. As it often was the case with films with an extremely low budget, this was given a title that has little to nothing to do with the actual film in order to lure viewers into theaters. The film itself is an absolutely ridiculous mess, but even though often too boring, it has its amusing moments. The film has a ridiculous and confused plot dealing with witchcraft, which revolves around an occult voodoo circle lead by a witch named Mara. Mara has supernatural powers which she can use to communicate with the dead as well as for other black magic purposes. When she includes a pretty young woman in her unholy circle, the girl's boyfriend and best friend consider a doctor who is an expert for the occult. The doctor, basically the hero of the film, is constantly talking in 'sophisticated' nonsensical phrases about witchcraft. The performances are terrible, but terrible performances are something I can forgive in low-budget cinema. What I missed were the exploitative factors, namely the expected gore and sleaze. The popularity of Michael Reeves' British Horror masterpiece ""Witchfinder General"" starring the great Vincent Price spawned a number of violent 'Hexploitation' films about witch-hunts, most prominently the notorious (and great) ""Mark Of The Devil"". Director Mikels also tried to jump on the bandwagon here, and ""Blood Orgy Of The She-Devils"" therefore includes two flashbacks to the time of witch-hunts, which are incredibly corny, but probably even so the best scenes in the film. Mikels is probably best known for ""The Corpse Grinders"" of 1972, which has a certain cult status, and which I have yet to see. ""Blood Orgy Of The She Devils"" is certainly not the nasty Exploitation film the title suggests, but merely a quite tame, and very very silly little film that mildly amuses but bores even more. It somehow reminded me of ""Snake People"", an extremely odd low budget-production which happened to be one of the last films starring the great Horror icon Boris Karloff. The difference is that this one doesn't star Karloff. ""Blood Orgy Of The She Devils"" has its amusing moments, and fans of (awful) cult cinema can consider watching it. Others should avoid it. I personally don't regret watching it, as I was somehow entertained by it, however, I made sure to write this review the day after watching it, since I will probably have forgotten it entirely in a week.",463,0,,0,No reference

843,1529818,2007-10-23,TOMASBBloodhound,Creepshow (1982),9.0,"Movies based on Stephen King writings are pretty hit and miss. This collection of five short horror tales absolutely hits the mark. Many of King's celluloid failures can be attributed to poor direction and casting. With Creepshow, we have a skilled director (Romero) and a wonderfully layered cast of older and up-and-coming actors. The film is intended to look like a comic book in terms of angles and lighting, but it doesn't go over the top like say, Dick Tracy from 1990. The film is genuinely frightening, suspenseful, funny, and gory when it needs to be. The film begins and ends with the story of an abusive father and the revenge taken by his son after the father throws out his comic book containing these five stories. The stories are all somewhat different in tone and structure, but they are all at least somewhat effective.The first story entitled ""Father's Day"" is kind of on the goofy side. There really isn't a whole lot to it, and it kind of serves as a warm-up act. The focus of the story is a deceased patriarch rising from his grave and demanding the cake he was denied when he was murdered by his daughter on Father's Day. Look out for a young Ed Harris who gets crushed by an enormous headstone. There are some scares in this one, but it's more silly than anything else.Stephen King is the star of the next story entitled ""The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill"". In it, he plays a hillbilly who comes in contact with a meteorite that lands on his property. After touching it with his bare hands and burning his fingers, he attempts to cool it off with a bucket of water. The results are somewhat funny, and nothing is particularly frightening about this story. King is a hoot, but the way he eventually dies is actually kind of depressing. Poor guy! The third story entitled ""Something to Tide You Over"" is one of the best. Leslie Neilson plays a sadistic rich man out to torment his wife and her lover (a young Ted Danson) by burying them up to their necks on the beach while the tide comes in over them. Even though Neilson is playing a dirty SOB, you can see the lighthearted side of him just dying to come out. It's really a pretty neat story, though rather predictable. The ending is decidedly unsettling.""The Crate"" is next, and it's a long one compared to the others. The terrific cast including Hal Holbrook, Fritz Weaver, and Adrienne Barbeau are very good, but this one needed some tightening. The payoffs are quick and gory, but it takes maybe too long to get to the conclusion. This episode has some very tense moments, as well as some very funny ones.Finally, we have ""They're Creeping Up On You"". This one is perhaps my favorite. It has E. G. Marshall playing a Howard Hughes type germophobe living in a supposedly germ-proof penthouse. Trouble is, there seems to be a cockroach scurrying across the floor or counter in every scene. We get a sense for just what a creep this man is by hearing him conduct business over the phone and make various demands of those who work for him. He is a really foul-mouthed chap whose world comes crashing down once the power goes out in his building. The final scene is absolutely disgusting and has to hold some kind of record for most roaches ever on one set. This segment is quick, funny, and very creepy.The work as a whole is worth at least 9 of 10 stars. Don't miss it! The Hound.",607,0,,0,No reference
844,3138411,2016-08-31,MartinHafer,The Sleeping Tiger (1954),4.0,"""The Sleeping Tiger"" is a film so flawed by its premise that no matter how good the picture is, it is automatically cursed to be second- rate. Think about it...a thug with a gun breaks into a psychiatrist's home and the doctor then invites the criminal to live in his home! The only way this MIGHT have worked had they made there a latent homosexual undertone to all this. But there wasn't and the film often makes no sense at all!

Dirk Bogarde plays the crook, Frank, and he plays him very well. This is no surprise, as Bogarde played many sociopathic creeks and played them well during this era. He does his best with the material. As for Alexis Smith, her character as the Doc's wife is terrible--and clichéd. And, the husband, played by Alexander Knox, is the worst of all...a man who makes himself a virtual eunuch in his own home!

The bottom line is that while the film has its moments, the plot is simply hopeless and a couple dumb characters make it all the worse. You could do a lot better and I'd recommend you try some of Bogarde's better written sociopath films such as ""Cast a Dark Shadow"".",203,0,,0,No reference

From the moment we meet Buck, his looks and mannerisms reflect the humanization of the dog. Being a dog owner, I really disliked this. Reading into a dog's eyes and looks to reflect our human emotions is a fantasy I don't particularly like.Basically, the story goes that Buck is stolen from his owner Judge Miller (Bradley Whitford), in Santa Clara, CA. While with the Judge, Buck had the run of Miller's home, and the opening scenes we see him eating whatever food he can find, and then he ruins a whole table full of food, by sampling or eating more food than a dog, of that size, could ever eat.Now stolen from his home, Buck is shipped to Alaska and meets John Thornton (Harrison Ford), who is grumpy but sees something in Buck he likes and gives a wry smile.Buck is purchased by the mail delivery team of Perrault (Omar Sy) and Francoise (Cara Lee). Although Buck is a huge dog, he's out of his element because Perrault and Francoise are dog sled mail delivery workers, and Buck has never been a working dog and knows nothing about snow or being a sled pulling dog. He's been a home dog.Buck is mystified by the snow and then becomes demoralized after being hooked up to a harness and asked to pull a sled led by other computer-animated dogs. He does his best but, in a human way, makes mistakes.But CGI Buck decides to become the best dog in the team, which comes across as another human aspect. The lead dog appreciates Bucks's efforts (more human emotions), but the entire movie audience knows what is coming, a confrontation with the lead husky.This confrontation ultimately ends up in glory for Buck, Perrault, and Francois, but as the story would have it, Buck gets sold again to a greedy miner Hal (Dan Stevens) who wants to find gold. He and Thorton get into it, and bad blood arises over Hal's treatment of Buck.Buck escapes Hal, finds Thornton, and they walk together into the wilderness, the call of the wild sort of speak.Together they create an excellent partnership. Upon arriving at a remote cabin, they set up shop, and Buck starts to flirt with and hang out with timberwolves. Of course, there is one final predictable confrontation with Hal, and we all know what will happen.There are lovely and poignant moments, and they mostly revolve around Thornton's grumpy demeanor and Buck's loving, caring way.Not being able to forget just how humanized Buck was made to be, the film's real story about self-redemption and following your dream, was left on the cutting room floor.Ford was terrific as John Thornton, a man who was still mourning the loss of his son. Sy was great and engaging as Perrault, the sled driver. Gee was excellent as Perrault's co-sled team driver. Michael Green wrote this screenplay. There wasn't anything wrong with the screenplay, but the execution of the CGI dog just failed the film. Chris Sanders did a reasonable job of directing this story, but the CGI hurt the effort, and Sanders is part to blame because he allowed too much humanization of Buck.Overall: This was a difficult film to watch because it seemed too made up.",580,0,,0,No reference

Supposedly the director's cut is better, but tbh I can't really imagine it improving this pile of over-cgi'd tosh much, and certainly not enough to warrant me wasting another couple of hours.Way too long was spent pointlessly building up Daredevil, and then his relationship with Elektra - you still didn't feel any kind of bond or empathy for them so the first hour or so was a complete waste of time. They went to all the bother of building up Daredevil's relationship with Elektra (or at least trying to, the acting was soo wooden he might as well have been having a relationship with his cane), only to summarily kill her after a particularly lame scene where she tries to kill Daredevil after wrongfully thinking he assassinated her father, only to remove his mask, realize it's her boyfriend and then suddenly go all 'Woops! Ooh, I'm so sorry!'. A far more likely reaction would be 'You bar steward! You only slept with me to get close to my father! Here, take this sai through the throat!'. But even given that, it was still disappointing they didn't have a few minutes as a 'crimefighting duo' where they kicked some bad guy butt before she was killed.And it then went on to a similarly disappointing fight with Kingpin. Oh, I blinked. Is it over? Oh well, there goes two hours of my life down the toilet.But even given all that, I would probably still have given it three stars (there are much worse movies out there, like Battleship), but it loses an extra star for spawning the worst spin off ever made - Elektra.

In a way I could relate to the couple stranded in the middle of the ocean; I went out once on a snorkeling excursion in the Bahamas, and the thought crossed my mind - what if the driver of the boat just decided to leave? The thought by itself isn't all that scary, but every time a shark swam by in this movie it was difficult not to tense up and wonder what was going to happen next. The reality of the film didn't really sink in until Susan (Blanchard Ryan) cast away the corpse of her boyfriend (Daniel Travis), and shortly after decided that her situation was beyond hopeless. I was actually disappointed that she didn't have the courage to hang on for some type of miracle to occur, like one of the rescue boats or planes locating her in that impossible expanse of ocean water.I think the 'based on a true story' aspect of this film only goes so far, virtually everything we observe after the couple is left behind is entirely speculative. I see that the film spawned a sequel, ""Open Water 2: Adrift"", but the better follow up might have been to find out what happened with the negligent crew of the diving charter. Sure they did a head count, but not a roll call, which would have made more sense. The guy who double counted the diver who went in twice, let's see his explanation to an official inquest. Finding the personal belongings of the couple on the boat twenty four hours later also exposed the crew's negligence to some basic protocol.If you internet search the aftermath of the incident depicted in the story, there actually was a trial in the case of the deaths of Tom and Eileen Lonergan, whose bodies were never found to confirm their deaths, although articles of their diving gear were eventually discovered, but without signs of damage that one would expect from a shark attack. Their disappearance occurred in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, with the publicity surrounding the case spelling disaster for the Queensland diving industry.",365,0,,0,No reference

The episode surrounds Lucy's desire once again to be in Ricky's show, and she must lose 12 lbs in order to fit in the costume for the musical number with him. Thinking she is still the same weight as when she married Ricky, Lucy is stunned to realize that she has gained 20 pounds. With the help of Ethel, she goes on a crash diet and in a matter of four days manages to lose the weight and stashes the chorus girl Ricky has chosen into hiding so she can take over. But there's an interesting twist that will keep Lucy from going on further, and that makes this episode ironic as well as very funny.This episode has many extremely humorous moments, whether it is Lucy's attempt at exercising, her fury over only getting to eat celery while everybody else has steak and potatoes, or her desire to get at least one taste of beef by stealing it from the dog underneath the table. In the years that I have watched the show, I don't recall them having a dog, and this one pops up out of nowhere.

Suffice to say that casting Redford and Fonda as Southern characters was absurd, considering that the actual venue was a bit vague. Some scenes, especially the oil derrick, were obviously Southwest, perhaps Texas, while others could have been most anywhere. The accent however, was anywhere but Texas and was basically homogenized Southern. There was hardly an actor that did an acceptable job in that regard. Relying on time worn stereotypes was irresponsible, insensitive and dishonest. It was Southern bashing of the worse kind; we are to accept the notion that an entire town was a population of degenerates, wasting away their time engaging in every manner of human degradation. All appear to be victims as well as perpetrators. There was plenty of talent available, especially E.G. Marshall and Robert DuVall, but not nearly enough dialog allotted for either of those actors. In general, The Chase was awful in 1966 and is an even worse watch in 2012. Offensive to one's sensibilities and insulting to one's intelligence.",201,0,,0,No reference

It does have some differences from the earlier TV rendition and the comic book. If it was the same and had actors that looked/ sounded the same as before or were identical to them what would be the point in watching it ? It's a TV series of a comic book character and it has (so far) been done credibly and solidly. It has taken the basic premise and used it. The characters need some fleshing out and the actors need to grow into their skins. Hopefully the story lines will improve as the series grows.Watch it with an open mind.

You have to maintain the heart and soul of the story of an alien in a world that doesn't accept an outsider, while also shaping the story around a character who is essentially flawless. Brightburn takes the Superman mythos (whether the filmmakers want to admit it or not) and makes the hard left turn with Clark Kent's origin into horror territory. Brandon Breyer (because every comic character has to have alliteration) decides to use his supernatural abilities for evil, as he torments and murders people in his small town of Brightburn. While it certainly has its entertaining qualities, it fails to capture the horror of the third act because you never really grow to love Brandon as a normal kid anyway. If the first act chose to focus more on the human side of Brandon it could have easily made his turn more devastating and truly horrifying. Instead, it feels more like a low budget 'what if' story that doesn't give us the true payoff of what that question poses.6.2/10",183,0,,0,No reference

From all my love to the show I will try to explain why you should give it a chance.What we learn from Supernatural? We learn that struggle will never end for the warrior. Once you win a battle, a brand new challenge appears on your way. The same happens when you lose. And this is how we know life goes on as an immutable law of the Universe.We learn that family is not about your bloodlines, but about people you care of and who care of you. We learn that above all conventionalities there's a power taking care of us all. Every time Sam and Dean get lost, surrender or lose the fight, Life itself speaks to us through them. It says there's always a hope, even if you couldn't imagine this kind of its embodiment. We learn that the greatest power is available to everyone - a power of being a human. We also learn that guys can be so handsome that you ain't able to watch some episodes without distracting by your excitement :) And what we get above this appearance is brilliant acting of Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. With all due respect to other actors of the show, these two men strike right to your heart. They make you laugh and suffer together with their characters and you can't remember the moment when you've got so involved. If you let the Supernatural world come in your life you will discover a world of Courage, Love, Loyalty, Losses, Defeats and Desperation. And those ain't just words, you will feel each emotion deeply through the stories told by Winchester brothers. You will be exhausted with them after all the fights and you will be moved to tears about how beautiful our life is. Beautiful enough to always keep fighting on you way.",321,0,,0,No reference

Pat Healy, who I realized was in a bunch of stuff I watched over the years without ever really catching my attention, since the parts he played weren't worth a mention. Other than that, I only knew the name, but couldn't attribute to it anything of importance. If anyone had asked me about who I thought Pat Healy was, I would have told them that it's Patricia Healy they're talking about, some kind of female musician. Taylor Schilling's a different story. I definitely knew who she was, even without ever watching an episode of Orange Is The New Black. I saw her in The Overnight, a movie which kinda stuck with me, because it had some really interesting moments. Undoubtedly, an attractive woman, who is on the path of becoming a very good actress, due to the characters she chooses to play. This is certainly not the first (or last) comedy about a kidnapping situation, but nonetheless it's a funny one. It made me laugh, which, considering the volume of comedies I've watched over the years, is not an easy task.

Jack plans to use the money on his girlfriend (Pim Bubear) who he loves very much. However, what he doesn't know is that he is actually robbing from Asian crime lord Sirankiri (Steven Seagal). Soon Jack is forced into robbing even more banks and now the police are after him as well as Sirankiri.This is the first Seagal movie I've seen since his 1997 film FIRE DOWN BELOW. I knew that the actor had gone into the direct-to-video craze but I honestly just wasn't big enough of a fan to check out all of these movies. THE Asian CONNECTION grabbed my attention because I read some really negative reviews on it so I decided to check it out myself.There's no question that the awful reviews were right on the mark because this is a pretty darn bad movie no matter how you look at it. Obviously it was done on a very low-budget but the problem is that it's so poorly made that you just get bored by all of it. The direction by Daniel Zirilli is certainly a major issue because the action scenes all look horrible and there's not a single moment where the film contains any energy or excitement.Another problem is that you certainly don't care about any of the main characters. The love story subplot between Jack and his girlfriend is laughable at times and even everything with Seagal is pretty bland and boring. John Edward Lee's performance is also quite bad and it appears Seagal is just picking up a paycheck as he does very little with his role.THE Asian CONNECTION is a really bad movie that doesn't have a thing going for it.",302,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

Horror is mainly viewed by teenagers and men with a love for scares and horror always triumphs over fellow genres. Women tend to get scared while watching horror movies and that's why they prefer watching ""Romance"". Horror has it all: action, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, etc. but it is better than all other genres. Movies like The Ring, Grudge, Psycho, Scream, and Poltergeist, never have scared me while The Exorcist made me cr*p in my pants. Who would've thought that an 1980s movie could scare you. I certainly expected it to be a low-budget horror movie without any scares but I was wrong. In 1980s the graphics and make up can't compare with what we have today but The Exorcist didn't need lots of money or good makeup because it offered more than any other horror movie so far (2010). The story is intense and pretty terrifying but that's whats good about this movie. In the first two minutes it was all boring but then it reaches its potential and always achieve higher than it should and for that we are blessed to have great directors. The performances by Max Von Sydow is excellent along with Lee J. Cobb and Ellen Burstyn but the real show catcher is that sweet little girl who gets possessed by the devil himself, and that lady is Linda Blair. She really gave it her best from the point to where she was human to when she gets possessed. Her devil act really had me shaking and screaming as she talked with a voice full of horror and dread. She has achieved a great career in film industry so far. The Christian theme will have some religious people p*ssed of and so be cautious when you are watching The Exorcist. Strange thing is that the novel is somewhat scarier than the film.A mysterious entity has stolen 12 year-old Regan's body and is using it to commit sins. Her mother is terrified and doesn't know what to do to stop this entity from wrecking hell. She seeks the help of a priest named Father Merrin for he is the one who can exorcise this girl and stop the demon once and for all. Be warned horror lovers even you will die of a heart attack so be cautious and have the remote in your hand for it will become handy! Mwahahhahhaha! Sorry about that evil laugh. Mwahahhaha! If you don't like spoilers, skip this part. Read the first word in the next sentence! (Spoiler!!!!) Regan has been quite naughty and she has been doing naughty acts for instance, the spider walk scared the hell outta people while the spinning head made people look away. Maybe vomiting on somebody can surely be dirty and Regan has done just that. I know someone will have a hard time washing that shirt. (SPOILER END!!!!) Nothing can compare, in film history, to that demonic voice spoken by the possessed Regan and it is one of the most original and best voices in film. The 1980s style well have you enjoying The Exorcist a bit more for those of you who have lived through the eighties in America. The Exorcist is my favorite film of William Friedkin and can you guys please watch this for my and many others sake. If you don't then shame on you for being so ignorant because you are missing out on the best horror film that will be and is the best in film history. I really loved the screenplay, script, performances by some, the novel by William Peter Blatty, and definitely the sound. The most definitive movie about possession has been made thirty years ago and it still is definitive to this day.

It occurred the first time in 1945's ""Conflict"", but in that picture, it was Bogey's character who did the pursuing, while here, it's Cecily Latham (Smith) who intrudes on Geoffrey Carroll's marriage to the second Mrs. Carroll of the title. By that time though, Sally Morton (Barbara Stanwyck) had already been the 'other woman' to the first Mrs.C., who we only know by the 'Angel of Death' painting. Taking a chapter from ""Bluebeard"", Bogey's character is an artist who paints his victims before they succumb to a spiked milk cocktail.It's never made clear how chemist Blagdon (Barry Bernard) figures out that Mr. Carroll is the customer who signs for his prescriptions as Fleming. But if he was that sharp, he should also have concluded that if Carroll was deranged enough to kill his first wife by poisoning, then knocking off a druggist wouldn't be much of a stretch. Too bad, he turned the screws just a little too tight for his own good.Nigel Bruce is quite adequate depicting a country doctor who looks in on the Carroll's, you might call his performance right as rain. It's Dr. Tuttle's single minded obsession with an Ashton burglar and a Yorkshire strangler that gives Mr.C the idea for his farewell plans for wife number two. If only he'd have cut the phone line a minute sooner.Perhaps the surprise performance in this tale belongs to the actress portraying daughter Bea, an unusually precocious Ann Carter. Watching her, it was almost impossible to believe that a child could converse with the language she used. It was somewhat irritating though to see how compliant she was with every single idea her father advanced, especially going away to school. I think she could have done some damage once the fireworks started.Bogart and Stanwyck are genuinely competent in their roles; Stanwyck in particular turning things up a notch when it becomes clear that she could wind up a murder victim. The pair had generally good chemistry together, and seemed to be a better match than the intruder Cecily might have been with Mr. Carroll. Chalk that up to a fine performance by Alexis Smith, as this viewer found it hard to warm up to her character. Bogart fans might have some fun comparing his performance here against his similar character in the aforementioned ""Conflict"", a film which for my two cents is the stronger of the two.",426,0,,0,No reference

I appreciated the willingness of the film to make me sit uncomfortably with my emotions and the subtle reveals throughout that made it more difficult to do so.I think my biggest issue here is that like others have noted, this film does feel very slow at times. Much too slow. It is one thing to use slow pacing effectively and another to drag scenes that do not say anything out for what felt like no reason.

But Gerald's Game proved me wrong. There are so many hidden aspects of this movie that you just don't expect. Carla Gugino's performance as the main character, Jessie, is fantastic and she manages to carry the movie practically all by herself. Jessie's character is slowly dissected throughout and it's living through her struggles - past and present - that keeps you hooked and wanting to watch more. The relationship between Jessie and her husband Gerald is authentic and believable. Even the character of Gerald (played by Bruce Greenwood), who was in the movie for a very short period of time, brought an element of fear and tension to the movie, when his sexual preferences suggest there may be a more sinister side to him. Admittedly, it is slow in parts and there are areas where it starts to drag, but ultimately it's an engaging movie throughout. By delving into Jessie's psyche it has you doubt her mental state and what is real and what isn't, but also allows viewers to form a connection with her and sympathise with her as a character. The ending has a twist that I didn't see coming, which I'm still unsure about. Was it genius or was it silly? I'll let you be the judge of that. Personally, I found it interesting although it didn't necessarily fit right with the rest of the movie. The only reason this gets 7 stars is because of the slow pacing in places, lack of build-up and slightly unsatisfying ending.",290,0,,0,No reference

It's rare that I find myself in this position. Usually I either hate or love a film, or find a movie not worth bothering with at all. But this one, whilst most certainly not impressing me at all, is neither bad enough for me to slate it, nor good enough for me to sing it's praises.Quite simply, I'm not sure what Burton was trying to do here. I understand all the metaphors and allegories that are present, but the ultimate goal of the film eludes me. Was it to make me think about how I relate to my father? Was it trying to tell me that not all stories are made up, or true? Was it simply trying to point out the difficulties of having a larger than life personality in a boring, mundane world? Is it all of the above? And, at the end, do we actually care?A film has to be entertaining on some level in order to keep the audience's attention. BF does this, but only just. At no point do you feel any great empathy for the character of the Father, as told in his stories. In fact, there's nothing about the film as a whole which really grasps your attention and demands that you continue watching.Perhaps the biggest failing, as with many other films, is the hype that surrounds them. BF has been hyped up as a wonderful movie that will astonish and delight. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver on that promise. In the end, it's just the story of a man coming to terms with his father's death and helping through that time and coming to understand himself better in the process. Throw in a few gentle fantasy elements and that's really all there is to Big Fish.Ultimately not so much of a Big Fish, as the One That Got Away....",331,0,,0,No reference

Which he does his best with handling Outlaws and Unwelcome visitors. When a mysterious alcoholic, who goes by the name of Dude (Dean Martin) also known as ""Borachon"". Dude becomes the sheriff's deputy after helping John handling the Outlaws in the saloon. When Dude is giving another chance for redemption, especially since he tries hard to quit drinking. When one of those trouble makers by the name of Joe Brudette (Claude Atkins) starts making trouble in the town. Chance and Dude takes care of that problem, since Brudette is a killer. Now when Brudette's older brother Nathan (John Russell) starts showing up with his men, which he wants his brother out of jail. Since his brother is wanted by the Authorities but it will take them nearly a week to come to ""Rio Bravo"". Since Nathan is a rich ruthless man, he will stop at nothing to get his brother back. Now Chance and Dude finds themselves in trouble. But they are not alone, since they have help from John's loyal jail guard old crippler Grumpy (Walter Brennan), a young eager gunslinger Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson), a kind man who owns the hotel/saloon (Perdo Gonzalez Gonzalez) and a clever care-free woman named Feathers (Angie Dickension), who finds Chance interesting.Directed by Howard Hawks (His Girl Friday, Red River, Scarface) made an intelligent Western that has a big heart, great performance, creative action sequences and an refreshing sense of humour. I never seen this movie until now, although i heard of Hawks. I never seen his films before. I did see ""The Thing from Another World"". Which he co-directed but he's uncredited. The picture still looks great, since it's been nearly 50 years ago it came out. This is very well filmed by cinematographer Russell Harlan, which he's makes this feature looks stylish for its time. There's many good sequences... especially when it's character-driven dialogue scenes, moments of romance or action.The two-disc set from ""Rio Bravo"". DVD is been digitally remastered for clean picture-quality and sound. Disc 1 has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono Sound. DVD includes trailers from other ""John Wayne"" pictures and an informative if somewhat quiet commentary by ""Time"" film critic:Richard Schickel and filmmaker:John Carpenter (Assault on Precient 13, Halloween, The Thing). Disc 2 includes an documentary about Howard Hawks' film-making career, featurette on ""Rio Bravo"" with interviews from cast member Dickenson, film critics & fans of this movie and a small featurette about the film's location and the other classic Westerns were filmed there. ""Rio Bravo"" is a movie that still looks good after 50 years, it shows how strong that this feature could such an impact over all these years. Some viewers might find this silly at times, especially when the Characters start bonding and singing in the sheriff's station. But it's all in good fun, probably the only complaint in this movie. It's goes on a bit too long than it should. But still, don't miss this excellent movie. Screenplay by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett (The Empire Strikes Back, The Big Sleep, The Long Goodbye).

The actor are normal not the best but not the worst But there a couple of scenes that are pretty cool just like when the zombies are walking to the church or the scene when the characters discover the corpses of the wife and there's some likable character but nothing else and fulci put more action in the last part of the film which is good but nothing else Does anybody thing that the zombies looks like the dead in the beyond??,260,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

The episode opens in Forthaven's bar; a strange man enters and asks for a drink then instead of handing over a card he drops a handful of diamonds in payment! Not surprisingly this creates a bit of a stir and he ends up in a fight with the Expeditionaries. Cass and Fleur are called and end up chasing him out of town, when they catch up with him they are lost but he offers to take them to the sea claiming that there are bodies there and that they will find paradise they aren't keen to follow but have little choice. Stella, Jack and a tracker follow when they realise they are missing and that the strange man is Pak, part of the original group to land on Carpathia many years before. Meanwhile back in Forthaven people are obsessed with finding diamonds of their own which leads to an unusual agreement between Julius and Tate although it seems likely that the former is just using the situation to further his own agenda.This episode had some gripping moments and gave the makers an excuse to show off some beautiful South African scenery as Fleur, Cass and Pak trek to the sea. Once again things are hinted at rather than explicitly explained; it is said the Pat murdered the leader of his group but we never learn if he did or if something else happened; we also don't know if the animals he sees are imaginary or part of some strange phenomena on Carpathia. One strange thing was the population's excitement about the discovery of diamonds; there was no obvious use for them so they would have little real value there.",301,0,,0,No reference

My local streets were full of Saracens and Pigs and the skies reverberated with the noise of Westland Scouts and Sioux helicopters, and we had these strange men in flak jackets (usually stuck together with black tape) with hugely long rifles, talking in strange accents, running across streets and hiding behind fences. And, of course, being killed. This series did its' best to reflect that; no whys or wherefores, no politics or hand wringing, just men in a situation that for better or worse had found them in a corner of the United Kingdom facing bricks, bombs and bullets. A lot of it reflected what I saw every day, and I'm sure the Barracks life they depicted was familiar to many an old soldier. It wasn't sensationalist, as many programmes made today are, nor did it give a sense of being larger than life. It just was life, every day, warts and all, and all the more real for that. My only gripe is the depiction of the Northern Ireland Police - the RUC - as there are errors in the uniform and equipment depicted, but if you can get hold of a copy - it's available on DVD these days - it's a real nostalgia trip into the pre-mobile phone and Internet era of old cars, dirty streets and dead-end lives.

But if I do away that ending and replace it with the novel's ending from William March I really cannot fault this movie. Even though differing from the book as in leaving some characters out (only 1 Fern sister instead of 3 and Leroy's wife is not in the movie), adding Christine's father Richard Bravo as ""living"" character and scrapping the scenes where Leroy interacts with his wife; the movie captures the spirit of the book perfectly. Well the movie feels stagy which is normal because it was a play before it became a movie. Also most of the stage players would eventually reprise their role in the movie which probably shows why the characters work so well together. Really everyone plays their role sublime no one was miscast. Kudos mostly to Nancy Kelly as mother Christine and the young Patty McCormack as little Rhoda. She would eventually feature as titular character in the Mommy movies in the 1990s where she shows similar personality treats as in The Bad Seed but there as an adult. It doesn't matter how many times I watch this movie and that it is old and tame to today's standards. It's message remains powerful and disturbing. The icing on the cake are for me the interactions between Rhoda and Leroy. Both of them are interesting character studies, a mean bully versus a manipulative child that sure gives fireworks, literally! But also the case of mother Christine is seriously an interesting one and that of serial killer Bessie Denker who was based on a real killer and the inspiration of March's novel.",288,0,,0,No reference

And I on occasion watch the reruns on late night TV on cable's/satellite's TNT(Turner Network Television). The original show had charm to it but this reunion lacked that charm and a decent story line.""CHiPs"" 99 seemed more like a two hour version of a 60 minute episode that would not end. The made for TV movie was inconsistent with the original TV series. Larry Wilcox, who portrayed Officer John Baker left the show the year before it was canceled. So the following season the show wrote him off by having him go to work on the family farm/ranch. So, for the reunion, Officer Baker somehow becomes a captain, mean while Officer Francis ""Ponch"" Poncherello, Erik Estrada had disappeared because his wife was ""sick."" Its funny that in the made for TV flick there is one scene in which Baker tells Ponch that he was not invited to his wedding because he did not know where he was. In real life during the shows peak I read that Erik Estrada had not invited Wilcox to his wedding and when Wilcox was married he did the same. I just think its funny that the producers decided to actually put that into the storyline. Seems like it would have brought up some bad blood or the producers had some twisted sense of humor.I wish that the producers for this special would have elected to use at least a cliché cop reunion special storyline. Something like all the old cops get back together to help find the murderer of one of their own, Harlan gets killed during a carjacking. Or Ponch gets framed for a string of carjacking murders and Baker comes out of retirement to help his buddy out. Even those story lines would have been far more enjoyable. Its like the producers rehashed an old episode and went on autopilot. Oh and Baker and Ponch appear on Judge Judy within the show because a neighbor's dog is damaging Baker's lawn. And Johnny Cochran makes a guest appearance for the neighbor that Baker is suing. Can we say lame, really lame.The special also had several of the original cast but the only ones that were really utilized were Estrada, Wilcox, and Robert Pine (Sgt.

But it does not have the power of these movies at all. In fact towards the end, some scenes were quite reminiscent of Deathdream, for example. But while Deathdream moved me to tears, I am not sure of this movie had any impact on me at all. For such a sad story, the impact is quite less. The performances are good but maybe there are problems with the pacing and the script. The things that happen are so clichéd and everything's been done before in much better ways. Even as a horror movie, it doesn't work perfectly. Not even a couple of jump scares which could provide some cheap thrills. At no point is this adorable little girl ever threatening. Last one is a shallow complaint. But the Arthur character was a little distracting because I remember as that character in the movie Enchanted. I just couldn't take him seriously.

Pero 'Lo que el viento se llevó' es la obra maestra de la industria cinematográfica, la obra maestra de un productor y de un equipo de artistas y artesanos con un objetivo común: hacer la mejor película de la historia cinematográfica estadounidense hasta esa fecha, 1.939. Bajo la dirección estuvieron George Cukor, Sam Wood y el mismísimo David Selznick además de Victor Fleming, que fue quien la acabó y quien rodó toda la segunda parte del filme. En el aspecto musical, para dar redondez al esplendoroso trabajo de Max Steiner, se había contratado a William Axt y a Franz Waxman además de poner a orquestadores de la Warner a componer como Adolph Deutsch, Hugo Friedhofer o Heinz Roemheld. No hay nada más que ver la cantidad de nombres del personal que trabajó para esta producción para darse cuenta de las dimensiones del proyecto para esa época.Y luego está el guión, ese guión cuyas frases se han hecho célebres a lo largo de décadas, con magníficos diálogos de inolvidable memoria que vertebran el curso narrativo de una historia imperecedera que no decae en ningún momento y que va acelerando el interés del público conforme va avanzando el metraje. Un guión igualmente de equipo con Sidney Howard a la cabeza pero con talentos fuera de lo común como Ben Hecht o Jo Swerling.En los estrenos de 1939 pocas fueron las actuaciones que se pudieron ver en las salas de cine tan subyugantes como las que aportaron las actrices y los actores de 'Lo que el viento se llevó'. Y si uno analiza los trabajos de Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland o de maravillosos secundarios como Thomas Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel, Ward Bond o Harry Davenport, la inolvidable aportación de Butterfly McQueen como 'Prissy', observa que en pocos filmes de estas características desarrolla su elenco tanta calidad como en 'Lo que el viento se llevó'.Fotografía, vestuario, maquillaje y peluquería asi como el decorado con esas máscaras pintadas como fondos, auténticas obras de arte del diseño y la pintura, sumaron detalles de una enorme calidad artística que hicieron a mi juicio de 'Lo que el viento se llevó' el mejor melodrama épico de la Historia del Cine. Un melodrama, por otra parte, que se zambulle en otros géneros; en el bélico a través de los temas de la barbarie y la sinrazón de la guerra, y en el del oeste a través de los temas de la cargas de la caballería y el expolio a los civiles.En resumen, una obra maestra absoluta que perdurará en la memoria de quien la contemple bajo los acordes de 'El tema de Tara' (tema principal) de Max Steiner, de quien el célebre director de orquesta y compositor Leonard Bernstein afirmó que ninguna música como la de Steiner para 'Lo que el viento se llevó' exportó tanta popularidad de la cultura musical americana al extranjero.Imprescindible para coleccionistas del buen cine.",515,0,,0,No reference

It works when it wants to and it does have its funny moments. Although considering other Disney films,it doesn't have as many laughs but I think that works because then it makes the comedic scenes all the more funny,especially the sergeant's back story and the laffy taffy which are some of the highlights of the film. As far as the characters go,I think they're decent enough. Sergeant Calhoun is a pretty good character with a hilariously tragic back story installed, Vanellope is just annoyingly cute, Fix it Felix Jr is a likable character as is Ralph. But the character that stood out has to be King Candy. My favourite aspect about him is the design,I just love how much the design and his personality is based off the mad hatter and it shows throughout. Now for the things I didn't like. The pace of the film is a bit distracting as about forty five minutes in, Vanellope is already being introduced and from then on,you're pretty much stuck in Sugar Rush. There are a few cut away scenes but they don't last for more the five minutes. Another thing that I didn't particularly like was the training sequence. The scene itself was good but I felt the song they chose to go with it felt out of place and it didn't go with it. But my biggest gripe about this film is the 'I'm bad and that's good. I will never be good,and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me.' thing. It is a good message and all,but I find it a bit mushy for my tastes.Overall,a pretty good film and is definitely worth checking out at least once.",332,0,,0,No reference

Bill Skarsgard and Tom Holland were most likely my two favourites. When I was reading the pages of Donald Ray Pollocks writing, it almost seems like he was writing about Skarsgard and Holland. They embody the characters of Willard and Arvin perfectly and I will continue to imagine them as the father and son. Holland shows some real acting chops here and I truly hope he gets some awards attention for his great performance here. I hope that he takes more roles like this in the future and doesn't just stick to big budget lifeless Spider-Man movies, I'm excited to see him in Cherry, if that still releases this year.The cinematography was great and the 35mm feel to it all worked seamlessly to set the old Southern tone of the story. I really respect the choice to shoot on film and when you watch the film the grain covering the screen almost comes across as dirt or dust and adds so much to the style of the film.The main issue I have with the film is the use of a narrorator. This films use of narrotation is the laziest choice I have seen in a film in recent memory. I honest to god would've given this film a much higher rating if they just removed the absolutely pointless narroration. You can tell what the actor is feeling, I don't need it explained to me that Arvin is feeling sad, I KNOW HE'S SAD! I'm also well aware that the novel had a narrorator as well, but there's a huge diffrence between writing a novel and writing a film. You can't see a character walk into a building in a book it's not a visual medium, in a film you can see an actor weep or show the emotion the narrorator is telling the audience they're feeling. There's a classic rule to storytelling which is to show, not to tell. This film attempts to do both and drags the excellent quality of the rest of the film down substantially.I'm also torn on the changes to many elements of Arvin's motivations here. In the book there was a real sense that Arvin not just had a sisterly love for Lenora but also a sexual one and I didn't really get that impression here. I know it's weird, but I felt the film cheated a bit not including that element. Also, the changed circumstances behind the films final act and the character of Roy are strange to see be changed, but I do not hate the differences here as they do progress the story a lot faster than the book.In conclusion, The Devil All The Time has some wonderful performances, ideas, cinematography and directing, however unfortunately the film doesn't entirely live up to the incredibly high standards of Donald Ray Pollack's masterpiece novel and the inclusion of narroration to dumb down the story is a very bad decision.Honestly, someone needs to make a cut of this film without the narroration and it would honestly be a substantially better film.",560,0,,0,No reference

917,2120974,2011-05-04,barnabyrudge,Camelot (1967),6.0,"Based on a hit 1960 Broadway show which starred Richard Burton (who declined to resume the role for this film adaptation), Camelot is a mixed bag of a movie. Its songs are generally excellent, there are individually impressive sequences but the whole is less than the sum of its parts. As Camelot draws to its climax, one can't help but feel a slight sense of disappointment; a feeling, perhaps, that the opportunity for something fabulous has been missed. It's a good film, yes, but not a brilliant one.Reluctant King Arthur (Richard Harris) prefers to spend his time wandering in the marshes rather than carrying out his kingly duties. When he is betrothed to be married to Guinevere (Vanessa Redgrave) – whom he has never even met – he considers running away to avoid the marriage. Guinevere also has her doubts about the union and plots to run away. By chance, the two of them meet in the marshes and promptly fall in love. Later, they come up with the idea of forming a selective band of knights, the Round Table, where the greatest horsemen, swordsmen, archers and warriors can join up to protect the land. ""Might for right"" as Arthur proudly declares. Many knights are eager to join, one of the last being Frenchman Lancelot Du Lac (Franco Nero). Arthur is thrilled to have Lancelot among his trusty followers, but Guinevere initially dislikes the French knight, despising his too-perfect attitude and dedication and continual tall-stories about previous feats. However, following a remarkable joust during which Lancelot somehow revives a seemingly dead man, a flicker of affection develops between he and Guinevere. It eventually blossoms into a full-blown scandalous affair, and when Arthur learns of his wife's infidelity he must take the difficult decision of how to deal with her and her disgraced lover.Much has been made of the decision to use mainly non-singing actors in this film. This inexperience is slightly noticeable during Harris and Redgrave's musical numbers, but not to such a degree that it destroys the film. Nero's songs are dubbed, perhaps wisely (his spoken dialogue is tricky enough to decipher due to his accent, so one assumes any singing he did in person must have been pretty incomprehensible). The film is spectacular and lavish throughout, with wonderful sets and costumes and a clutch of classic scenes. The jousting sequence in particular is quite brilliantly done. Unfortunately there are frequent dull patches too, where things drag on rather pointlessly and plot developments are hammered home with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The three hour running time is ultimately too long by at least 30 minutes, but amidst the over-indulgence there remain enough plus points to make Camelot worth a look.",453,0,,0,No reference
918,2401064,2013-01-06,p-stepien,攔截記憶碼 (I) (2012),3.0,"In a post-apocalyptic dystopian future, where a vast part of the world in incapable of sustaining human-life all people inhabit two areas: the United Federation of Britain and the subservient Colony (found in Australia). The less-populated colony serves mostly as cheap labour for UFB, traversing daily by dropping directly through the Earth via ""the Fall"", a gravity elevator taking the most direct route to the other side of the world. Amongst those who commute is factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), happily married to Lori (Kate Beckinsale), but still with a lingering feeling of emptiness. When co-worker Mac (John Cho) convinces Quaid to seek the services of Rekall, a semi-legal company dealing with computer imprinted dreams, he decides to take on the visage of an special agent. The resulting programme initiation brings about an unexpected realisation, that Quaid has repressed memories, as in fact in the past he once was a secret double agent of the UFB and opposing insurgents. Thus his beloved wife is a hoax, with his true love being rebel Melina (Jessica Biel). Or is it?Remolding vast parts of the 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick and the Arnold Schwarzeneggar original feature brings together a dishevelled story, which at times seems all too reminiscent borrowing vast sequences and moments from its superior predecessor, while at others bringing about wholesale changes which detrimentally make the trip overly fantastic, even for a sci-fi movie. Nonetheless ""Total Recall"" features a visually stunning future metropolis, albeit borrowing undoubted inspiration from the ""Bladerunner"" with a touch ""The Fifth Element"", still comes off as original and breathtaking, undoubtedly the highlight of what is otherwise a disappointing venture into the whacked out mind of American novelist Philip K. Dick. In search of some mode to forward the story Len Wiseman changes the whole movie into a prolonged triangle cat-fight, where Lori has the knack for appearing in every other scene, at times seemingly self-teleporting herself or even rising from the dead, to enter into a brutal marriage spat with Quaid or direct her aggressive brutality towards Melina. Making Lori into what is basically the key antagonist, especially given her paper-thin character development and Beckinsale's lazy portrayal, proves especially distracting, as the narratives inexplicably suffers. Not much is helped by Jessica Biel, the third in this misguided lover's triangle, who does an absolutely atrocious acting job, losing many acting creds and coming off as pure eye candy. With all these factors kicking in not even the undoubted screen presence of Colin Farrell can bring the movie back on board. Labored with some conspicuous plot tools such as the introduction of Hammond (played by Dylan Scott Smith) an essentially conceptless ""Total Recall"" lacks any longevity with its limited sensibility.",462,0,,0,No reference

What makes the best story? One that leaves you asking questions. It's what pulls you in as a reader/watcher and makes you invested in the environment/world the story takes place in. This is why, in part, Star Wars (1977) did so well. It left you asking questions, like: The Empire? what's that? whats a lightsaber? (that was a question at one point) who are the jedi?who are Luke's parents? why does this Ben dude know him? what's the rebellion? how did this all start? han solo himself, an air of mystery various questions raised by the size of the universe, planets, alien species, etcThen there's the steampunk feel of the original Star Wars movies.tatooine: dirty, gritty, old, broken, bleak, organic, rusted death star: shiny, metallic, obsidian, visual weight forest places: wooden, organic, stone overall: things built into the environment, like Luke's home on tattoine and the yavin 4 base/templeThen story/character development: lost, isolated, ""nobody"" characters getting swept up into a larger story and finding purpose, meaning, and hope. You might even say destiny. A small subset of this was the consistent casting of up-and-coming/no-name actors as the character leads in the following films.In my opinion, all of the above is what DEFINES Star Wars. This is why, when they announced the new films in 2012, I was particularly interested in seeing them hold to these ideals. As I followed the production process, I was looking for evidence that they were holding to those ideals, or at least hopefully wayyyyyyy more than Lucas' prequel trilogy.Going into the new film, I was mostly concerned with them capturing the look and feel of the original movies. I determined that if they got that right, the story could be appreciated more. Since they got Lawrence Kasdan (writer of the Empire Strikes Back, my favorite movie) on board with writing credits along with JJ Abrams and Michael Arndt (both huge Star Wars fans), I was less concerned with the story they wrote than they means they chose to convey it. I was a little concerned about the reprisal of characters from the original trilogy that are WELL on in years, but I didn't put much thought into it because I knew the story wasn't going to be about them.I'm happy to say: JJ ABRAMS AND CO DID NOT LET US DOWN.The look and feel of the original movies has been captured here. They built real sets and props, by hand, but weren't afraid to lean on the use of digital technology as needed. The result is a movie filled with gritty, organic places that just plain and simple...feel real. The digital effects, are soooooooo good too. Probably the most real-looking lightsaber effects I've ever seen.The newest cast members, while no-namers, are FANTASTIC. The older actors really shine through as well, a lot more than I thought, honestly. Especially Harrison Ford, he really manages to still capture the same spirit that makes him Han Solo, despite being considerably older. The new story raises plenty of questions as well, really setting the stage for the following films and what's to come. But, as I've hinted at, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the film on the look and feel alone. Let's also not forget NEW STAR WARS MUSIC. The newest John Williams score is fantastic, and is essential to capturing the magic of what Star Wars feels like. The only criticism I have for the OST release is that we don't get to hear the main character themes fleshed out quite as much as we do in the movie, mostly cause of the prevalence of action-carrying motifs and sequences. I give it a 10/10, some people might give it 9/10.",647,0,,0,No reference

With that, this is still worth everyone's time and it's a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion it's better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror! Story takes place in the small German town of Klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks. Burgermister Gustave Schoen (Lionel Belmore) shouts ""It's Vampires"" but the local police chief Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas) thinks it's a madman who's responsible and he vows to catch him.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The Burgermeister and most of the towns folk think that the local kook Herman Glieb (Dwight Frye) who loves bats and frequently talks to them is the one they are looking for and they chase him until he falls to his death in a cave. The one who is responsible for the killings is Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who has created a new form of tissue mass that feeds on blood and he accomplishes this by having some sort of mind control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazer) who goes out at night to collect the blood. Dr. Otto has a pretty assistant named Ruth Bertin (Fay Wray) and an annoying aunt named Gussie (Maude Eburne) but they have no clue what he's up to but Karl eventually become suspicious when one of the murders takes place after Herman's death.Frank R. Strayer was never confused with being James Whale but he was a pretty competent director who ended up directing most of the ""Blondie"" films in that series and with this film he uses the same sets from ""The Old Dark House"" which was also filmed at Universal. I'm the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but it's practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including Frye who is pretty much doing his Renfield role only this time he befriends bats and strokes them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping! One thing that just doesn't make sense is the mind control that Dr. Otto has over Emil as the film never explains this and I had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" but on the other hand it's probably just the weakest part of the script. There are a few other tidbits that I noticed including the chase of Frye to the big caves which is obviously an early shot of the infamous Bronson Canyon where numerous other films have been made and also Wray's brown hair which is her true color. True horror film fans will appreciate this more than others but I think this is a fun film to view for everyone and with a cast as attractive as this it's well worth a look.",511,0,,0,No reference

But that's what Hero does to its audience. The gravity-defying duels between swordsmen are some of the most spectacular you'll ever see.
As the film opens, the king honors a warrior called Nameless, who has slain three famous assassins that threatened the throne during the conquest. The reward: a private meeting with the king. This hero, played perfectly by international martial arts legend Jet Li, grants the king's wish; he relates the stories of how he outwitted these legendary killers-Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Sky (Donnie Yen).
In the style of Rashomon, Nameless's stories are offered to us in multiple, contradictory flashbacks. Each story he relates raises the king's suspicion and requires a revision. Thus, Nameless and his targets are portrayed in a variety of relationships, sometimes meeting different fates. Each enthralling flashback is portrayed in a distinct array of colors.In one, Nameless and Sky meet in a spectacular duel that's as much a match between their minds as it is between their blades. In another, Nameless helps Broken Sword and Flying Snow defend a calligraphy school from the oncoming forces of the king's warriors. This involves deflecting relentless torrents of arrows that are launched in a siege that resembles the ferocity of The Two Towers' Battle of Helm's Deep. Nameless opposes this siege in order to gain the killers' trust, to learn their weakness, and to defeat them using their own passions for one another. Zhang Ziyi, sporting the same youthful ego and impertinence that she portrayed in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, plays a key role here as Broken Sword's servant, Moon. Two more astonishing clashes-one a breathtaking ballet in a storm of falling yellow leaves, the other a battle on the surface of a magnificent lake-are each worth the price of admission; it's unlikely you'll see anything so memorable all year.
But the most important clash is the one between the hero's narratives and the king's questioning. Nameless is clearly superior to those whose weapons he has claimed and set down before the king. But what has made him such an unparalleled warrior? And what will he ask of the king now that he has performed this feat as a volunteer?
To say more about the plot would be to spoil the story's most interesting twist. And besides, there is much to say in honor of the cast and crew.Nameless is a perfect role for Jet Li. The part asks little of his acting talents (fortunately) and much from his athletic abilities. Similarly, Donnie Yen (Blade II, Shanghai Knights) turns Sky into a man who gets right down to business, letting his sword do the talking.Hero also burns with immediacy and relevance. As China struggles with the division between Beijing and Taiwan, Zhang Yimou poses a heartfelt challenge. He acknowledges the value of unification and peace. He knows that militant resistance of the empire's progress can lead only to more violence and loss. But he reminds the viewer that the peculiarity of unique, diverse cultures produces valuable, irreplaceable rewards ... and people. It is as if the storyteller cannot find a satisfactory conclusion to his own epic.
Thus, American viewers may be unsettled by the conclusion, as there seems to be no room for democracy in Hero's paradigm. In a worldview that reveres the will of a conqueror over the will of a benevolent God, ""peace"" comes at a cost that will give no one true peace. That is why, in the end, Hero remains a conflicted, colorfully turbulent film. By the time the climactic challenge occurs, few will find themselves unmoved by the king's good intentions; but after his bloody campaigns, he is not the man who earns the title ""hero.""Seen in this light, Hero's distinct, aerobatic duels come to represent the power of art to communicate ideas across borders and languages, from common people to kings, emperors, and presidents. The story's emphasis on the art of calligraphy is connected to its exhibitions of swordsmanship-in developing an artful style of writing, Broken Sword and Flying Snow prove that the pen can indeed be mightier than the sword. This metaphor, along with the film's explorations of conscience, fidelity, trust, and responsibility, make Hero ultimately an insightful and rewarding achievement.",726,0,,0,No reference

The soundtrack was quite impressive, and readily brought to mind the finer moments the band Goblin had provided in their work for Dario Argento's string of 70's-80's giallo masterpieces. The production values were quite decent overall for such a film, and I loved both the premise and its execution.Annik Borel was exemplary as the ill-fated protagonist Daniela, and takes a few lessons from Linda Blair's portrayal of the possessed in 'The Exorcist' for whenever she loses control of her inhibitions and resorts to her more animalistic urges. Kudos to the filmmakers for bringing psychological issues and the effects of sexual abuse and rape to the forefront, even if it's for an 'exploitation' film.Yes, the story arc is predictable (though suspense-fully carried out), there is gratuitous sex and nudity at every conceivable moment (and a lot of inconceivable ones!), and you get that tired lie 'this is a true story--only the names have been changed', but it's as if you would think those are bad things. It was a great 79 minutes I will always fondly remember--unless I get Altzheimer's disease or something. Highly recommended to anyone who loves 70's horror movies, softcore porn, or exploitation films in general. 70's Italian movies aren't so bad.",225,0,,0,No reference

Before he became increasingly temperamental and left Hollywood a few years later, Maurice Tourneur made some memorable silent films. This is one of them. Lorna Doone is based on the famous 1874 novel by Richard D. Blackmore. It's probably not the greatest romance of all time as advertised, but it holds its own as a good example of silent film melodrama. Unlike many films of the era, the film is not as predictable plot-wise, the acting and cinematography are first rate, and the pacing moves well throughout the film. John Bowers stars as John Ridd a poor, working class strong man who falls for Mae Giraci as a young boy. She is kidnapped essentially and raised as a Doone. The Doones, of course, are the upper class ruffians who frequently are at odds with the John Ridds of the world. Madge Bellamy is absolutely radiant as the adult Lorna Doone, who is torn between staying with the Doones and fulfilling her royal destiny and her loyalty to her childhood love John Ridd. The film sweeps us away with its romance, creating just the right tension, although the ending is a bit unbelievable and seems out of sync with the tone of the rest of the film. Otherwise, it's a very entertaining, romantic film. Leading man John Bowers lead an almost equally melodramatic life when his career was ended by the sound era; he later committed suicide by drowning himself. *** of 4 stars.",256,0,,0,No reference

The dark colors in the photography and dialog fit each scene and made all the characters stand out. What was really clever was how the writer tied the different segments into finding and identifying the dead girl and how the characters were each in their own way, rather bleak and very dark ""Shakespearean"" men and women all thrown into this witch's kettle of death and tragedy.

931,301969,2001-07-02,Buddy-51,All the Pretty Horses (2000),,"If a movie could ever be used to prove the existence of entropy, `All the Pretty Horses' would definitely be it. Here is a film so devoid of energy and momentum that it seems to be not a movie at all but a succession of still images fading in and out of each other at an enervating pace. Put simply, as director, Billy Bob Thornton has made a world-class snorer out of Cormac McCarthy's best selling novel, for, indeed, rarely has an adventure story seemed so lackluster in its pacing, so inert in its narrative momentum. The characters even seem to talk in muted whispers, as if they were afraid to violate the atmosphere of profundity that surrounds the project.

All that would be fine if the film actually had something profound to say. Unfortunately, this is a pretty shallow story filled with deeper meanings hinted at but never explored and characters who are never given the screen time to grow into fully developed people in their own right. Matt Damon and Henry Thomas star as two Texas cowboys who head to Mexico looking for adventure and en route end up befriending a disturbed teenager, working as horse wranglers on a tycoon's ranch and even spending time in a Mexican penitentiary. In its bare boned outlining, this plot seems rife with possibilities. However, it is difficult to overestimate just how tediously it all plays out on screen. For one thing, the motives for many of the characters' actions remain murky at best, partly, I feel, because the authors rarely seem to know where to best concentrate their focus for maximum clarity and effect. The quirky and enigmatic teen, for instance, who has the potential to be the most interesting character in the story, disappears through large chunks of the film, so that poor-as-dirt Damon, in one of the oldest plot devices known to man, can play footsy with the tycoon's beautiful, dark-haired daughter. The movie tries to imply that the rich man feels hurt and betrayed by Damon's romancing of his daughter because he has grown so fond and trusting of the young man. Yet, we never really see that bond developing. We are simply told it exists and are expected to react accordingly.

This is the case with much of the film. Despite the movie's near-two hour running time, we never feel like we get to know or understand any of these characters. The landscapes are pretty, but the deadly pacing of the film destroys our interest even in THEM. Ultimately, the film feels unformed, as if it were nothing more than a series of unrelated incidents arbitrarily strung together in a pointless slow-moving jumble. Maybe the pretty pictures (and even the `pretty horses') and the charisma of Matt Damon will be enough to keep your interest at peak levels for the duration of the film. Just be forewarned, though: movies don't get much more soporific than `All the Pretty Horses.' My advice is to keep a pillow handy.",500,0,,0,No reference

I guess if you're a fan of the book, simply seeing it come to life in any form is interesting, but for the rest of us....what a snooze-fest! The four hobbits have practically interchangeable personalities, (except that one of them is quieter than the others and looks like Winona Ryder), the crown prince and that other tall guy on the quest look identical, and the whole thing takes itself SO SERIOUSLY! The story becomes tiresome because it's the same predicament playing out over and over and over, (""We're in trouble!"" / ""Run!""), and you just have to accept that the plot unfolds the way it does because that's how it happened in the book. For instance, at one point Cate Blanchett encourages Elijah Wood to look into a magic mirror that lets him see the future. (Actually, it looks more like some sort of magic birdbath.)

938,1371627,2007-01-09,coolfortheone,Children of Men (2006),10.0,"Happy New Year! I'm hoping 2007 will give us all some great cinema. Not too much though, because I still have not seen all must see movies from 2006. I guess I will have to try and catch up on them now, because man I'm glad I saw Children of Men!

Indeed a hard film to describe but I will do my best. The story takes place in the post apocalyptic future of 2027. Post apocalyptic because for nearly 30 years women have been unable to reproduce and absolutely no one can figure out why. People of the world have lost all hope and civil wars have broken out across the globe. Our protagonist is Theo (Clive Owen) a bitter depressed man with a dark past. He has accepted humanities impending doom and seems content to rot away with the rest of the world. That is until his ex-lover (Julianne Moore) gets him involved with a group of revolutionaries led by Luke whose girlfriend happens to be very pregnant. Obviously this is a huge deal and Theo has plans to escort her to the safety of a top secret scientific facility where research could supply the right people with the answers to save humanity. Unfortunately this task is made much more difficult when the whole worlds a battlefield and few people can be trusted. It sounds depressing, but ""Children of Men"" is really a hopeful and human story of triumph and sacrifice.

Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Harry Potter & the Prizoner of Azkaban), here he establishes himself as a master of his craft. The world he has created here is one of the bleakest, realistic, and fully realized universes in the medium of science fiction. He lets the action unfold using some of the most incredible camera-work I have ever seen. There is a section near the end which has Clive Owen racing through a bullet-ridden battlefield and into a bombed out building to rescue the girl. The 9 minute sequence is done without any takes and it blows my mind how Cuaron pulled it off. The action scenes are as intense and exciting as anything I have seen from a legend like Spielberg (which says a lot, he is me and Mike's favorite director.) ""Children of Men"" is a tour de force of direction.

I know what the skeptics must be thinking know. ""Don't be stupid, I only care about the story!"" Well you are in luck because Children of Men tells it really good. Clive Owen is excellent as Theo, a man who instantly gained my curiosity and sympathy. His transformation from hardened cynic to noble hero is completely believable. Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actresses and I wish she was in this more. There is also the great British actor Sir Michel Caine as Theo's old mentor. He manages to steal all the scenes he is in. The rest of the cast is very effective as well, though I have not seen many of them in other films. No problem though, it is easier to suspend disbelief and be caught up in the story that way. The acting keeps the films emotional center in place saving it from becoming a mere technical exercise. Some viewers may complain about the lack of closure involved in the end but it did not bother me at all. By the time the credits rolled I felt emotionally satisfied while still having much to think about. Like many great works of hard sci-fi, and indeed great films, ambiguity is one of its greatest strengths.

That aside, ""Children of Men"" still remains a heartfelt, unique, and thrilling cinematic experience. Bottom line: One of the best science fiction films in recent times.",620,0,,0,No reference

With some of them it's just a matter of overuse or poor execution -- with others it's a question of just missing the mark altogether.So, for example, we have: *Overdosing with images of skeevy, uncomfortable Girls Gone Wild-style debauchery.* These, along with the accompanying over-the-top more-vapid-than-the-real-thing dialogue from our starring ""Spring Breakers,"" are meant to function as part of the film's ""critique"" of corporate media and youth culture. Except: the fact that they're really not all that different from the actual GGW footage on which they're based means that the futility of this kind of ""critique"" is already established; you can't use sarcasm or irony to shame a culture that doesn't really grasp or care about either (and if the point of critique *is* its own hopelessness, which is entirely possible, then Korine is trying to be too clever by half and needs to just try something else).*(Slightly) nonlinear editing and the use of repetition.* The editing is just nonlinear enough to suggest a trip or two to the art-house, but not nonlinear enough to be actually playing with the idea of narrative: it feels more like affectation than anything else. Yes, some of the uses of repeated dialogue and their juxtaposition with different material verge on the interesting... except that the ""different material"" gets sillier the longer the film goes, which robs this tactic of any potential force.*Is it hallucination or reality... and why should we care?* If the film is meant to take place in a realistic universe, it should have gone differently right from the part where a pair of 90-pound coeds try to rob a restaurant using a hammer and a toy gun, since it is spectacularly unlikely that someone in that situation doesn't call their bluff. Even if we grit our teeth and let that go as ""realism,"" as the cinema verite style it's filmed in seems to want us to, surely the same can't be managed with a final shootout that has a pair of bikini-clad college girls casually blowing away a crew of hardened gangsters. On the other hand, if we take a cue from Alien's line ""it seems like a dream"" that kicks off that final shootout and regard everything afterwards as wish-fulfilment in the style of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, then it makes for pretty dull fare as wish fulfilment. It works in the end neither as a gritty crime drama nor as a hallucinatory commentary on America's nihilistic excess.Worse is that what the film winds up delivering in the final analysis is a Slumming-From-the-Land-of-(Mostly)-White-Privilege tale, none of whose protagonists suffer any really lasting consequence or harm from the choices they make. Just as whatever ""critique"" the film was trying to make of hedonism is quickly lost in the shuffle, so to whatever ""critique"" it was attempting of its characters' world view is undermined by this.

949,1608385,2008-03-18,ThreeSadTigers,Kafka (1991),,"This is a somewhat curious film, attempting to be old-fashioned - in the sense that we have varying strands from an early-twentieth century writer, as well as setting, production design and various visual iconography - yet at the same time striving for a sense of post-modernist reinvention. So, what we end up with is a stunning, self-referential combination of the 'look' (which mixes elements of Carol Reed's The Third Man and Welles' Citizen Kane), with elements of the steam-punk sub-genre of films like Eraserhead, Brazil, Tetsuo: The Iron Man, Barton Fink, etc . The story also concerns itself with the notions of the film-noir, both in terms of characterisation, narrative tension and visual design.So, with Kafka (1991), we not only have the externally referential - of Kafka writing a story, whilst simultaneously involving himself in a real-life plot that will, in turn, become the story he is writing (The Castle) - but also the internal references to Kafka's own biographical history; from his job at the insurance company, to the difficult relationship with his father, and also his failed love affair etc. In the lead role we have one of Britain's most competent actors, Jeremy Irons, who, although never looking exactly like Kafka, does at least manage to embody the quiet, stubborn, meticulous spirit of the writer (or, at least the image that we have of him). His performance is one of complete restraint, far removed from some of his more caricatured performances of recent years, as he offers up a mirrored perspective for the audience; lingering in the background of the scene and simply reacting to what is going on around him (again, a popular device from Kafka's work).Director Steven Soderbergh compliments and visualises the screenplay by Lem Dobbs exceptionally well, drawing on the aforementioned influences in a similar, post-modernistic way to their subsequent 1999 collaboration, The Limey. Soderbergh also offers us a depiction of a crumbling Europe thrown into confusion, creating a fully functioning world, much like Ridley Scott did with Blade Runner - offering us an illustration of the past by way of the future - or a depiction of Europe in decline to rival that of Fassbinder's The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979), von Trier's Europa (1991) and Soderbergh own subsequent film, The Good German (2006). So, whereas most films are content to create, or in this case recreate, early-twentieth century iconography in which the past is as pristine and shockingly brand-new, as if it were created only a yesterday, here we get a past that is dirty, grimy, filled with smoke, fog and dust; in short... totally believable.This is a film the people expect too much coherency from; something that Soderbergh's continual mainstream success has only damaged further. As more and more cinema-goers come to adore films like Oceans 11 (2000), Traffic (2001) and Solaris (2002), they come to Kafka expecting a mainstream Hollywood thriller. Kafka couldn't be further from this. Here is an intelligent film that draws on the audience's understanding of European cinema and, to some extent, Kafka's own literary back-catalogue in order to piece together the film's central mystery. The main reference point is Kafka's book The Castle; here featured as an imposing fortress atop a shadowy hill. Inside, Kafka finds Ian Holm's mad scientist and the film switches to glorious Technicolor. There are also allusions made to The Trail, with Armin Mueller-Stahl's detective doggedly questioning Kafka's whereabouts and the integrity of his 'story' (an important factor within the film's internal struggle), as well as a direct reference to The Metamorphosis and some of the writer's more abstract shorter pieces.Soderbergh and Dobbs aren't concerned with pandering to anyone here; they allow the story to remain, much like Kafka himself, an enigma. The story grips us like film-noir should, and Soderbergh keeps us enthralled with his constantly inventive camera work. This is a perfect film that deals with notions of fact and fiction, dreams and reality. The filmmakers respect our intelligence; they understand that some question can remain unanswered and film can work better as a result of this. Whether or not you believe the story to have taken place entirely in Kafka's head (note how the last shot of the film sees Kafka at his writing desk) or whether you see it as the mirroring of fact and fiction is entirely up to you. With fine support from Theresa Russell, Jeroen Krabbé and Alec Guinness, coupled with an exotic Cliff Martinez score, what we have with Kafka is one of the best and most underrated films of the nineteen nineties.

The ""Fantastic Beasts"" wrapper doesn't wind up nearly as exciting as the world around it. It's a very basic fetch quest type story that merely serves to introduce new characters and places and things; it also serves to dumb-down and grind the interesting stuff to a halt.

Maybe it was studio interference (albeit only for the first film, to re-introduce things in a simple way) or maybe all the good stuff is being saved for later (ugh, world-building).Sorcerer's Stone used a fairly simple plot to build a world, yet it felt like an organic extension of what we were seeing and how it was being shaped and presented to us.

There's also lies, betrayals, blackmailing, extortion, inter-racial romances, all with a comedic flare. There is only one American actor each season with Don Johnson - yes, ""Miami Vice"" Johnson - as a regular in the first one as a real monster of a boss. The second season features a swollen-looking Lindsay Lohan as his character's sister, Lindsay's first series regular role in ten years! Her character is just horrible too, but in fun ways, it's all very entertaining. One casting issue though is a Brit playing ""Daniel's"" American friend ""WIll"", weirdly altering his voice to sound American, rather insulting and not so much funny as grating, so that's a miss.

959,2356194,2012-10-05,DICK STEEL,太極1：從零開始 (2012),10.0,"The first thing that'll jump out at you should you watch the trailer and promotional clips, is the steampunk influences in this martial arts film. But don't let that bother you too much because it's nothing but a large red herring, and something of a gimmick, that added a fun element to the typical story of a zero to hero, only that this Stephen Fung directed film comes in two parts, splitting it down the middle to focus on its protagonist's journey from a nobody to a somebody, surrounded by a village full of highly skilled exponents out to defend their livelihood.The plot is pretty generic and derivative, but thankfully the film has its technical department to thank for, in dressing this up really beautifully, with the story focusing on its countless of different easter eggs to bring on the laughs, or the surprises, that keep on coming in fast and furious fashion. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and has many tongue in cheek moments clearly set to lull the viewer into what would be an anime inspired presentation gone life action, and it worked incredible wonders, even though it's half a story, with the promise of more to come in the sequel (which is already primed for release later this month) for this mixed-genre film.It centers around Yang Lu Chan, played by newcomer Jayden Yuan, who himself is a former world champion in Wushu, likely to follow the footsteps of Jet Li if this film takes off at the box office, given that this is quite the showreel for the young martial artist turned action actor. His character is born with a small horn at his right temple, which is indicative that his is a life blessed with natural kung fu prowess if harnessed correctly, and destined for something great. But he ended up with the rebels fighting an ailing Qing dynasty, before having to flee to the fabled Chen Village, where he is to seek the village chief in order to be imparted a set of Tai-chi inspired martial arts, in order to control and expel the inner injuries he's sustained, threatening his life. And each time he uses his skills, the shorter his lifespan becomes, during this critical stage.But things are never made easy for the protagonist of course, and he gets bullied by Master Chen's daughter Chen Yu Niang (Angelababy), and other skilled exponents all trained in the same arts, which has been decreed never to be taught to outsiders. Most of the film deals with Yang's persistence, at times comical, in wanting to pummel his way to the village and pick up the necessary skills, made easier through his innate ability to pick up skills through observation. The real adversary comes from the external and manifold. There's Eddie Peng as Fang Zijing, a western educated man who finds no love from the Chen Village where he comes from, and is the fiancé of Yu Niang, having put in a crossroads where he's heading a project for the government in building a railway cutting right through the Village. He's slimy, and he's a cad, and it'll be interesting to see how his character develops in the next film. Then there's the threat of the Qing forces combined with the British forces who now find it lucrative to come exploit the Middle Kingdom. And if that's not all, the final scene sees two strangers at the brink of infiltrating the village, primed to lead into the next film.And let's not forget about the steampunk inspired designs of a huge railway builder, which is just the tip of the iceberg on the technical strengths that this film boasts, from visual effects, to sets, to martial arts designed none other than Sammo Hung himself. Angelababy had the stunt team to thank for looking believable as the village chief's highly skilled daughter, fighting with a degree of grace, while Tony Leung Ka Fai's role also had him work with the stunt wires to lift him up the pedestal of one of the movie's greatest combatants, and then some. The playful character introductions throughout the film is something of a highlight as well, as Stephen Fung managed to assemble a variety of legendary actors, directors, and martial arts exponents to pop up as cameo and supporting characters for a scene or two, such as Shu Qi, Andrew Lau, and even Bruce Leung, amongst others, so keep your eyes peeled.Some may dislike Tai Chi Zero for being all over the place, but that is nothing but its primary appeal, and Stephen Fung has assembled a extremely unique piece of martial arts filmmaking, dabbling into the era of silent films for flashbacks, animation for the opening credits and then some, and with a general eye, and aggressive camera work to visually spice up the narrative with a playful look and feel from first person perspectives, to anime and comic book styled fonts that appear either to move the story along, or translate sound effects into a comical visual treat. I'm already all pumped up for the follow up film, since there were many sub story arcs left hanging in the balance, and am reserving my call whether this could possibly be a favourite amongst the year's selection.",875,0,,0,No reference
960,3742233,2018-09-08,ahmetkozan,Yasamayanlar (2018),5.0,"It's easy to make a series, but it's hard to reveal a nice series. Fantastic stories can be nice if handled well but this is as difficult as making a nice series. Especially more difficult to do in Turkey. When I first heard the news about this series, I thought that there would be artificial dialogues and lousy acting. But when I watched the trailer, my expectations were too high. It was a good trailer from what I expected. I watched all the episodes when the series came out. As of the first episode, I liked the dark atmosphere created in the series. We saw Istanbul in a way we had never seen before. When I saw the first episode, I said ""yes"", this time it happened. But unfortunately the series moved on very badly after the second episode.It is good that the story dates back to the Ottoman period, but it is bad that it is based on revenge. A girl turned into a vampire comes to Istanbul for revenge years later. I don't like this script. It's not an attractive scenario for me. I can't say that the series is good except for a few elements. I liked the environment created in the series. In accordance with a story that passes today, but goes beyond time; it is colored with sharp and bright lights and has a misty and mysterious atmosphere. In almost every scene, the use of hot and cold colors is enriched with a lot of visuals. Before I started watching the series I was nervous about the success of the visual effects, but they were quite well practiced. The technical flaws of the directory seemed to be mostly in the editing. In the transitions of the scenes, there were disjointed and confused places in the connections of events. The other thing that bothered me is the characteristics of vampires. Our native vampires are a little different from the vampires we know. The vampires have never used the speed characteristics, or that's not this the speed I understand. Unfortunately, the action scenes was very few. Vampires had a fighting scene, and I don't even want to mention it. You're expecting a big battle between vampires and hunters until you get to the last episode of the series. But there's not even one battle in the series. The final episode has been very big disappointment. Yeah well, I said now will be war. But it's not. All the vampires gave up and ran away. It's really ridiculous. I didn't think it would be so bad.I want to mention about the cast of the series. Although the dialogues are very artificial the acting was above average. Especially Birkan Sokullu was good. I think he fits the vampire role. I couldn't love Kerem Bursin. He seemed very American. He was grinning among other actors. Mia, played by Elçin Sangu, is quite cold and distant character. Apart from the main cast, there is a feeling of artificiality for all the side characters that make up both vampires and hunters. In general, I did not like the cast of the series. Vampires are not convincing. They were making strange noises I've never seen before. The hunters have not been able to catch a tremendously exaggerated and convincing tone. Also, I can say that the sex scene of Kerem Bürsin and Nilperi Sahinkaya, who is a mockery in social media, is quite surreal. Although the series initially excites us as ideas, it is a sloppy production due to the weakness of the performances and the scenario. 5/10",595,0,,0,No reference
961,5047846,2020-06-25,TheMediaGuru24,Daredevil (2015–2018),10.0,"This show is what made me get Netflix, if you love amazing action sequences or just great television this is your cup of tea.Season 1 was fantastic it doesn't start like your typical superhero show and just gets right into it. It has some of the best written characters, they aren't perfect but they try their hardest to do the right thing even if it hurts the people they love. The villain is the second best superhero villain behind Heath Ledgers Joker, Wilson Fisk aka. Kingpin, he is so menacing yet sympathetic in a messed up way. People may end up rooting for the villain that's how likeable and hateable he can be. Actors all do amazing, I can go on all day about how they are perfect for their roles but I won't waste your time. The action is special, no CGI and the action is done by the actors themself most of the time with longer takes then just the typical and boring punch and cut style action. This is what made me want more action like this and less of the boring action we receive in other action or superhero movies.Season 2 has a phenomenal first half with the Punisher introduced, he is an anti-hero who has a messed up complex and tragic backstory. He really steals the show from our protagonist, he even makes our protagonist question what justice is and how it should be done. Well done and well written. The action throughout is an improvement from the first season with more and better choreographed scenes which will leave you with a grin on your face. The second half sadly is a big drop in quality, Elektra is a great addition but the Hand not so much. They are pretty generic and boring but they do give us some impressive action sequences which was great and kept me watching the second season till the end.Season 3 is the best of Daredevil. The black suit is back and Daredevil is more brutal then ever. You should watch defenders before but it isn't a must watch to get it. Kingpin is back and causing more trouble then ever which gives Daredevil a reason to end Kingpin's life. Then there is a completely new villain added which causes more trouble for Daredevil, the mentally unstable Bullseye. This show knows how to make great villains with the exception of the Hand, Bullseye easily is the most hateable villain in the show in a well written way. He feels very real like he should be for this show. The action is even better than both the first two seasons, longer cuts and more action, check out one of the season 3 action scenes and see why they are praised by many people. The final episode is fantastic, all the build up to a satisfying close, not only for the season but the entire show. They probably knew that it was going to be cancelled so I am happy they end it in a way where they could of had a new season or finished the show for good.Overall this show has a lot of highs and very few lows. I wouldn't only recommend this to people who love superhero stuff but to fans of action and great television, check this out and support something that isn't your typical superhero story.",560,0,,0,No reference
962,3080701,2016-05-19,akash_sebastian,Fargo (1996),8.0,"The ordinariness of the characters in this film are so carefully crafted, and if the scenes are carefully analysed in the light of all the information, the characters are really not simple and black/white as they seem. The Coen Brothers, being brought up in Minnesota, critique the Minnesota Nice nature - people with their plain and warm exterior with folksy speaking style, but not so empathetic or well-wishing from within; the characters are as cold and distant as the letters of the film title because the characters are as emotionally isolated as story's vast empty landscape. The accent and snow, the white and distant environment, all these things accentuate the feel of the living conditions and community of northern US. I can't testify to the accuracy of the time and place, but the Coens surely give us an intriguing character study.The film takes quite a few witty jabs at capitalism and consumerism; it explores people's (here, especially Americans') obsession with fast food, television and cars. The realistic dialogues and quirkiness do make the characters stand out, like all Coen Brothers films. Many might say Marge Gunderson is the only character with good morals, but she isn't as pure as she seems. Marge, though an interesting character who defies prescribed gender roles and becomes our lead protagonist (though she enters only after one-third the film), she is as emotionally distant as the rest, as evidenced from her murder-scene inspection and ending ride with one of the kidnappers. Her routine life and by-the-book procedure, combined with her husband's not-so- sophisticated paintings about ducks and the decor of their house, exemplify the fact how they are a regular couple in a consumerist web so blissfully content in their simplicity and mediocrity.Expectation vs what's given to us. From the opening title where it says that this is based on a true story and events are shown as it occurred, a certain expectation is set. The Coens take advantage of this liberty and tell the story in the most unusual but interesting way. But they subvert these expectations by slowly inserting scenes that people couldn't have known (if the events are being shown as they occurred). But this helps us understand the characters much better. (We now know that almost the entire thing is fictional, other than, maybe, the murder that inspired them.) The Coens do this throughout the film. Two other good examples come from the scene where Marge meets her Asian friend from college. Compared to the ways Asians are traditionally portrayed in films, Mike really stood out - not at all a clichéd, accented Asian guy, but an emotionally unstable lonely guy who still stays with his parents in his 30s. And the story he tells Marge about his life, we immediately lap it all up, just like Marge does, not realising that the story had the exact plot details from 'Love Story'. The Coens surely take other such jabs at American pop culture. It's not what you expect from a true-story-based crime thriller. It's not what you expect from a comedy. Coen Brother films never usually fit into a single genre, and the unusual blend of crime and humour makes the film stand out.And without Roger Deakins, the film wouldn't look the way it does. That parking lot scene has been praised and analysed to death by now. And yes, it's a spectacular shot and has so much to say. The acting from everyone in the cast is terrific, especially Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Macy gives us such a unique and memorably loathsome character - an apathetic, selfish and cowardly hypocrite, always maintaining such a cheery facade. But he represents the frustrations felt by the pawns in the capitalist system, rarely able to earn or save much to be financially or emotionally satisfied. Hence, his various schemes to collect enough money, run away and start a new comfortable life.Though just a little less than 100 minutes, the film has been assembled with such attention to detail and innovation that it can be analysed and understood in so many different ways. It's not something that seems so great in the first view itself, but the more you see it or think about it, the more it lingers in your mind. Clever to end the film with the words ""Two more months"", since we know it might be a reference to the end of winter when the snow might melt and reveal the suitcase to a passerby.",748,1,parking lot scence,0,No reference

First of all, let me confess I watched the Rifftrax version of this film. It is a bit of a strange choice for Rifftrax. This, after all, is a drama writ large. It would be like a Rifftrax of Love Story or Terms of Endearment.The next thing to unpack is Seinfeld's Bubble Boy. He haunts this movie as it was such a wonderful parody of this film and circumstance. I spent the entire movie with the phrase ""It's Moors"" stuck in my head. The third unpacking is the cast of the film. You, of course, have John Travolta in short shorts. His real life love interest Diana Hyland who was 18 years his senior, divorcing her husband and unknown to both of them was about to get a tragic fatal disease that would not be out of place in the film itself. She, in a creepish aside, plays his mother in the film. I know I know it shouldn't matter. But like the actor playing Dexter marrying the actress playing his sister it illogically just seems. well creepy. On the plus side, we have Robert Reed, Mr. Brady himself, as the father and a very young PJ Soles as one of the high school kids. Also on the plus side, this really isn't that bad a movie. Though based on a true story it really doesn't tie itself to the true life (and much more depressing) real life escapades. Travolta has a light touch and the film seems to do a nice job humanizing the issues at hand.

Miss Ekberg is also a statue here, towering above most of the cast except for PHILIP CAREY, the handsome male lead who shares one thing in common with Anita--he's a lifeless presence.It's hard to get involved with these characters, especially since the story itself is a murky enough affair with some psycho-babble underpinnings in the convoluted storyline.

974,2009604,2010-08-22,tieman64,L'heure d'été (2008),,"""Summer Hours"" begins, appropriately, with hordes of children running joyfully through a garden. They're on a treasure hunt, following a map written in invisible ink.Director Olivier Assays then introduces us to Helene Berthier, an elderly woman whose children and grandchildren have gathered at her home in rural France. Helene was once romantically linked to a character called Paul, a now dead artist who was renowned for his paintings.Helene's home is filled with both Paul's work (a vast collection of priceless art) and more mundane personal items which nevertheless have tremendous sentimental value. One photograph, for example, features an older generation of Berthiers sitting at a table exactly as the current generation are. As the film unfolds, Assayas lays the groundwork for various heavy themes: the way what we ""treasure"" changes as we age, how art and objects tie people to the past, the relationship between art, globalisation and commerce, the seemingly arbitrary and shifting ""value"" of objects, the question of what defines art and what makes art meaningful, how spaces are ""deterritorialized"" and ""reterritorialized"" under capitalism, how objects transform as they move from space to space etc etc. You might say this is the ""rural"" version of Assayas's ""Demonlover"", ""Clean"" and ""Boarding Gate"", but whilst those films focused on the way humans are stripped, sold, traded and pushed around under techno-capitalism, ""Summer Hours"" focuses almost entirely on man's fluctuating relationship with both inanimate objects and product.Early in the film, Helene reveals the reason for calling a family assembly: she wants to discuss the fate of the family estate after her death. Frederic, Helene's eldest son, is an economist, and is the only family member who wishes (for sentimental reasons) to hold on to the estate and its artwork. Daughter Adrienne (a product designer) and younger son Jeremie (who works for a mega corporation in Shaghai) both want to sell the estate. It's of no value to them, they won't be able to visit it as they work far abroad, and it simply isn't economical to maintain. Frederic doesn't agree with them at first, but gradually the practical needs of commerce infringe on his desire to hold on to the past. Reluctantly he agrees with them. Significantly, Adrienne, the product of a system which destroys the past and sells nostalgic copies, makes tacky ceramic ornaments based on the designs of her uncle. Assayas stresses that the children are all ultra-modern bourgeois, part of a ""new France"" that is beholden to the demands of the global market and that is gradually losing ties with its traditions and heritage. Casual remarks highlight this theme: characters speaking of new companies popping up in their village, once taboo romantic relationships accepted as the norm, the fact that Adrienne lives in two of the citadels of Global Capitalism (New York and Japan), the fact that Jeremie is moving his family to China to better manage a mass production shoe factory and the mention that Jeremie's children will learn English and not speak French (thereby cutting them off from their cultural roots). Ironically, it's the one economist in the family who can't cope with the way his family, culture and historical treasure trove are being torn apart. Frederic frequently states that he believes the ""economy as a functional system"" is a myth. He recognises that economism is the new global religion, in which the world is reordered in the service of irrational and incessant growth. The dominant theology of this religion is neo-liberalism, which aims to make the whole world a single market, national boundaries no longer a factor in economic affairs. Unlike most religions, economism looks to growth for salvation, salvation being ""freedom"" from poverty and the ills that accompany it. When it is pointed out that the ""new religion"" has not in fact done much toward reducing poverty, believers are told that they must be more faithful to the precepts of the religion. Of course while the believers wait, the machine's greed outgrows the capacity of the real economy to satisfy. In response, the great centres of finance get the governments of the world to make available to them, by privatisation, all of their possessions. But still this does not suffice! How could it? Debt based Ponzi schemes cannot be satiated. And so the market becomes increasingly abstract, debts ignored or traded as ""value"" whilst virtual economies balloon to something like five times the size of the ""real"" economy. The end result is the world Assayas' characters find themselves in: groundless and always moving to keep the whole sham from collapsing.In one scene, Frederic proudly displays paintings for his children, telling them that one day the collection will be all theirs. But though his kids look up at the artwork with indifference, implying that they are ""cut off"" from the ""treasures of the past"", Assayas is careful to show that Frederic is himself deluded, unable to look upon the pictures without bias. His pleasure is clearly less about the aesthetic qualities of art/past, than it is about family legacy, memory and the continuation of a family history. His children, able to look at the paintings without bias, simply dismiss them as old-fashioned. The result is that the film manages to mourns the obliteration/repackaging of the past whilst also questioning if anything is really being lost. Does the worth of an object reside only in the historical and familial remembrances of concerned individuals?The film ends with a sequence which mirrors its first shot. Here Helene's granddaughter looks on at the abandoned family home, trying but failing to position her body such that it recreates a ""painting of the place"" that Paul once did. It's a deeply sad ending; no longer connected by shared place or possessions, the modern subject is both adrift and defined by loss. 8.9/10 – A great film, though perhaps too word oriented.",970,0,,0,No reference
975,1721280,2008-11-07,Pontyfract,High School Musical 3 (2008),8.0,"I regard the High School Musical series with affection - of course this is not about edgy, hard-hitting cinema, but if you want a feel-good musical with great songs and a certain kitsch element, then it delivers. Those who criticise High School Musical for being too rosy or too tween simply need to face up to the reality that this is a Disney film, and as such is going to have a very different style to Footloose or Grease.So to the third film: I think it was great. Whereas the franchise somewhat lost its way with HSM2, this latest addition is arguably better than the original. All of the actors have come a long way, but it is Zac Efron, playing Troy, who really stands out. His acting is improved, and the dancing is less awkward than was seen in the earlier movies. Opposite him, Vanessa Hudgens struggles to reach the same standard - her voice is a little too nasal and her characterisation too bland to really make the audience care about her story.The supporting cast varied in strength - the character of Sharpay Evans had very little development, and I found Ashley Tisdale's acting forced and irritating at times. However, the voice and talent of her sidekick brother - played by Lucas Grabeel - shone through. Yet again, I felt like we could have seen more of Monique Coleman and Corbin Bleu, as their stories remain a mystery.In terms of the songs, there are a couple of great numbers: the opening Now or Never is catchy and sets the tone of the movie, and whereas none of the slow numbers are especially memorable when you first leave the cinema, they do grow on you if you play them back. The Boys are Back, A Night to Remember, and I Want it All are the standout tracks for me.All in all, this third instalment more than did justice to the first film. I hope Disney leave the franchise at that, rather than trying to create an HSM4 with the new, identikit characters they introduced in this film, who left me cold. As I said, if you want edgy, adult drama then HSM3 will not be for you - but as musicals go, this is a hell of a lot of fun.",382,0,,0,No reference

A lot of clever practical effect work (including a huge model) went into creating the titular monster and it works well, both in the flying and the walking scenes (although the critter's consent 'roaring' detracts from the overall effect (e.g. much less effective the chittery sounds the giant ants made in ""Them"", 1954)).

After putting away a mob boss, Harry becomes a media hero. His superiors decide to take advantage of this to promote the image of the department. Harry is partnered with Al Quain and together they investigate the murder of Johnny Squares (Jim Carrey). Discovering that he was on a list called 'The Dead Pool', Harry digs deeper and discovers that the director of Squares' last film, Peter Swain (Liam Neeson), was playing the game. And that Squares' name popped up on his list. Not before long, Harry's name appears on the list.Director Buddy Van Horn, who appeared as the suicide jumper in Dirty Harry (1971), has gone for all out parody of the character. And it works. Eastwood places his tongue firmly in his cheek, and the action is staged very well. In many ways, it's like a greatest hits collection: the one liners, the 44. Magnum, the fights with superiors, the partner and the steel look.
However, the violence of the movie is more slasher movie oriented and sometimes the film becomes confused as to what it is: a parody, an action movie or a slasher movie. It does not suit Dirty Harry.On the whole, I enjoyed this as a no brainer. Quite sad when you think about it, because Dirty Harry was born with serious intentions, but that's Warner Brothers for you.I give The Dead Pool an 8 out of 10.",252,0,,0,No reference
985,2639633,2014-04-04,JohnWelles,The Lego Movie (2014),8.0,"""The Lego Movie"", directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is a 3D animated film that exists in a world created out of Lego. This Danish company, 65 years old, is an iconic favourite and perennial feature of the children's toy market. This might be a reason for cynicism, fears of a 100 minute advertisement perhaps well founded. However, instead, it is a clever, sly subversive comedy that keeps the innate charm of the toy, while having fun at mocking business and a consumerist society of uniformity. The animation style is slightly clunky, replicating with striking fidelity the limited articulation of the original figures and the almost stop-motion quality aesthetic of the world created. The computer generated imagery is extraordinary in mirroring the plastic blocks' texture and helping make the Lego city a wonder of imagined production design.This would all be without point though, if it were not for a very witty and humorous script, written by the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. They gleefully send-up the corporate world and the Lego brand's film tie-in ranges such as Star Wars and D.C. superheroes. They're ably abetted by a talented vocal cast, featuring Chris Pratt, Will Ferrel, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and a whole host of guest voices, from Jonah Hill to Billy Dee Williams. The jokes range from popular culture to very specific references to past Lego ranges, slapstick to in-jokes, satire to one-liners, in a melange designed to appeal to all ages. Lord and Miller know well that the finest children's movies are ones that attract adults as well, and here they achieve their goal with aplomb.Still, the film never quite avoids a sentimental, good-intentioned moral which so many films of this genre are saddled with. Its plot twist, influenced by ""The Matrix"" (1999), whilst initially surprising and amusing does eventually lose some of its ingenuity. Some of the action scenes go on far too long, excessive demonstrations of versatility that are never as fun as just the pure moments of comedy. The script eventually has to resolve the conflicts it sets up, leading to a slightly weaker second half overall.Yet this is never enough to sour ""The Lego Movie"", which, on the contrary, is mainly a delight, always funny and far cleverer than any movie based on a children's toy has any right to be.",388,0,,0,No reference

This is a film about two real, intelligent, attractive and sincere people who meet on a European train and agree to spend a night walking around Vienna together. What unfolds is a film so obviously important to both the actors and director, that captures the rare magic of two people falling in love.What makes this film special - aside from the beautiful shots of Vienna, and the superb acting of both Delpy and Hawke - is that it consists of a series of conversations that are interesting without being self-important. Both characters are imperfect, and have a believable mixture of realism and naivety. While the film may sound like a boring chick flick, it is anything but.Director Linklater manages to create a movie that allows viewers to feel like they are right there with Jesse and Celine, falling in love at the same time.

A superb performance from Steve Carrell who in addition to being nearly unrecognizable has a very creepy screen presence throughout. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are good as well but didn't really exceed other dramas I've seen them in.The wrestling scenes looked great and you could tell they trained hard to get them looking right. This seems like a small detail but when it's done well it really adds to the immersion.There's not a lot to the story but the way its shot and the dark tone it invokes really raises it up from being a simple character study.

Are we so desperate to see men of the cloth becoming immune to bullets? When I first heard of it, I thought it was the name of one of those spoof movies you hear on The Simpson's - 'Rainier Wolfcastle is McBain in 'Bulletproof Monk'.. the Habit dies hard'.
Anyway, enough of me slagging off the title, because I can't wait to rip into this film.Bulletproof Monk is as ridiculous as the title suggests. It's plain stupid, and not even in an endearing way. I recently saw Shanghai Knights which carries similar plot-lines. I think this film is a Shanghai Knights wannabe, unfortunately though, Sean William Scott is about ten leagues below the 'funniest-guy-in-movies-right-now' Owen Wilson, and Chow Yun Fat is nothing next to Jackie Chan. Wilson and Chan had warmth and you could tell they liked each other, Shanghai Knights is a buddy movie that works. Bulletproof Monk is a classic example of one that doesn't. William Scott, so memorable as Stifler in American Pie, is lost without Jim, Nadia, Oz and the crew. His pranking around is funny for five minutes, but it quickly becomes annoying. And as for Chow Yun Fat, can we not get a guy who has a basic grasp of English? His accent was as anally painful as William Scott's jokes. Jamie King, as the token female, is quite good, but her character is confusing and her motives unclear.If this movie is meant as a 'vehicle' for these two 'stars', then the vehicle was in desperate need of assistance 15 minutes in and unfortunately no one had a AAA card. It broke down a rusted before our eyes for the next 90 minutes.On to the plot....well, we all know films like this have a thread-bare plot anyway, and this is no different. But whereas bad plots can be made good by decent acting and charming leading stars, this one isn't. It falls flat and just looks stupid.I get the impression that the film was heavily, and badly, edited. I mean, that climactic battle went way too quick, there was no tension, a load of monks strung up in some really weird underground lair ready for torture, tattoos flying around, scenes jumping from place to place...UGH! It was just horrible film making. How anyone could find enjoyment in this tripe is waaaay beyond me.A ridiculous story, poor acting and even poorer editing make this one of 2003's turkey's. Some cool fights and two or three witty lines don't save it.I give it two stars. One for the movie, and an extra for the absolutely stunningly beautiful Jamie King.",452,0,,0,No reference
993,1589758,2008-02-16,bludgeoner86,DOA: Dead or Alive (2006),5.0,"I didn't have high expectations going into this movie and after seeing it, it's not as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn't good either. What DOA amounts to is going through a fast paced buzzsaw full of over the top style and flash. As a video game movie they pretty much mess up a lot of things about the DOA universe but even if it weren't related to a video game this film would still be pretty lackluster.The movie begins by introducing Kasumi played by Devon Aoki. We quickly find why she didn't say anything when she played Miho in Sin City. Her acting is laughably bad. To top off this awkward introduction she leaps out of a castle and deploys a mini hang glider in a very WTF moment. She then receives a DOA invite and it recaps who she is. This trend continues for Tina, and Christie to the point it becomes monotonous So after all is said and done they take a plane to an island which they need to parachute into to participate in the DOA tournament to win ten million dollars. But all is not what it seems as a conspiracy unravels. The story is pretty sub par, and the action is over the top, not to mention there's probably a fight every two seconds.However, I will say that the film did become slightly interesting in the second half. The story, shifts focus from a DOA tournament to a rescue mission, though it might as well have been the same because they're just fighting like they always do. Mainly the characters actions and relationships that form make the film more interesting towards the end than it was at the beginning.Since this is a movie based on a video game I thought I'd compare how some of the characters in the movie compare to the game. The characters in the movie are adequately likable, but my favorite characters from the game weren't my favorite in this movie and my least favorite characters from the game became likable in the movie. I thought Kasumi wasn't anything to write home about, and even though she seemingly seems to be the main character there isn't a lot of her incorporated into the movie. Tina is OK, she's neither here nor there. Holly Valance doesn't seem right as Christie (she doesn't look good as a blonde or whatever they did with her hair) but she seems to be the main focus of the movie.Leon looks more like Bryan Fury from the Tekken series more than he does Leon from DOA. Bayman acts like a total idiot. Characters like Lei-Fang (my favorite) have a minimal role in the movie (which is OK because the actress they chose for her looks like Tengu). Also Gen-Fu and Brad Wong are in the movie for a flash second and although the credits say Hitomi is in the movie I don't recall seeing her. Hayabusa seems to fear women, but is somewhat likable. Hayate is a master of acupuncture but I never liked him in the game anyway. Bass I had no beef with but had to be in it I suppose. The film also needed to create roles for characters who aren't actually in the game like Max (lame), Weatherby (kind of liked him), and Donovan (the ultimate badass villain).I'm not a big fan of Zack in the game but he is kind of cool in this movie. He is a little humorous plus I thought he had some cool hair. The character who stole the show for me was Helena. I was never a fan of her character in the games but though she was the best in this movie. They did screw up her character by not making her French but she has enough good looks and charisma to make the film watchable. The accuracy of how the characters related to their game counterparts wasn't an issue for me. I didn't anticipate they would get something like it correct so I let the film makers have a pass on that issue.Another thing that caught my eye is the way the movie looked. The environments and sets were interesting and beautiful. The camera work and shots selection was pretty interesting. The movie is shot pretty well even if everything else in the movie is sub par It has Ultraviolet syndrome, but DOA is more enjoyable than that film. If the cinematography wasn't interesting this film would probably be a complete loss.All in all DOA is pretty ridiculous, it's not the best movie, its not the worst movie, but it is watchable... somewhat.

It tells the real-life story of Dorothy Day, who founded the ""Catholic Worker"" newspaper and relief agency for the poor in New York City during the Depression.  Moira Kelly gives a very good performance as Day.  The story follows her quest to find her way in life, ultimately leading to her helping thousands of people and providing a role model for activists.The film contains a scene where Kelly says one of the most quotable lines ever: ""If you feed the poor, you're called a saint.  If you ask why they're poor, you're called a Communist.""  Kelly says this during a scene when she is responding to people who resist her search for the truth through her newspaper.  Americans who are concerned with political freedom and justice should keep this statement in mind - it is especially salient today.That said, there are flaws in ""Entertaining Angels.""  Kelly's performance as the younger Dorothy Day is great, but in the film Day is supposed gradually to look older, and this aging process isn't convincing.  Martin Sheen also has a part as a wandering, Christ-like, populist preacher.  He's OK here, but his Inspector Clouseau-like French accent won't be on his career retrospective videotape.  Also, the film might have bitten off more than it can chew.  It could have used a bigger budget and a more professional cast.Overall, though, this one is well worth a rental.

1003,2324970,2012-07-27,claudio_carvalho,Creepshow 2 (1987),7.0,"""Creepshow 2"" is divided in three stories, conducted by a leading segment where a boy that loves the horror comic book Creepshow buys seeds of carnivorous plant and is bullied by four teenagers. Meanwhile the Creep tells the tales of Creepshow:(1) ""Old Chief Wood'nhead"" - The elders Ray (George Kennedy) and Martha Spruce (Dorothy Lamour) have lived their whole life and raised their family with their small store in an Arizona town. Now the town is economically decadent and Ray gives credit to his costumers including the Indians of Ben Whitemoon's tribe. When Ray is repairing the wooden statue of an old chief in the front door, Ben (Frank Salsedo) arrives and asks him to keep the jewels of his tribe as a guarantee for their debts. However, Ben's nephew Sam (Holt McCallany) unexpectedly arrives with two other punks to steal Ray, and he kills the elders. They expect to travel to Hollywood, but the Old Chief Wood'nhead will not let them go.This segment is the best one, with a heartbreaking and gore tale of justice and revenge. My vote is eight.(2) ""The Raft"" - The teenagers Deke (Paul Satterfield) and Randy (Daniel Beer) travel with Laverne (Jeremy Green) and Rachel (Page Hannah) to a lake expecting to smoke weed, swim and get laid. They swim to a raft that is floating in the middle of the lake, but they discover a carnivorous blob in the lake that is hungry.This segment is silly but the conclusion is very funny. Daryl Hannah's red haired sister is gorgeous but has a minor participation in the story. My vote is six.(3) ""The Hitchhiker"" - In Maine, the unfaithful Annie Lansing (Lois Chiles) stays too long having sex with her escort and is late to meet her husband at home. She drives her Mercedes Bens in a hurry and loses control on the road. Annie runs over a hitchhiker, but she does not help the man and hit-and-run, questioning whether she can live with the situation. She discovers that the hitchhiker will not leave her.This is the creepiest segment, with a cameo of Stephen King in the role of a truck driver. Would Annie's conscience or the hitchhiker be haunting Annie? My vote is seven.I regret that only three films have been released for this entertaining series.

'Murder' is a filmed play with all the theatrical gestures & conventions intact. The plot is rudimentary (pretty girl on a murder charge) & there are enough holes to fill up Albert Hall (the trial doesn't fill you with much respect for the British judicial system). In its defence I can say that making the movie overly theatrical is supposed to reflect its mileu - a theatre company. The movie also has a pretty strong gay subtext & for many of the major characters we don't know where they stand, & whether that has anything to do with the motives.

The best touch of the movie is its ending where the murderer is uncovered. A brilliant touch which, alas, can't redeem the previous 90 minutes.",170,0,,0,No reference

This is one of those stories that makes you want to be a better person.  Although there is an abundance of predictable moments, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't include every crappy part of reality.  Movies are a form of escape and this one shows us what we CAN be, not what is expected of us.  Mandy Moore really pulled off the role.  Although she has natural beauty, she was never ""made over.""  It is obvious that she is never overloaded with make-up and Landon falls in love with who she is, not how she looks.  I was pleasantly surprised by her acting ability, I saw Jamie on the screen, not Mandy.  Also, I've been a fan of Shane West since ""Once and Again"" began and have been waiting for someone to give him a great role for him to show off his amazing talent and versatility.  From beginning to end he completely transforms as a character and I can't wait to see what role he'll take on next!  This is sure to be a springboard for leading roles in major movies for Shane.  ""A Walk to Remember"" takes us back to a time when movies were what you WANTED life to be, not what it WAS.

That is Leone's most well knownwestern with everyone.  After watching this movie, I couldn't decidewhich movie is better.  I've come to the conclusion that they areboth great in their own terms.  The first movie is more of an actionwestern.  This is an opera. The performances by Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson are by far their best in this genre.  It's great that Fonda decided to be a badguy in this film.  Bronson's mysterious image is a lot like ClintEastwood's Man With No Name.  Claudia Cardinale is veryattractive (for back then).  She is pretty good as the woman on herown that can't make it without help.  Jason Robards is pretty goodas Cheyenne.  I enjoyed seeing western greats Jack Elam andWoody Strode in the beginning of the film.  What if Eastwood, LeeVan Cleef, and Eli Wallach were in the opening, or were the starsof the film?  I was also surprised by the performance of GabrieleFerzetti as Morton.  Morton was a great character, one that I'venever seen before in a western.

1013,1804138,2009-05-15,jonathanruano,5ive Girls (2006),5.0,"Writer-director Warren Sonoda's ""5ive girls"" has an intriguing premise. Five ""bad"" girls, led by Alex (Jennifer Millar) and the lesbian Mara (Jennifer Madley), are sent to a reformatory, where presumably they are going to be turned into good girls. But instead, they are subjected to bizarre and often sadistic treatment at the hands of head mistress Miss Pierce (Amy Lalonde). Along the way, they also learn Latin, discover a ghost and eventually realize that they are intended victims of a diabolical plot.Sounds interesting, but the problem is that there is no pay off at the end. Watching all these twists and turns and the clues along the way, you would think the film's dark secret would be complex, shocking and intellectually satisfying. But it wasn't. The ending turned out to be a real cop out -- and a very boring one at that -- as the film went from being a mystery with fascinating possibilities to a simple action/horror flick with the familiar blood and gore and nudity.This failing would not have been as important, if we actually sympathized with the five girls in this picture. Unfortunately, one is not really given a good reason to care whether they live or die. The script is probably to blame in part for our indifference, though the poor performances were an important reason too. Ron Perlman's Father Drake is probably the best thing in this picture, but sadly we do not see much of him. So the film ends up being dominated by actors who we could not care less about.Finally, the violence does not seem justified in this picture. It seems to be there solely for shock value and perhaps reflects the director's futile hope that nudity, blood and gore will be confused with quality viewing. He is sorely mistaken.",299,0,,0,No reference

U.K. release: 26 March 1956. Australian release: 11 April 1956. Sydney opening at the St James. 9,011 feet. 100 minutes. SYNOPSIS: Refusing to marry her aged suitor, a duke's ward flees to the king.NOTES: M-G-M embarked on a movie version of Sir Walter Scott's ""Ivanhoe"" in 1952. This marked the first time any Scott novel had been filmed since way back in 1923. The enormous box-office success of the new ""Ivanhoe: prompted M-G-M to follow up with ""Quentin Durward"". Both these films were directed by super-fast, economy- conscious Richard Thorpe, who also turned his hand to M-G-M's first CinemaScope production, ""Knights of the Round Table"" (1953). These three movies all share two other features — they were all lensed in England and all starred Robert Taylor.COMMENT: Knighthood is indeed in full flower in this handsomely produced, energetically directed adaptation of Sir Walter Scott's classic novel of a Scottish swordsman's adventures at the French court. Mind you, Robert Taylor is certainly no Scot, but he plays the role with such dash and finesse, it really doesn't matter that his accent is all wrong for the part. And he's helped out by a truly wonderful support cast, including the lovely, high-spirited yet suitably vulnerable Kay Kendall in an ideal role, and Robert Morley perfectly at home as the crafty king. Except for one unfortunate scene (the rape of the monastery), director Richard Thorpe and screenwriter Robert Ardrey keep a nice balance between adventure and comedy. With the exception of this one scene, the film maintains the right flavor of derring-do and then comes to a fine action climax in a blazing bell-tower.

He lures the best friends into a silo, shows them the VHS footage, then mic drops.

1021,2987824,2015-12-14,courtneyr90,The Blind Side (2009),9.0,"The Blind Side directed by John Lee Hancock is a film based off of a true story of the famous NFL football player Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron. The plot of this film is about a young underprivileged black boy that has an amazing talent playing football, but is extremely uneducated. He ends up going to a school where, the Tuohy's, a wealthy white Christian family take him in and become his legal guardians. Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) and their family face many challenges with adopting Michael. Throughout this movie Michael and the Tuohy's are faced with many different obstacles, from social acceptance to overcoming emotional hardships. From watching this film a common theme has presented itself through the storyline. The main theme in this movie would be to not judge a book by its cover. The first major indicator of the theme in this film would be Michael being judged from his appearance that he is good at sports. Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon) pushes for Michael's application to be accepted into Wingate Christian School because he assumes because of Michael's appearance he will be good at sports. While Michael has the physical ability to play the sports, he lacks the emotional and mental ability. Throughout this film Michael is coached to become a better football player. A second indicator of the theme in this film would be Michael being judged from all of his teachers in the school. They assume that he is worthless and unable to learn because he hasn't had a stable upbringing to where he had the opportunity to become educated. One of the instructors Mrs. Boswell (Kim Dickens) can see the potential in him, so she works closely with him to get his grades up to be able to play sports in school. Lastly Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy being accused of taking Michael in for their own benefits. On the outside it may seem like they took him in to build him up to be a good football player to benefit their college, but throughout the film it shows the emotional bond that the Tuohy's and Michael have created. From an outside perspective it may look like the Touhy's adopted Michael for their personal gain, but the film shows the whole story of the emotional bond that they have created. In this film there are a few techniques that contribute to the theme. The first being when Burt is talking to the man that brought Michael to the school there are parallel cuts between that conversation and Michael playing basketball. This gives the viewer the indication that Michael is good at sports and that he will fit in at Wingate. Going back to the theme this scene strongly identifies with the theme that you can't judge a book by its cover. A second indication of the theme through techniques would be in the scene that Michael is being interrogated by Investigator Granger (Sharon Morris). The technique that is being used in this scene would be the high angle shots and low angle shots. In the clips with Michael it was filmed with high angle shots and Investigator Granger was filmed with low angle shots. The high angle shot dwarfs Michael and makes him appear smaller and more like a victim, while the low angle shot makes Investigator Granger seem larger and extremely intimidating. In this scene she is trying to bully Michael into saying that the Tuohy's adopted him for their benefits, which ties back into the theme that you can't judge a book by its cover. Overall this movie is a good film with a strong theme. I would recommend to watch if you like sports movies with a little more emotion behind them, such as Remember the Titans. Judging a book by its cover is very strong in both of these films and it is prominent throughout the films.",654,0,,0,No reference

Do you know the feeling though when you're positivity surprised? It doesn't happen too often right? Well this film is a perfect example of that. It's rear but it happens. The first bad omen was the director: Steven Brill, who was known thus far for directing 2 Adam Sandler films, that let's admit were just plain bad. Mr. Deeds was horrible and Little Nicky would still have been the same even without a director. Oh and he wrote the scripts. It's been 7 years since he's made a film so he's had time to work on a good film. The other bad omen was that the studio, probably for monetary reasons only opened the film in select theaters and sent it straight to VOD Knowing the people playing in the film, this could only mean one thing they didn't trust in its success and if they didn't why would we right? Let's talk a bit about the story Megan Miles the news anchor for KZL is up for a big promotion to go national. She goes to the interview where she does well and she has a good chance at the job so all seems to be going well for our little star well no.

Her friends arrive to pull her from her pity party and get her to go out drinking with them. On a whim she decides to get rip roaring drunk and ends up going home with the bartender. The always cute James Marsden. When she wakes up in the wee hours of the morning while trying to book it from the strangers apartment, she can't find her phone so she uses his to listen to her messages and finds out she may still have a chance at the job if she can do today's news cast without a hitch. Of course this isn't as easy as it sounds 'cause to be lost in quote un quote hood of Los Angeles with no car, no phone and no money and get downtown to the studio is not easy but all the more funny. Walk of Shame isn't a new concept. We've seen films like this before but that's not a bad thing. Hollywood right now is chocked full with the spirit of remakes right now. Despite that this film really works cause the devil is in the details. It works for two reasons. The actors and especially Elisabeth Banks and the well written script, but I still have to say none of them are perfect. Some of the actors like the girlfriends are downright annoying and the script has some plot holes but all in all its pretty entertaining.

The biggest problem is that the films arc is a downward slope. From the first news segments to Megan's first escape from the cops we are drawn in and laughing and keep doing so as we meet her new friends in the hood but somewhere around the middle of the film the humor starts to dry up and we reach totally drought by the end of the film. Even if the story wasn't the most original it only really caused a problem at the end of the film, where it was just really typical, but by then I was at least entertained for a while. It was a surprisingly okay, even if not a to original comedy. It was definitely a positive experience to finally see a film without fart or shitting in sinks and bathtubs jokes, without Melissa McCarthy and Adam Sandler. I think this type of comedy is better, while being a lot less disgusting. I was surprisingly entertained so I give it a 7/10. https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1",675,0,,0,No reference

This short film sees the character of Bertha Mason, locked in her attic by Mr Rochester and singing a song about how she occupies her time. I do not know a great deal about fanfiction and fandom or whatever the proper words are, but I can appreciate a funny film which takes a character and does something clever with it. In this case we join Bertha in her attic as she sings about her day – tea, matches, looking out windows, tearing dresses – and, of course, nest.The tone of the film is wonderfully upbeat and cheerful, and this immediately sets the humor as it flies in the face of what we actually know about the character. The song is catchy and the dialogue smart – with great delivery from Persaud in the lone role. She has very nice comic touches throughout – with the skull flirting and random ""nest"" getting good laughs among many other good chuckles. Her bright performance and the bright music work well together and the film is well shot in the location, giving it a good look.I have read that you have to be a fan of Jayne Eyre to really appreciate it, and perhaps that is true, but even with my very basic awareness of the characters, I still found it clever and funny (although ironically for someone who consumes as much media as I do, the thing I didn't know till reading the description afterwards, was that the song came from the film Tangled).",279,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

In recent years that portmanteau Diaries series uses Girlfriends Films' ""Twisted Passions"" videos set at the notorious Lamoyne Hotel for its content instead.Unfolding in soap opera format, the seductions and romantic dramas of both players and coaches constitute the starting point for this narrative. We have buxom Victoria Valentine coercing young Leah Livingston into having sex for her, the price to pay for admission to U.T., and also to get chosen for the softball squad. Watching this decade-old DVD I was intrigued by the parallel, porn-style, to the present-day spectacle of what folks thought they had to get into elite universities, including the corruption of sports faculty.Dana DeArmond is similarly manipulative as a senior to get her claws on petite high schooler MIa Leigh, and the pattern is set for future installments.Lovely Sam Ryan, one of the best actresses in the Girlfriends universe, gets to chow down with the very sexy Jolean in a vignette that cries out for pirating some Dolly Parton music on the soundtrack.

The actors do their best with the material and the two female leads come up with pretty good performances but it was edited down to a 12A and there are just too many leaps of imagination needed to complete the film. The storyline is wholly contrived and the explanation for father and daughter coming out of their self-imposed exile is unsatisfactory.

I'll tell you why: because in days gone by people made movies because they were passionate about concocting a great story, and it wasn't just about the bottom line.As every film fan knows, the 70s is chock-a-block with such examples and the Night Visitor is one of them.I often revisit films that I saw in my childhood that have haunted my consciousness ever since. The Night Visitor was one of them. I had these vague memories of watching it many years ago on television. It was a very clever story and so unusual that it stayed with me for YEARS.All I could remember was a man scaling the tall granite walls of a very secure prison located in a cold and forbidding wasteland. But I couldn't for the life of me remember the name of it.Then one day I'm scrolling around on YouTube and there it is, uploaded by another film nut. I was overjoyed. A really nice high-def transfer too. It was like running into an old friend that you haven't seen in years.The story is a real twisty that keeps you watching until the end. It's driven by the wonderful character actor Max von Sydow (who sadly passed away not long ago) with terrific support from Liv Ullman and Trevor Howard.It's a murder mystery but not quite like anything you've ever seen. Beautifully wrought sets and a fantastic atmosphere courtesy of the location among the snow-swept wastelands of Sweden. The twist at the end is the cherry on top of a delicious cinematic feast for the eyes and brain.They simply don't make movies like this anymore.

1038,3227995,2017-02-02,johnny_burnaway,The Home Economics Story (1951),5.0,"There weren't a lot of professional options for women in the mid- 20th century. Occupations that extended beyond ""housewife"" and ""mother"" were more limited than they are today. With the current of social mores flowing so hard in the opposite direction, it took a little extra to sell girls on the idea of going to college. Hence this film, which extols the value of an education in home economics.It would have been quite the progressive leap at the time to tell girls they could be doctors, lawyers, or engineers. A degree in home ec was a safer message, shouting ""You can go to college!"" and whispering ""But your place is in the home, or at least in a kitchen somewhere.""Regardless, this message resonates with our protagonist, Kay, who experiences an epiphany as a representative of (presumably) Iowa State College rhapsodizes about the many opportunities afforded by a home ec major. Thus inspired, Kay takes that boldest of steps and enrolls.We follow Kay and several of her classmates as they earn their degrees in home economics. Highlights include Kay's first big farewell from her emotionally distant parents, avant-garde interpretive dance disguised as a cheerleading routine, and a house full of girls raising a baby purchased on the black market with student activity fees (reviewer's conjecture).In regards to the filming style, I'm a little curious: are the girls in this short actual home ec students who got drafted to appear in the film, or are they members of the university's drama department? Was it shot silently and overdubbed because no one in it could actually act, or was that just cheaper? The answer is lost in the mists of time.Anyway, MST3k have a great time with this one, although the jokes about campus shootings haven't worn well. ""Hey look! It's Lou Costello in drag!"" nearly suffocated me.",305,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

She has to be the worst comedienne of all time! Her racist comments are stereotypical and clichéd, and her over the top performance is not funny in the least. It's insincere and she is always acting like she's trying too hard. The people in the audience at this show must've been on drugs, or something, because this is the worst comedy show ever!Ready for some laughs? Lisa Lampenelli gives a 40 minute long comedy performance of what many call edgy comedy, but what I refer to as stupid. About 65% of her jokes are racial jokes, including talking about the lower extremities of African American men, talking about how cheap Jewish people, are and how prone to violence Mexicans are. How original! I've never heard these bad stereotypes before. 25% of her jokes are gay jokes, where she points out gay guys in the audience, and talks about how Andy Dick may be gay, but he's not a child molester, which leads to the most amusing joke in the show. The rest of her jokes mostly consist of her talking about guys she's dated and guys who want to have sex with her, which doesn't make sense due to her looks or personality.This show did not produce one laugh for me. Lisa maybe should go into a profession where we don't have to listen to or see her, maybe she could be a mentor to the deaf and blind, but I'm sure she would find a way to drive them crazy.Overall, this was awful!

Antoine Lavau (interpreted by Gérard Depardieu) concomitant with his job of supervising the beginning of a great enterprise in an ancient french possession (Argel or Marocco?) searches desperately ""to fix a mistake"" done in his past: the fear of to be repudiated in his avowal of love for Cécile (Catherine Deneuve), in despite of both we're involved in a whirligig passion in a remote summer of '70s (by the way, to her, the first love...). Antoine, now a rich entrepreneur of (construction) line of business meet again Cécile married with a doctor (Natan) born in that place who absolutely doesn't look Cécile as a goddess, like Antoine does. This becomes patent when, in a scene where both talk and Natan confesses that he has several lovers (""of all kind, all nationalities"") and he is bored with his marriage... By her hand, Cécile does not love him anymore as before, because he reveals himself as a ""heman"" or because he treats his own son (Sami) in a careless way, ignoring completely his emotional feelings. In face of this situation, Cécile created a shell around her and this shell is a mixture of feminism and hardness in her relationship, mainly with men. That's obvious when she meets Antoine in a hotel room, after had repudiated him more than once... An accident put them together - same that in a provisory manner - occasion in which they will try to correct, no matter how lately, the ""mistake"" of the past. The interpretations: Gérard Depardieu is not so well as in the other roles, but he transmit us some tenderness while Catherine Deneuve ""ravissante"" (charming) in her 60 years give us an interpretation firm and faithful to psicologic shadows of her character.

Some folks seem blinded in their adulation for Milla Jovovich to really review this movie objectively. Here, let me help you, its a turkey with a capital T. Jovovich does actually make an effort but in this she is alone as the supporting cast are as bland as rice paper. The director must take some responsibility as something more substantial could have been made from the face blindness premise but the direction is pedestrian and as a result the movie lacks any tension or excitement.As in many serial killer/detective/witness combos the witness and detective end up in each others arms but in reference to the aforementioned ""witness"", Harrison Ford and Kelly Mcgillis they ain't. Special mention goes out to Julian McMahon who plays the detective in question as he brings balsa wood acting to a new low level. Forget about Body of Evidence or The Specialist as Faces in the Crowd wins hands down for the unsexiest movie romance ever. There's more chemistry in a test tube. Marianne Faithful is wheeled out from cold storage in the role of some expert on something or other to offer her (stating the obvious) pearls of wisdom to help Milla overcome her affliction.Jovovich's character also has a couple of would you ever date cougar girlfriends, one of whom gets slain by the killer(unfortunately not the ""Chica"" one).

So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a film that has been touted as the British version of La Haine! Well La Haine it is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other British films of late, but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly.The film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in London, but I'm concerned that film makers now use type-casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging.

Lee Marvin did a superb job leading the cast in their tale of teamwork and heroism, and I feel the cast was well selected. Even better, unlike the war movies of today which focus entirely on the battles and killing, The Dirty Dozen spends well over half the film on character development and building the relationships between the cast. And when they finally do get to the fighting it isn't just repetitive waves of enemies that are unrealistically held off by twelve men. Instead it portrays the actual aspects of war where the good guys are human and die. Though only 3 of the group survived, the deaths of the men aren't in vain. Many of them would have died had they refused to take part in the mission, though by dying in battle they gave their lives for their country and earned back the honor they lost through their crimes. The only reason I don't give this a 10 out of 10 is that the story began lagging slightly towards the middle, prior to their part in the war games.

1049,1556391,2007-12-18,wadetaylor,The Black Watch (1929),8.0,"John Ford is in my opinion the greatest director that ever lived, and he rarely ever made a misstep. Many people have listed The Black Watch as a misstep, but in context I do not think that it is. It is true that it is dated in the way that the dialogue is spoken, but find me one sound picture from 1929 that is not.The problem was with sound pictures themselves, the movies had developed into near perfection in 1927-1928. But then sound became all the rage, and it wasn't profitable anymore for the studios to invest in silent movies. So the masterpieces of the late silent era were put on the back burner for stagy dramas with too much dialog or musicals even more stagy than the dramas.The Black Watch has Ford's German expressionism influenced photography that he started in the late twenties after meeting F.W. Murnau. It also has the Ford themes of Integration into a society, self sacrifice, and the bond between men.The one major drawback is the extremely stilted dialogue. No one really understood at the time how sound should be recorded live, which led to really irregular ways of saying lines. With long pauses between each others lines, since they did not want to step on each others' lines, so as to overwork the early microphones.Victor McLaughlin's acting wasn't his best, but he was much better than Myrna Loy who honestly seemed as though she had been hypnotized before going on the set. I thought the guy who asked forforgiveness for his violence towards his fellow man, who would then do something violent was funny.Compared to all of John Ford's other films this is near the bottom, but compared to everything else made in sound in 1929 this is at the top of the heap.",300,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

1051,2034555,2010-10-21,johnnyboyz,Boxcar Bertha (1972),8.0,"Boxcar Bertha is an exciting, daring film set amidst a world falling apart at the very seams, a world in which four people come to lose all respect for law, order and others around them before beginning a spree of thieving and disturbing illegality. The film unfolds in the 1930s amidst Depression era America, with each of the four central characters that come to form the law-breaking quartet, of varying races; genders and classes so as to highlight an as broad-a sense as possible of whom exactly it is the nation's Depression is affecting. One of the members, and the only female one, is the titular harmonica playing Bertha (Hershey); somebody who must suffer the witnessing of her father's death by way of crop duster crash before going on to disturbingly fall in with the wrong crowd. It's established that her father may have been of a disciplinarian sort, a rail road worker commenting that her father wouldn't at all like it if he heard her using the profanities she does when he's up there – his death signals a systematic death of rules and regulations, an additional 'freedom' away from the straight and narrow after which all Hell in her life will break loose. The other predominant member of the troupe is the charismatic Bill Shelly (Carradine), a character we first observe giving a rousing speech to fellow rail road workers about a forming of a union, instilling certain degrees that the man is a leader and has skills in being able to talk to people, or rouse them.Following a run in with a gambler that ends in murder and the hitching up with African-American man Von Morton (Casey) as well as Northern state based businessman Rake Brown (Primus), who's come down with a false accent and an empty wallet to find work when they meet them in the same jail cell, the group go off on an ill-gotten venture of train robberies; law dodging and in the case of Bill and Bertha: sexual relations. The film is an early piece from American film-maker Martin Scorsese, a man who later made some of his best work in the form of exploring the worlds and minds of those either on the fringes of social order and in a state of marginalisation or the criminally infused who were morally vacant and at once so scummy and so putrid that to gaze on at their plights and actions was to do so with a grotesquely pleasing sense towards the craft but the polar opposite towards the people. In relation to this, Boxcar Bertha has more fun with showing characters of a policing sort, in the form of police troopers and so forth, to be of an evil; narrow minded or even racist ilk than it is concerned with trying to have us sympathise as much as possible with the leads and their narcissistic, criminal driven existence. Shelly's early talk from when we first see him has him speak of rising up against authoritarian figures, the company and the system and as the police net on that particular occasion closed in on the band of Unionists we see that the escapades he comes to engage in now is merely an extension of that mentality and that state of living. Shelly's linking up with Bertha in a romantic sense is dealt with amply and pleasingly done; as established, her own ideas or sense of operating under an authoritarian figure in her father whom we're led to assume did his best to keep her on the straight and narrow effectively has her 'rebel' against figures of that nature when he dies - in that there's nobody left with any rules to feed off of. Their connection is preordained by the nature of their attitudes towards these sorts of figures, with Bertha's in relation to her father coincidental as Shelly takes it upon him self to manifest a problem with whatever State figures see otherwise in reaction to his Union idea rallying call. Scorsese nicely documents the four of them banding together as a team, the odd leaf taken from Aurther Penn's book in that his film Bonnie and Clyde from a few years prior to this 1972 effort managed to explore what made the group of law-breaking, bank robbing bandits tick as human beings in between all the chaos, as the media demonised them, without ever really teetering over into glamorisation. A similar sense is applied here, four Robin Hoods robbing from the rich and keeping the loot for themselves set amidst barren, desert locales as a country and its economy come apart at the core with its rotten-minded and unlikeable police force following suit.

1053,4243843,2019-06-14,ReadingFilm,Welcome to Marwen (2018),1.0,"The film follows the manbaby, a sort of catch-all reflection of today's fandom indicting his inability to face reality while exploring its virtues in 'art as trauma'. (The 50-Year Old Virgin.) Actually its judgments are not so intuitive. On the surface, Hollywood pokes fun at its bread and butter while serving it as a cinema experiment in empathy and goodness. Art to trauma. But then art in art is an island of enlightenment, not escape, but living itself (artists sure have a knack for self promotion). Zemeckis is Spielberg-I wouldn't say Diet, we can go with Spielberg-Zero. Don't forget those 80s directors came up as the original nerds. Or a better way to put it, the way they fail is because their exceptional talent isolates them, so the misfires are just as connective but in the way of their peculiarities. This is a recipe for interesting disasters. (The fact he quotes both Biff and the DeLorean, he suddenly flexes: 'I'm a cinematic giant' while in the process tanking its entire integrity.) Meanwhile the film's power fantasy panders to today ignoring such women were very much national socialists themselves. Still in the great in the tradition of R. Crumb as how they show his inferiority complex and starvation for humanity. But wait. The women are real? And both not creeped out at all, but in on it? Some even want to date him? Meaning reality and fantasy are hopelessly codependent. The world will meet us anywhere. We are responsible for each other and impactful in inconceivable ways. See as it contrasts banality to Nazism: as in when fantasy of ideology seeps into our world, the consequences are dire. This is on the opposite curve of his own identity exploration in cross-dressing. Now why this is all interesting is how it presents no psychological distinction--being war hero in toys he is a war hero for real, which forecasts the 21st century virtual identity world war, humanity's original sin in trauma, and trauma itself all inside this whirlpool of 'art'. Trauma leads to art. Collective trauma leads to collective art. Then it's a functional society he creates even tucking them in. ""They hate him because he's different."" But reality is not enough without its second half, being fantasy. Most surprising though is its unity vision, a goodness here craving the fringe to interface: not the experience of living but then, art is living, and cinema is an early iteration of living. (Compare this to how thoroughly it rewrites 2005's The 40 Year Old Virgin; I only bring up due to Carrel and their love of figurines. The one mocks albeit lovingly, the other indulges, does not question for a moment, and allows him to pursue it to its furthest and questionable extent; Zemeckis even there gets on the ground playing with him.) None of this is intuitive or what we expected, as we witness the blockbusters attempt a reading of our time that works within its circular logic, and may only make any sort of sense in hindsight. Still, maybe there's something to the hopeless idealism of Hollywood, where Capra meets the identity age; maybe they know something we don't.

It's strong points are how well it puts you into the universe of star wars. Without impacting on story. The CG is absolutely impeccable, and I swear every other shot is a VFX shot, so big ups to the VFX studio that created all of those shots as they look real as hell.
The way the main character has no face, but yet displays an incredible amount of emotion, makes this series even better, though I do wish the last shot of the whole series was him taking the mask off, cliche, I know, but it would have made a sick ending.
Some of the transitions made me cringe a bit, but most star wars series use these types of transitions, so I can't complain too much.
I must say though, the worst part about this whole show was the acting surprisingly. I'm not saying it was awful, just sometimes instead of a scene being emotional, I would rather think in my head that it was ""well acted"", but acting isn't meant to be noticeable as acting, At least that's what I think.Overall a sick series that anyone and there Grandma should watch86/100 rounded to 9/10Also, Baby Yoda",211,0,,0,No reference
1056,530617,2002-12-17,Cantab04,Die Another Day (2002),,"To start with, I have to say that Die Another Day is certainly an enjoyable film, in a similar way to xXx. However, it falls short of the expectations one has of a James Bond-movie. Of course, the series was always slightly self-ironic, in terms of plot-holes and unbelievable action sequences. But this film matches xXx bit for bit in the stupidity department. It has been described as ""the coolest Bond ever"" by its makers, but if I want THIS sort of coolness, I go and watch Vin Diesel pose as an actor. It has been sexed up (no bad thing, mind), stuffed with even more double entendres, filled with more action - and thus dumbed down in the process. It lacks the sparkle and wit of the earlier Bond movies, and for some reason which I cannot quite put my finger on, it left me feeling unsatisfied. Maybe this is to do with the fact that Bond is on a revenge mission - the saving-the-world-bit is introduced in a casual and almost desultory way. Some of the acting is quite bad as well. Not the regulars: Samantha Bond and John Cleese are as good as always, Judi Dench can do no wrong, and Pierce Brosnan is still able to cut the mustard as the English super-spy. But the ""one-offs"": I always thought of Halle Berry as a great actress, and apparently the Academy agreed. But as Jinx she is absolutely atrocious, looking more like someone in their first week in acting school rather than an Oscar winner. Toby Stephens' villain is way over the top, and the less said about Madonna (although only in a small role), the better. If THIS is supposed to be the Bond for the 21st century, I'll go back to the older films of the series, and stick with Xander Cage as the agent of ""the new generation"". Mind you, there is definitely some enjoyment to be had from watching Die Another Day - some of the one-liners and gags are still quite good (Moneypenny's cyber-experience, for example), but others are very low on wit (""Saved by the bell!""). And over the whole of the movie, the bad parts outweigh the good ones. After this film, Ian Fleming and Albert Broccoli must be spinning in their graves...",383,0,,0,No reference

1059,724120,2004-02-04,Gafke,Vampire Journals (1997 Video),,"I am a huge fan of the Subspecies films, and so it was with much eagerness that I sat down to watch this offshoot of the series.  I have never been so thoroughly disappointed in all my life.The opening credits are great, set in a snowy, eastern European cemetery with moody shots of beautiful headstones.  Sadly however, the credits come to an end and the movie begins.Whiny, self-pitying vampire Zachary is determined to rid the world of his own kind, especially powerful vampire Ash, who has set his sights on Zachary's would be girlfriend, Sofia.  Sofia, a mortal pianist, has no idea what is going on until Ash imprisons her in his mansion.  It is then up to Zachary to save her...because she obviously can't save herself. 
If you thought Brad Pitt as Louis in ""Interview With the Vampire"" was bad, he's got nothing on Zachary, let me tell you.  Zachary slogs through the entire film, sulking and frowning and delivering such poor-me lines as: ""I am Gods most forsaken creature.""  Yeah, well, we all have our problems.  Go sit in the sunlight if you're so miserable, but please spare the rest of us your tragic whining.  Sofia fares no better, klutzily stumbling through her performance and giving us a stiff, weak heroine.  And Master Vampire Ash is ridiculous.  The guy looks like Michael Bolton, which is really the only scary thing about him.  The film moves slower than a three legged constipated turtle, and although the sets are beautiful, they are filled with lifeless (no pun intended) characters that I could not believe in, much less care about.  I kept hoping that Radu would show up and give them all a good smacking-about-the-face, but sadly this was not to be. 
The Subspecies films work for the exact reason that this one does not: Subspecies gives us a strong, unrepentant vampire who never apologizes for what he is and enjoys what he does.  It's easier to hate Radu than it is to like Zachary.  This film gets a 1 on a scale of 10, and the 1 is for the scenery.",351,0,,0,No reference

1061,4603272,2019-12-22,Magow-Intermean,鬼影特攻：以暴制暴 (2019),8.0,"An enigmatic billionaire known only as One (Ryan Reynolds) has faked his own death and gone underground to lead a group of similarly off-the-grid mercenaries to do the jobs that governments won't. Their first mission: deposing the vicious dictator of Turgistan and replacing him with his more peaceful brother (Payman Maadi).
It's become common for directors who have made a movie with Netflix to wax lyrical about the near total freedom that's given to them. While that autonomy can mean we get films like The Irishman from Martin Scorsese, it can also lead to films like Michael Bay's 6 Underground which, with a rumoured budget of $150 million, is on a par with 2017's Netflix tentpole Bright. The latter defied the negative reviews and became a massive hit, and the streaming giant will be hoping that their latest expensive gamble pulls off something similar. For this is Bayhem in its purest form, and that's for the worse instead of the better.
The mercs against the world plot (such as there is one), which is explained over and over and over again despite a lengthy opening car-chase sequence and flashbacks designed to catch us up, is laden with potential. If this were a better movie you could easily see it being the start of a franchise, but the problems start early and pile up almost as quickly as the John Wick-esque body count.
This is Michael Bay at his most irresponsible and gory.There's something to be said for the fact that Bay is such a distinctive auteur that you need only watch the first five minutes of 6 Underground - which has some impressive vehicular moments to boot - to know exactly who's behind the camera. It's just frustrating that that unique visual style goes hand in hand with other elements that are now part and parcel of the Bay experience. From the incoherent editing to the objectification of women to the over-excessive and nasty violence, which is at times perpetrated by the characters we're meant to be rooting for, this is Bay at his most irresponsible and gory.As for the people in front of the camera, it should be no surprise that Reynolds - who is working from a screenplay penned by Deadpool writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick - gets all the best lines, and he remains fun to watch even though we don't learn much about his character as the movie progresses. The rest of One's team fare less well, falling somewhere between the bare minimum of characterisation and, in the case of Adria Arjona's 'Five', absolutely nothing at all. Thankfully, Corey Hawkins infuses his sniper with decency that the movie sorely needs, and Mélanie Laurent seems to know exactly what movie she's in and acts accordingly.
Ultimately, though, 6 Underground will have you asking a ton of questions about many of its bizarre choices, including but not limited to: Why replace the driver on your team with a sniper? Why are the team taking orders from the billionaire even though he's clearly the worst leader of all time? The film is less concerned with answering these than it is in plunging you into the next heavily stylised action sequence. Such is the Bay way.",537,0,,0,No reference

It was obviously filmed by a film student on a budget (the credits at the end give special thanks to Discover, Visa, MasterCard and American Express).  The cell phones used in the movie are the size of bricks, so this must have been filmed in the early '90s, even though the copyright says 2002.The monster looks like it was a rented Halloween monkey costume covered with slime.  The sound and lighting are so bad a camcorder was probably used. Occasionally, the film shifts to the monster's point of view - it looks like the colors are reversed or put in a special filter to show lots of green, red and blue.One of the high school girls is a hot blonde wearing a miniskirt.  I was waiting to see her get eaten by the monster (**SPOILER ALERT**) but it eats her boyfriend instead (his remains look like a mask covered with red paint and raw hamburger).  The monster won't eat the pretty females (maybe it falls in love with them and is killing off the competition?).  The bossy intelligence agency lady certainly has a thing for the monster (the beauty and the beast!) and it tries to communicate with her through growls. When one of her underling robo-cop agents shoots it with an automatic, she gets furious at him for killing it. Or ... is it really dead?The movie is certainly very watchable repeated times in a campy sort of way.

Do not get me wrong, it was by no means horrible; it was a certainly a decent and watchable flick, but I can't help but feel disappointed by it.The acting is solid enough, with Connery giving a very confident and convincing portrayal of 007, and his usual supporting cast at MI6 doing decent jobs as well. Gert Frobe was also quite good as goldfinger. In addition there are some great one-liners, a memorable henchman in Oddjob, the introduction of the fully equipped Aston Martin, a great pre-credits sequence with the explosion and fight at the Caribbean party, and the theme song, performed by Shirley Bassey is one of the best in the entire movie series. Certainly Goldfinger has some of the greatest moments in Bond history, so where does it go wrong?While Goldfinger essentially invented the now standard ""fun"" Bond blueprint that everyone knows and loves (the crazed villain, the cheesy one liners, the tricked out car, the gadgets, the epic battle at the end, Bond bedding girls left and right throughout the picture, etc.), it all feels strangely pedestrian when compared to the later pictures that nailed the crowd-pleaser style of Bond movie. Goldfinger's biggest crime is that it is just rather dull and uninteresting most of the time. Instead of taking the viewer to marvel at some of the most beautiful locations in the world, most of this movie takes place in Kentucky (although Geneva was cool). The fight scenes are mostly clumsy, except for the one in the beginning. Instead of saving the day, Bond basically just sits in jail most of the time and lets other people do the work for him (he did not even defuse the bomb at Fort Knox). Goldfinger is a transition between the earlier Fleming inspired movies, and the later more outrageous ones without having the benefits of either. There is no sense of danger or suspense in the entire movie; mainly because Auric Goldfinger was one of the lamest, and most nonthreatening villains in Bond history, and add to the fact that his motives were vague and unclear, it is easy not to care about the plot of the movie or its outcome. At the same time it lacks the balls of the later flicks that had over the top ninja battles in Volcanoes, or Bond fighting a seven- foot behemoth while falling out of a plane with no parachute. Goldfinger had a mildly exciting car chase, and the likewise somewhat stimulating finale on the jet. There really is not much more to say. Goldfinger is a decent, but highly disappointing Bond flick. I personally found Dr. No to be far more interesting and suspenseful than anything in this movie, and also From Russia With Love ,and You Only Live Twice, and Thunderball, and Live and Let Die, and The Spy Who Loved Me, and Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only, and Octopussy (yes even that one, at least it was more fun and had better action, even if it did have a similar plot) and even Goldeneye (though I thought it was kind of weak too).",543,0,,0,No reference

1078,3381706,2017-09-04,lajospn,I Do... Until I Don't (2017),1.0,"Look, I loved Lake Bell's previous movie ""In a world ..."", it was the perfect romantic comedy, off-beat, funny, and with a heart. In fact, I'm probably in love with Lake Bell because I thought she was the best thing in it: she has this natural vulnerability about her that manifests itself in minor gestures and in those big, expressive eyes. I'm just saying this because, if anything, I'm prejudiced for her, not against her.Anyways, I *wanted* to love this movie, but it's a piece of crap. The insular, middle class environment is literally suffocating. The characters are hateful and empty, without a single redeeming feature (again, except for Lake Bell's Alice).Let's dive in, shall we?Ed Helms can be extremely funny (see The Office), but here, he's just depressing. First, he runs the family business (selling blinds!) into the ground. Not because he gambled away the money (you wish!), but through sheer incompetence. And the sad thing is, he doesn't even seem to mind: he seems as upset about it as you'd be about a clogged toilet (well, probably less). He's bland as sop, has no passions or hobbies, probably stares at drying paint for fun. Which begs the question: why would I care if he wanted a child? I would suggest a vasectomy instead, just to save future generations from his pathetic gene line. Problem is, we, the audience immediately question why on earth would a hot and classy girl, like Lake Bell, settle for this guy? Because he reliably flushes the toilet? Honestly, I was baffled. To top this off, there's zero (and I mean ZERO), chemistry between him and Lake Bell. (And I've probably never seen a less exciting invitation for sex in my life. ""Meet me in the toilet. In 5."" It would be tough for Brad Pitt to pull this off, let alone Ed Helms.)Paul Reiser and Mary Steenburgen's couple was the worst. There's nothing less appealing then people well into their 50s who still haven't found anything in their life to be passionate (or, at least, excited) about. They have money, apparently, but do nothing with it. Theirs is a meaningless existence, where conversation (when not hateful) is as shallow as a puddle. I doubt they'd ever read a book, listen to music, or do anything outside their comfort zone. And because they are so desperately banal (yet, at the same time, judgmental), nobody cares if their marriage survives or not. I would have been thrilled if the lady fell in love with the pool boy, burnt down the house for insurance money, and told her stupid husband where to get off. At least then, something would have happened.And, my Gosh, haven't we had enough cheap hippie jokes already? Who thinks making fun of hippies is original, or fresh? Those guys died out in the 60s, all we have left are some dumb hipsters, and even they are too lame to make fun of anymore. In other words, the hippie couple induced the highest levels of indifference in me: Amber Heard is hot, sure, but she doesn't flash her boobs, so no dice. The black dude seems well-adjusted, happily idling away his days, doing sod-all on daddy's money (and he's sleeping with Amber Heard, so he's got that going for him). Why exactly should I care what happens to them? (And no, they are not even into drugs, despite being sooo hippie: at least that would have given the proceedings a little zest).The 'marriage is dead' plot is artificial, forced, and utterly predictable, which is not a good thing for a movie. I mean, seriously, would anybody in their right mind think for a second that Paul Reiser's character will suddenly say ""Screw this, I'm moving to Albania to herd goats!"" Exactly nobody. We know the score: marriage is NOT dead, damn it, people, don't you understand?! (For humanitarian reasons I will say nothing about the BBC documentary lady.)OK, so what about Lake Bell's Alice? Well, as I mentioned before, she's good (great, in fact), but she's stuck in a terrible movie (of her own making, I know, but still). I think she needs to take more risks next time, blow up the living room, burn things down, let blood cruise through the veins of characters so that they make rush decisions, terrible mistakes, and decide to call it quits, if necessary. In other words, she needs to step up her game, because we're witnessing an Oscar caliber actress wasting her talents on insipid fare, best shown on the Lifetime channel for bored housewives.

1082,3411045,2017-10-11,contact-742-500835,Cat Skin (2017),10.0,"Cat (Jodie Hirst) is a shy photography student at a Brighton college who has a crush on a fellow student named April (Faye Sewell) who finds out that cat has been taking photos of her. However, instead of being upset, April is actually curious and Cat overcomes her shyness asking April out. What follows is the beginning of an authentic romance and a coming of age story between two girls who can't quite be openly happy together in a world that will not let them be.CAT SKIN plays like a tenderer version of BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR, its sex scenes lean more towards love-making and the sexual discovery of the two female leads. This is a romance film, but one we know will have its dark, tragic undertones. We live in a world that for all the advances we have made, each day appears as if we made a leap back when it comes to LGBTQ rights. The film doesn't really go into social justice areas, but it's simply concerned with the purity of love, love that finds any vessel and that cannot be resisted. These stories may not appear to be new, but they are none the less necessary, the love story between Cat and April deserves to be told for there's not many of them out there.Director Daniel Grasskamp tells a modern love story with confidence and thoughtfulness, but also knows how to inject moments of searing pain that break the spell. Hirst and Sewell are terrific together and their chemistry lights up the screen, you root for them to stay together, and fear for them when you know the world won't make it easy for them. Overall, a love story for our times told without the illusions of other films that wrap everything in a bow-tie with easy answers. Love does conquer it all, but all conquests take a toll for all.Review Written by Enrrico Wood Lagonigro - Senior Curator Oaxaca FilmFest.",326,0,,0,No reference

1086,848228,2004-11-01,Smells_Like_Cheese,The Pianist (2002),10.0,"Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10",518,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

1088,2249707,2012-02-17,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Hugo (2011),4.0,"Martin Scorsese crafts a charming love letter to the movies, but unfortunately Hugo has much more on it's mind that just that. At first, this appears to be a relatively simple tale of a young boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) trying to finish the work of his father. It's got a lot of the standard pieces that one would expect from such a tale, like the spunky girl he befriends (Chloe Moretz) and the cartoonish villain trying to lock him away (Sacha Baron Cohen). As a narrative, it wasn't doing much for me, but the astonishing technical achievements within the film made it at least appealing to the senses. So while I wasn't compelled by the story, I was at least able to marvel at the visuals of the film and the remarkable sound design.The stages are exquisite, with some of the most impressive art direction and costume design I've seen from this year, and Scorsese manages to create a fully realized environment here. Hugo lives in a train station, a place of constant activity and daily routines, and Scorsese orchestrates it in such a lively fashion. We are focused on this young boy, but you can always feel a thousand different things happening around him, people walking past and going about their own day. I just wish our focal point had been remotely interesting, which it wasn't for me. I credit a large part of this to the cast, which is primarily lackluster to say the least.Scoresese isn't able to pull a worthwhile performance out of either of his young stars; Asa Butterfield tries to be very grown up and ends up looking like an untalented child poorly playing pretend, while Chloe Moretz is supposed to be very bright and childlike, but is instead dreadfully rigid and wooden. The worst offender though is Sacha Baron Cohen, and it's the attention given to his character that provides for the most glaring flaw in the film at large. This utterly absurd and cartoonish characters doesn't at all belong within this world and Cohen's embarrassingly hammy portrayal is a real stain on the picture.Thankfully though the film is quite uneven overall, which means that there is a lot to be admired. The focus isn't precise at all, but when attention shifts to Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley), the film shines bright. In focusing on this man, Scorsese constructs his love letter to cinema and you can certainly feel his own passion pouring off of the screen within these scenes. Helped by the vivid and emotional performance from Kingsley, this aspect of the film is so very alive and beautiful. Combined with those gorgeous technical qualities and some wonderfully edited sequences (such as the depicting the beginnings of cinema), it's almost like a wonderful dream.Living in the 21st century, I never really think about a time where movies didn't exist, let alone when they weren't relatively available at every corner. Scorsese is able to detail not only his own passion for the cinema, but make the audience understand just how appreciative they should be that it exists in the first place, because there was a time not so long ago when it didn't at all. I just wish that the entire film had been as grand, because everything else certainly didn't come close to the note it built around to. There isn't a proper, organic flow towards this aspect of the film, but I'm still thankful that it went there because it's certainly a step up from the rest of what was going on.",591,0,,0,No reference

1090,3042030,2016-03-12,Tweekums,Ófærð (2015– ),10.0,"This Icelandic series starts in 2008 with a couple of teenaged lovers sneaking into a warehouse for a secret liaison; while they are in there a fire sweeps through the building leaving the girl dead and the boy accused of arson. Cutting back to the present the small town appears to have moved on; then shortly after the arrival of the ferry from Denmark a dismembered body is found. It is suspected that the body was thrown from the ferry. As the local police start their investigation a blizzard starts meaning there is no way for anybody to leave or get into the town. The Danish ferry captain is determined not to have his vessel searched so clearly has something to hide; but is this for other reasons? As the investigation continues a further murder occurs and more suspects come to light; some of them close to home.A few years ago the idea that an Icelandic series would appear on UK television would have seemed unlikely but after the recent popularity of European series, in particular those from Scandinavia it seems perfectly normal. This series is up there with the best of these imports. The story is gripping from start to finish and the snowbound location creates a distinctly claustrophobic feel. New suspects and motives are gradually introduced in a way that keeps one guessing about who is behind the various events. The cast, notably Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, Ilmur Kristjánsdóttir and Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson who play police chief Andri and his deputies Hinrika and Ásgeir, do a great job making the characters feel real. The location and weather add to the atmosphere; the billowing snow in the twilit town is almost enough to make the viewer feel the coldness of the situation. Overall I'd definitely recommend this taut, atmospheric mystery.These comments are based on watching the series in Icelandic with English subtitles.",312,0,,0,No reference
1091,1965116,2010-05-13,BA_Harrison,The Horror Show (1989),5.0,"A vengeful, wisecracking, supernatural killer; a heroic cop with a pretty teenage daughter in peril; several hallucinatory dream sequences; a showdown that takes place in a steamy boiler room; and a finale in which the killer is dragged back into reality before finally being destroyed: with all of these elements, I'm genuinely surprised to find that, as yet, not one of the comments on IMDb have likened The Horror Show (1989) to Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1985).It could all be pure coincidence, of course, but I suspect that producer Sean S. Cunningham, a one-time collaborator of Craven's (they worked together on The Last House on the Left), was a mite jealous of the praise being heaped on the Elm Street director and sought to emulate his old pal's success by ripping him off; the fact that other aspects of House 3 closely resemble another Craven movie, Shocker (also 1989), doesn't help his case much.One thing is for sure: whatever the case, plagiarism or coincidence, The Horror Show was a flop and failed to spawn the franchise it's makers so clearly yearned for. This was no doubt due to the fact that, although competently made with a usually reliable cast (Brion James, Lance Henrikson, Deede Pfeiffer) and some cool gore from effects masters KNB, the film offers very little that genre fans hadn't seen countless times before. All of the clichés are present and correct—the obligatory 'cat leaping from a cupboard' scare, the shower scene, dry ice, a creepy nursery rhyme—and with the more fun moments all having that Elm Street vibe (the talking turkey and Jenke as a stand-up comedian, in particular), there's very little to get excited about.",282,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

The cast is is also. The three main characters (Sheldon, Leonard, and Penny) quickly make you care about them.

The problem with FOUR PISTOLS FOR TRINITY is the lack of characterisation which means you don't really care what happens to any of those involved.

1104,2885582,2015-06-15,guchrisc,Jurassic World (2015),,"A Universal film, the 3D version delights from the first appearance of the studio icon, right through to the end of the film.'Jurassic World' is a film about a dinosaur theme-park set on an island. The 'Jurassic Park' (1993), of two decades earlier, is hinted at in 'Jurassic World'.Film opens with an emotional and harassed mother played by Judy Greer. She is packing her boys off to go on holiday to the dinosaur theme-park. Miss Greer had a small part in the 2013 'Carrie' remake, though my favourite role of hers was in 'The Big Bang Theory' TV series.Nick Robinson (not the BBC Political Editor) plays well the role of the elder brother. He is a surly teenager, uninterested and unreliable. His younger brother is played to perfection by Ty Simpkins. He is in fact a show-business veteran who has been performing since he was a baby, and it shows! He plays a small boy, who like all small boys, has bags of energy, and this is shown well. There are also emotional scenes which are done very well. The two boys feature heavily in the film.The boys arrive at the island as the guests of their aunt (the sister of their mother). However, as she is the chief administrator on the island, and thus very busy, she places them in the care of a surly baby-sitter. Auntie Clare is played by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard. Her character is humourless and work-obsessed. She may not be the best auntie in the world, or the best boss, however her destiny is not that ridiculous dereliction of duty Dwayne Johnson acted out in the recent 'San Andreas'.It is when the boys arrive at the hotel that we see some great scenes. John Ford's 'The Searchers', has that iconic scene of John Wayne inside the door-frame, as the door shuts. Here we have the opposite, as the hotel window opens, and we fly out of the window, to take in the park scenery. What a shot! Jurassic World's Director is Colin Trevorrow. This is only the second film he has directed. The first, which I am very fond of, is a time-travel rom-com called 'Safety Not Guaranteed' (2012). It was written by Derek Connolly. The two also were producers. Here, they have collaborated with the screenplay. Also here from 'Safety,' is Jake Johnson, who is also familiar for his role in the 'New Girl' TV series. Here he plays a cynical and thoughtful technician.The film itself is also cynical. There are a couple of clumsy product-placements. However this is balanced by what can only be described as a not too subtle indictment of capitalism. The best since 'Nightcrawler' (2014). This is seen in many scenes, but 'ride-boy' encapsulates this perfectly.The theme-park wants to make money, thus to keep visitor numbers up, newer dinosaurs need to be introduced. Thus we have DB Wong, from 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' TV series, playing a scientist who is working on that. Earlier this year, Mr Wong played a manic gambler in the con-rom-com 'Focus'. Here he once again plays the role of a serious doctor.Another Law & Order veteran, is also one of my favourite actors, Vincent D'Onofrio. Knowledge of his appearance, was decisive in choosing to see this film. Unlike the small part he played in last year's 'The Judge', here he gets a bigger and more meaty role. His character has a military background. He is cold and ruthless, as well as very persuasive in his forward planning and thinking. Casting must be rated highly. I was particularly happy to see many of my acting favourites in this film.Chris Pratt plays an animal-behaviourist, who understands and empathises with the dinosaurs. This puts him into conflict with the others administering the park. Irrfan Khan, plays a boss, and Lauren Lapkus an underling. Both small parts are played well and believably.The 3D-effects and the special-effects are all done well, and are also enjoyably viewed. The dinosaur scenes are exciting and thrilling. There is a fight sequence reminiscent of 'King Kong'.Much of the film is shot from the POV of the two brothers, who feature heavily in this film, just as much as the adult stars, thus this film will appeal to boys. However UK rating is 12A. Parents should be aware that the eating habits of the dinosaurs may be upsetting for young children. Though boys aged 12+ will lap it up.This film is a concrete lesson on the dangers of putting the pound (£) before principles, or the dollar ($) for that matter too. Scientists play god at their peril, and ours too. As they reverse history and plunge us back into the Jurassic World, we can only once again shout out the old battle-cry of 70 million years ago; ""Death to the dinosaurs!, long live the mammals!"" Film has a much better ending than 'San Andreas'.An enjoyable and exciting film. 10/10.",821,0,,0,No reference

And considering how Moore is documented to distort facts in his other movies (""Bowling for Columbine"" ""Roger and Me"") and books (""Dude, Where's My Country?"", ""Stupid White Men"" ...keeping in mind that was written by a white guy), I could not really watch F9/11 believing everything he said.Yet, I found the way Moore portrayed Bush and his associates rather humorous at many instances and Moore did a good job with how footage was molded, edited and pasted together as a movie (though the pacing of the movie was slow in a couple points). Aside from these, there also is one thing I cannot deny is how the movie will bring out reactions from its viewers. I often heard ""Oh, god..."" being murmured by a man behind me in the crowd and the tougher scenes in the second half of the movie that relate to Iraq got me misty-eyed, as well as sobbing from others in the theater. It also got me to reflect on the times, which I think it might have done for many people who have seen it.While I do not trust Moore's artistic integrity, I do respect his ability as a film maker to draw out emotions and make...well, a pretty darn interesting movie. 7/10",301,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

It doesn't take long 7 minutes for the film to tell us the five go missing and that it becomes a big story around the world. Flashback to one month earlier we follow our heroes as they look to complete their investigation into the Dyatlov Pass incident. We see how strange things start to happen to the group as they get closer to the location of the incident.When I went into this I really didn't know what to expect, I started thinking we would just have the group running around the snow being haunted by something but as it unfolds it turns into accidentally uncovering a conspiracy. Even though it used the idea of found footage the camera work isn't too shaky only have one real scene that is shaky which works for the effect of the story. It really works this because just when we think we understand what is going on that theory gets blown out the water and with a final twist that will shock and leave you asking questions it comes off very enjoyable.

This movie stars/written/directed by Spike Lee and a cast of terrific actors. The movie takes place in Brooklyn on an extremely hot day. Racism is a main theme of the movie between African American, Asian, Italian American and Latino cultures and personalities.

The narrative never gets too preachy, which I applaud Spike Lee for constructing especially since the topic is as heavy as racism, all the characters feel very real and well rounded no one is painted as good or evil, they're all grey characters that are living their life as best as they can.

The editing is extremely well done, It's a very fast-paced without a single boring scene.

After letting a group of goat herders go free, the four men on the mission find themselves between a rock and dozens upon dozens of Taliban. Lone Survivor right off the bat tells you one thing if you are not familiar with the story. Only one of these men survive. I'm putting my money on Marky Mark. Peter Berg, who helmed the disastrous Battleship, somewhat redeems himself here with a realistic take on a poorly planned Navy Seals operation. Berg uses restraint in some much needed areas, which builds tension. Little to know music, dead silence is used to escalate the fear and it works to great effect. Then he goes an kind of ruins it with some melodramatic music cues at other areas, but for the most part, this is an excellently directed film. I point to the sequence in which the characters literally throw themselves off a cliff in order to get away from the gunfire. The stunt coordination for them tumbling down the cliff side is some of the most brutal things put to film. How many times have you seem people jump off a cliff side and tumble down the side in a nice choreographed sequence that has them ""hurting"" a bit once they hit the ground. These guys are thrown around, break bones, cut skin, bleed, cough blood and worse. Watching them being thrown like rag dolls heightens the realism that was needed in Lone Survivor. The film begins and ends with real footage of the men in the Navy Seals. Berg's nod to patriotism for the film. The dramatic parts are too concerned telling the story of these four fellas fight for survival to be bothered with the American flag waving propaganda. The film is small, intimate and personal. All four men give great performances. They all have genuine chemistry with each other, which is what is needed for you to root for their survival. You'd think because they're American and the enemy is the Taliban that it would be automatic, but you'd be surprised. Eric Bana has a small role, anyone could have honestly played that part. The film takes its time to build up to the action sequences, once it hits that note, it never lets up. These men are in the fight for their lives, a fight most of them lose.",404,0,,0,No reference

1121,1254675,2006-07-29,mentalcritic,Batman (1989),10.0,"In 1989, when publicity for the 1989 Batman film was doing the rounds, many a news outlet expressed dismay that Robin was nowhere to be seen, and that no Bam! or Pow! graphics are in sight. Seventeen years later, as a new Batman film has followed similar stylistic conventions and made a decent sum of money, time has vindicated Tim Burton on his stylistic choices. While the film is still campy in various aspects, it has cemented a film rule of the superhero film. Put simply, campy superhero films die. The more seriously one takes the superhero, the better the chance the film has of making back its money. And did this film ever make money. So much of it, in fact, that through a clever percentage deal on the merchandising, Nicholson alone made enough money to almost pay for the cost of 1989's Batman twice over. Although Tim Burton never made such a massive revenue generator again, the fact remains that the profit-to-cost ratio of Batman was such that he could afford to make at least three more write-offs for Warners and still have money left over from Batman to buy credibility with.While Batman is a classic example of choosing the right motif and the right director to execute it, a superhero film is only as good as its actors. Michael Keaton does not get enough credit for his performance as Bruce Wayne here. As one making-of featurette says, he was a less obvious choice for the part. Barely above five and a half feet tall, and with a build to match, Keaton is the last person one would expect to use terror as a weapon against the underworld. Yet he works in the part because he carries himself and enunciates his lines so perfectly. Michael Gough and Tracey Walter provide perfect supports for the hero and villain respectively, proving that no matter how small the part, every casting decision is equally important. I had to look in Walter's biography to confirm that he is the same man who portrayed Miller in Alex Cox's surreal masterpiece Repo Man. In some ways, he steals the show as Bob, the Joker's most trusted lieutenant. But in all superhero films, the titular hero is only as good as his antagonist.And what an antagonist we got in 1989. While I have said that Michael Keaton does not get enough credit for his performance, the critics and media are right in that Jack Nicholson steals the show. There are some scenes in which he overacts, such as his electrifying handshake with Edwin Craig, but his subsequent hit on a mob boss trying to take his position through subterfuge shows a subtlety beyond most actors. In this scene, he is not so much the crazed egomaniac the Joker is generally thought to be, but as a hypertensive, prowling cat. People might think his upfront salary (which has yet to be disclosed) and his merchandising share might be excessive, but he earned it all and then some. His broadcast announcing the presence of his Smilex poison on supermarket shelves is a brilliant exhibition of the warped side of Tim Burton's sense of humour, and it is small wonder that Burton went to Nicholson again to play not one but two parts in his subsequent Mars Attacks! satire.One popular comment about Batman in 1989 was that it was a ""very dark"" film. This is both fair and unfair, as while some would consider this a complaint, the fact of the matter is that it made the film what it is. After directing one sequel, Burton turned over the reigns to Joel Schumacher, and the results were an unmitigated disaster. Whatever else you take away from that story, perhaps the moral of the story is that franchises should not be extended past a certain point. But beyond the ""oooo dark"" monkey-calling of audiences who mistook the 1960s TV series for something worthy of something other than deletion, Batman is also remarkable for making its hero three-dimensional. In one classic sequence, we see Bruce Wayne about to reveal his big secret to his love interest, a less-than-stellar performance by Kim Basinger as a photojournalist. As a rich man called Bruce Wayne, he is unable to do this because he is too fearful of the implications. But when he is sitting in his cave, such fears dissolve. Nobody will ever mistake Batman for a deep psychological study, but this much depth was almost unprecedented in superhero films at that time.Batman was made on a mere thirty-five million dollars, according to estimates. Chump change by today's standards, but at the time it was a big deal. The really amazing part is that seventeen years later, it looks almost comparable to todays hundred-million dollar blockbusters. Clever photography hides the film's age well, as does elaborate costume, makeup, and prop design. The Batmobile and Batwing are true marvels of prop and set design, still impressive in an age where almost anything can be shown on a negative nowadays. Also impressive is the use of a grappling hook to explain how Batman is able to use flight to escape his enemies when needed. Inadequately used in the recent ""reboot"" of the franchise, this device helped to boost the the work already done to make Batman more human. Jerry Seinfeld said it best, the most compelling thing about Batman was that he did not have superpowers. He is just a bored rich guy who suddenly gets the idea into his head to put on an advanced outfit and tear through town, beating seven bells out of major criminals.Fifty years from now, 1989's Batman will still be one of the ten best superhero films. For that reason, I gave it a ten out of ten. See it at least once, it is a true milestone.",969,0,,0,No reference
1122,326464,2001-08-24,SwingBatta,Shrek (2001),6.0,"I've never been a fan of computer-generated films (i.e. the Toy Story series), because, to put it bluntly, it lacks any semblance of soul, as opposed to traditional hand-drawn or stop-motion animation.
Then again, I may be biased; I saw ""Chicken Run,"" one of the best animated films ever made, 31 times in the theater and it was worth every cent.
Still, there's a difference between the painstaking, repetitive process of drawing frames or moving stop-motion puppets in such minute increments and instead just sitting and clicking a mouse, letting the computer do 99% of the work.No matter how you look at it, though, what really matters in the end is the color green. Both movies turned huge profits for DreamWorks, grossing over $350 million combined in the U.S. and making Jeff Katzenberg look pretty darned smart for bidding adieu to Disney years ago.But, in this reviewer's opinion, ""Shrek"" doesn't hold a candle to CR in terms of story and characterization. No doubt the graphics are terrific, but it doesn't make up for the surprisingly weak plot.Visually, it's very stimulating, with an abundance of brilliant colors in every frame; nothing ever looks pasty or parched. The impromptu romance between a huge, lovesick dragon and the wiseacre Donkey, who is easily the film's greatest asset despite his lack of laughs (""Shrek! I'm lookin' down!"" and ""I'm makin' waffles!"" are some of his best lines), makes for a humorous subplot.However, the story of our heroes, Shrek and his sidekick donkey  simply known as, well, Donkey  attempting to rescue Princess Fiona from the dastardly Lord Farquaad in an attempt to rid Shrek's homeland of exiled fairytale characters, quickly becomes an afterthought in favor of potshots, self-indulgence and, at times, just plain mean-spiritedness.""Shrek"" rips off so many sources of modern pop culture that it would make Puff Daddy proud. For a film that is supposedly set in a Dark Ages-like era, it's an anachronistic paradise.It's not so much the ripping off that is bad, though; it just seemed that no attempts were exerted in making any of it look somewhat original.
Mike Myers brings his Scottish accent out of mothballs (temporarily retired following the terrible ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"") for the portly, self-centered, Lou Grant-like reclusive ogre, who is now the most famous green creature to hit the big screen since Kermit the Frog and who has a weird penchant for eyeball dinners and outhouses.
That's right, the latter opens up the door for the usual bodily function jokes. And apparently the filmmakers couldn't wait to get at it; the first comes during the opening credits. (Side note: It's not smart to include the voice cast in the opening credits either  this goes for any animated picture.) Things certainly do not get off to a good start when we are also subjected to Smash Mouth's ""All Star"" for the zillionth time, but I digress.John Lithgow gives a lively, spirited, and sometimes demonic performance as theer, short-tempered, tyrannical Farquaad, a creep I wouldn't want as my next-door neighbor anytime soon. You listen to that moniker enough times and it begins to sound like a certain four-letter word, considering that this movie is pretty much aimed at the kiddies. Just don't ask the young uns to try and pronounce it afterwards. His character is peppered with familiar yet effective ""short"" gags.Eddie Murphy runs roughshod as the wisecracking Donkey, and perhaps like Robin Williams, you get the feeling that, sometime during production, Murphy was allowed to insert some of his own frenetic, unrestrained material into the script. Sometimes it works, particularly when he's sweet-talking the fearsome dragon, but most of the time it doesn't. (It also permitted a few inevitable ""ass"" jokes to worm their way into the dialogue as well.) You may be tempted to call me a sourpuss, but he scarcely got a laugh out of me during the course of the picture.Little needs to be said about Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), whose only purpose was seemingly just to engage in a forced romance and a ""Three's Company""-type misunderstanding with our hero, and for the film to include yet another damned spoof of ""The Matrix,"" a gag that is now as old as used toilet paper. This all leads up to a predictable ending that could be seen from a country mile away.By the way, from here on out, anyone who spoofs ""The Matrix"" in any way, shape or form for the sake of a cheap laugh should have their eyebrows removed with Krazy Glue.We also must endure five minutes of tiresome WWF-style antics as Shrek takes out an army of knights in a wrestling ring, which he caps off with a Hulk Hogan-style posedown.But that is all small potatoes compared to what is perhaps the true motive behind this film. It's a shame that Katzenberg chose to turn it into one big piece of anti-Disney propaganda, clearly visible in such scenes as Farquaad's spacious theme park, complete with singing merchandise stands and big-headed mascots, among other things. On the side, it beats the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" moral over our heads with the subtlety of a lead pipe. ""Beauty and the Beast,"" anyone?Much to no one's surprise, ""Shrek"" easily made a killing at the box office. Despite its success, however, this film could easily have been a whole lot more, but it's sacrificed in favor of its misguided holier-than-thou opinion of itself. If you want a genuinely enjoyable animated picture with a superior plot, I highly suggest ""Chicken Run"" instead.But if Katzenberg's ludicrous goal was simply to stick it to the House of Mouse, it comes off as hypocritical, since ""Shrek"" goes through all the arduous trouble of borrowing extensively from the competition's product in the first place in a flimsy attempt at sculpting its own commodity. 7/10",974,0,,0,No reference

On the whole the game and graphics engines work well the graphics are good and have a nice character to them which is lacking in so many games now. The character design is good and the bosses are unique and imaginative. The game flows thru the story well and leads the player thru enjoyable chapters with a good sense of level design. The gameplay takes a little getting used to especially seeing how the Dreamcast joypad isn't the best of designs. Gameplay wise it's only failings could be blamed on the limits of the pad, which could've been corrected on a different system... altho from what I've heard they haven't. Like for example having a freelook on another analogue stick or a crosshair for manual aim, but oh well. However like all games there are some failings that are present and unfortuently offputing, these being the motorbike sections. These should've been a real joy to play but they just turned out terrible. This is mainly due to dire controls of the bike and as such makes proceeding thru the game feel more of a chore, however once you've done that nasty bit of driving you get a nice on foot level. ^_^; To be blunt the bike feels more like you're controlling a jet propelled shopping trolly.

You might throw some transitions shots now and then or get crafty with the editing but not much more. The acting, though, is crucial as the number of characters is limited, but no actor could lift a poor script in these conditions. This kind of films are all about screen writing. Limiting the characters freedom of movement to the extreme while keeping the action thrilling, the tension growing and the characters engaging is definitely a risky experiment, but for that same reason, appealing, tempting and worth giving it a shot.Steven Knight has succeed at writing one, and then was lucky enough to have Tom Hardy rising up to the occasion and making the whole thing shine.The drive to London is thrilling and as I watched I found myself more than once ¨in distress¨, as you hear the main character Ivan Locke say more than often. There's enough going on to keep the audience engaged, in fact, there is so much going on that Locke's charisma comes precisely from his ability to handle it the way he does. Familiar and work issues arise at once from one single decision that pushes him to drive through the night while managing it all with only the help of a phone and colossal patience and composure. Ivan Locke stays solid, but perfectly human. His motivations, his strength, his reasoning are all well explained, both efficiently and beautifully, and the phone calls follow without losing the rhythm at any point. The film manages to get your mind in and out of the car at will, while keeping events flowing and characters growing, and all is backed up by a very interesting dilemma.The plot is solid.

But my interest in those films started after I read a news on the internet about an incident that happened in the United Kingdom. There, a cinema was jam-packed by mainly children who came in to watch Madagascar 3. However, a mistake occurred. Instead of putting Madagascar 3, the projectionist put in Paranormal Activity 4. This triggered a large scream coming from the cinema, causing some shocked kids to go home immediately, although some remained to finally watched the film they came for. Some time later, a woman, who was watching with her kids, describes the films in the Paranormal Activity series as the scariest of horror films. Because of that, it made me wonder just how scary those films are.Days after that, I purchase a VCD of the first Paranormal Activity film and watched it. Although it is a homemade film, what perhaps made it score well in the box office is that it has original themes. In the film, each night is counted and monitored.

1139,2462475,2013-05-19,kols,Warehouse 13 (2009–2014),7.0,"Especially the character of Claudia. While most of the other recurring characters are fine, well acted and occasionally engaging, Allison Scagliotti's Claudia is the only one with fire and passion. H. G. Wells shares some of Claudia's intensity but pales just a little in comparison.And I have to give the concept of the Warehouse applause for it's originality and potential as an endless source of interesting episodes, which, unfortunately, it has failed to mine.A really sore point with me is 'Getting Soap Opera-y' which means stretching a story line through multiple episodes in high melodrama using cliff-hanger plots that change the rules with each new resolution while driving towards an Apocalypse. I like my shows better when episodes are episodic, a new story each week. Past few seasons, WH 13 has emphasized the former. Even then, I still find the scenes with Claudia worth watching and, with a little less melodrama and cliff-hanging, I could have enjoyed the serials, especially the one centered on Wells. Except for an even bigger flaw: Pete.The insecure, self-absorbed Egotist has been a staple of western drama since the Renaissance, usually played for comic relief (Falstaff). But there is one hard and fast rule in writing the character - you never let them refer to themselves in the first person. It grates. I I Me Me Mine Mine will, eventually, have you throwing tomatoes at the actor and your shoe at the TV set. That's how I feel about Pete; every time I hear him say I, Me or Mine I cringe and change channels. His character is annoying enough without rubbing it in.There is a technical reason for this prohibition: narcissists use first person pronouns to draw attention to themselves which brings the plot-line to a screeching halt and you feel like you just hit a wall. Anyone else, those pronouns just fly by; the Petes screaming 'LOOK AT ME!' drive you off the screen. For all of that, if WH 13 ever returns to its roots and becomes, once again, episodic I'll be a fan. Toning down Pete would be a grand bonus.And WH 13 is far from being the only offender - Joe and Brian in Wings and Frasier in Frasier (not so much Cheers) are every bit as irritating when using the Toxic I.Back to Claudia - she is a delight, simply watching her on the screen.Finally, my criticisms are purely personal - if you can stomach Pete or if you liked WH 13's Soap-Opera-y-ness serial-ness, more power.",417,0,,0,No reference
1140,2705259,2014-08-05,justin-ward79,Vertigo (1958),8.0,"Upon browsing through critic and user reviews containing varying degrees of appreciation for this film I have decided to share my own thoughts on the so called masterpiece. The two things I have concluded about it are that: (1) No, I believe it is not a flawless piece of cinematic intrigue, but that (2) the movie, regardless of some negative reviews, does have some great characters that work serve the material very well. Now, I say that the film is no masterpiece because of the way the story unfolds. Like many other people who responded negatively to watching this film, I found the it lacking in any suspense and/or tension whatsoever in some parts (and all parts after the letter writing scene) and that seriously dulls down the movie to some extent. Where some may go on to deride the characters and acting, however, my problems cease with the previously stated story issues and a few illogical hiccups (Ferguson's silence and the perfect doppelgänger to name a couple). I believe that the characters are very well done and the fact that you get to view both leads and see their sides as the mystery unfolds really does balance well against the lack of suspense. It was actually quite entertaining with this mystery that continued to keep me guessing for the first half of the story. I especially enjoyed James Stewart performance as Ferguson and how we start off being thrown in right as his life begins to go downhill and how we continue to watch that turmoil develop. I think it is a very interesting direction to send the character that works even if it probably shouldn't considering it doesn't start with him at a better point in his life first in order to show how far he's fallen. Honestly if the scene where Novak's character was writing that damn letter had appeared later in the film I may have even agreed with calling it a masterpiece.Note: This is just my view of some of what I believe are the more important aspects of this film. I have not seen very many Hitchcock films and as such do not have much insight into how this stacks up with his other films and could easily be missing something in that regard (if that makes any sense). I have also only seen the film once and the film could very well become more enjoyable with future viewings. Oh and sorry for going between I and we so liberally at that one moment. Also for any other butchering of the English language that may it may not be visible throughout.",437,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

The fast-paced camerawork and editing matches the chaotic scenes in the strategy rooms of all 3 nominees (well, just Russell and Santos really, as Hoynes has no chance).Josh, of course, is in his element with his quick-fire thinking, as he sees the votes for each state roll in, and he has to beg delegates to stick with Santos into the 2nd or 3rd ballots.There is similar chaos in the Russell camp, with Will Bailey & Donna constantly on the phones pleading with swinging state delegates to go with Russell.But this becomes even more tactical when Senator Baker decides not to accept the VP offer from either Russell or Santos, but decides to got it alone from the convention floor, and because of his popularity he is sweeping up states from Russell, Hoynes and Santos, thus causing more panic in both camps.Its so fast and chaotic it will leave you breathless and probably confused, but it makes for brilliant TV drama, especially when the convention goes into a rare second day, and Leo is leaning ever more hard on Josh/Santos to back down or at least take the VP spot under Russell.Ultimately the final result was probably never in doubt, although the choice of VP did take me aback.

1145,1678310,2008-08-02,Bunuel1976,The Terror of the Tongs (1961),6.0,"Surprisingly, I quite liked this atypical Hammer offering, which is basically a companion piece to THE STRANGLERS OF BOMBAY (1960) – with the setting changed to 1910s China, and the vicious “thuggees” replaced with the equally murderous Red Dragon Tongs. As a matter of fact, one might say that the script for STRANGLERS served as a virtual template for this one – to which Hammer then assigned Jimmy Sangster, their in-house scribe, in order to apply the necessary alterations (though, in the long run, the former still emerges as the better picture of the two)! With this in mind, THE TERROR OF THE TONGS likewise thrives on violent acts (with the exploitation factor increased a notch in this case thanks to the compulsively sleazy atmosphere of taverns and opium dens) – and the hero, too, is eventually subdued to excruciating torture but saved at the last minute.Interestingly, Christopher Lee’s role as the Tong leader anticipates his later Fu Manchu characterization – which he played in five low-budget outings (of gradually decreasing merits) throughout the second half of the decade. While the gaunt actor is always worth watching, here he seems to be acting through his voice alone – as his character is usually depicted sitting down and ordering his underlings about (even when finally cornered, he keeps a thoroughly calm demeanor)! Geoffrey Toone is an agreeable hero, being unusually brawny: he goes after the Tongs after they callously murder his teenage daughter; later, he saves slave girl Yvonne Monlaur from their clutches – the French actress (who was also in THE BRIDES OF Dracula and CIRCUS OF HORRORS {both 1960}) is a delightful presence in the film, even if her role seldom rises above that of the ‘servile Oriental’ stereotype! Supporting characters include a crippled beggar (played by Marne Maitland, who was also in STRANGLERS) who’s secretly organizing opposition to the Tongs – and has no qualms about exploiting Toone’s personal tragedy to this end!; returning from the earlier film, too, is Roger Delgado – who virtually replicates his part of the chief villain’s closest henchman! Ultimately, THE TERROR OF THE TONGS looks very good in color and is generally pacy at just 76 minutes; by the way, director Bushell had himself been an actor – numbering genre roles such as the bland hero of THE GHOUL (1933) and the ill-fated snobbish Colonel in the QUATERMASS AND THE PIT (1958) TV serial among his resume'.",405,0,,0,No reference

Naturally it is highly derivative and sometimes it is very difficult to ignore the sudden thought popping into your head of where you have seen this scene before but at least the disparate scenes were put together with reasonable cohesion.On the plus side the whole film does not seem to take itself too seriously, it rocks along at a reasonable pace and it does not overstay its welcome at all. On the negative side some of the jokes are a little forced, some of the acting is a little annoying, inevitably the item songs took you completely out of the film, some of the ADR was poor, some of the actors cannot lip sync to save their lives and there is not enough of Ileana especially in the last quarter of the film.The direction was solid, the cinematography was good and overall a not exactly taxing way of spending a few hours. However, it does illustrate how bereft of ideas modern Indian cinema seems to be as far as making films is concerned - it really is far too derivative to be anything but a pleasant interlude on an otherwise boring day.

Stavisky, whose shenanigans involving phony bank bonds nearly crippled the French economy, is a man of no scruples and Belmondo excels --- he's likable and detestable at the same time. Resnais bends time and space & transports what could have been a run- of-the-mill gangster yarn into much more. It's a character study of a man without any character. Shot in the south of France and featuring a supporting cast that includes Michel Lonsdale and Claude Rich (as a very dogged inspector), this film is a classic.

Ending leaves it open for a possible second series and I hope they make one as I will certainly watch it.",120,1,,1,Reference to other reviews
1149,2703733,2014-08-03,kevinxirau,Guardians of the Galaxy (2014),8.0,"Frankly, I'm still a little surprised they made a movie out of this team since the Guardians are not as big as Spider-Man or the Avengers and are only just starting to gain some popularity. But, for a film that has a talking raccoon and a tree man that only says three words, this movie managed to be a great new installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a set-up to what appears to be the famous Infinity Gauntlet story arc for what may be Avengers 3. Anyway, the is Guardians of the Galaxy.Plot: Peter Jason Quill a.k.a. Star Lord is an intergalactic outlaw who finds himself in a heap of trouble when he steals an unknown object of unimaginable power from an old temple with the Kree radical Ronin the Accuser having his eyes on it. Wanted by this villain and the law (the Nova Corps) alike, this unlikely hero gains some unlikely allies to combat this threat, which consists of a skilled assassin named Gamora, a berserker out for revenge called Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the ill-tempered genetically-altered raccoon and his tree-like companion Groot. With the odds and checkered pasts stacked against them, can the Guardians of the Galaxy conquer a madman out for unlimited power?With such a bizarre concept and team, I initially wondered if people would even gravitate towards this movie, especially since the Guardians aren't as iconic as Hulk or Iron Man, but, to my surprise, it was well-received and I can see why. The story is actually pretty interesting and takes advantage of exploring this vast universe full of interesting creatures, technology, and even worlds. The action scenes are pretty awesome, well-choreographed with each character showing off his/her skills and abilities and beating the living crap out of each other. It especially gets intense during the big climax of the film with so much being at stake, on par with the final battle of ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". The special effects are also good, with an amazing mix of both CGI and practical effects. There's also a surprising amount of comedy, which for the most part is bound to make you laugh throughout the whole film, especially the post-credit scene which only comic book fans will get. I also gotta give creds to the music, a mix of classic 80s songs with some pretty epic original music.Now for the characters, who, by the way, are casted quite nicely. Star Lord is the kind of guy who has lost his way and needed some kind of crisis and a bunch of new friends to get him of the right path. Knowing that he has no powers, his greatest asset is arguably his wit as he can come up with the craziest idea and make it seem like he could really pull it off, that and his awesome gadgets. Gamora is sexy but also has an interesting depth to her, especially when you learn about her nice back story. Drax is fun, a guy of simple taste, a thrill for action, and a humorous lack of understanding of metaphors. Rocket Raccoon, a fan favorite, may seem like the dumbest idea for a Marvel character but his rough personality combined with his skill with guns and ships make him a delight to watch. Seriously, this little guy can threaten you and you would believe him. By far the best character, in my opinion, is Groot. He has an impressive set of powers that can give almost anyone a run for their money, but he also has a big heart (and puppy dog eyes), which leads to some of the most heart-warming moments you'll find in this film. An excellent performance from Vin Diesel.As for the villain, Ronin is the typical fanatic, but he at least has some sense of menace to him and he is a formidable enemy to the Guardians, plus his fanaticism is thankfully downplayed to an extent so he becomes more tolerable. A decent villain, though he's no Loki.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is a refreshing entry to the superhero genre with its action, story, characters, effects, and comedy. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're into superheroes or a good old-fashioned space adventures, so check it out.",706,0,,0,No reference

Lisa takes a fair amount of abuse in this episode and that's okay by me.7. I liked Lisa's joke about how nobody watches documentaries unless they are about rich men who may have committed murders. I know they are referring to a different documentary but to me it served as a funny reference to the Oscar-Winning ""OJ Made In America""8. It's for the best that Krusty deleted the Dan Quayle jokes.

Delicatessen is set in a run-down, quirky apartment building where the landlord (who is also the butcher in his downstairs deli) kills visitors to feed his tenants.  This doesn't seem to bother the residents, who belly up to the deli counter on mornings after a murder to get their share of meat.  Some of them even help the landlord when it comes time to kill.

But there's a new visitor in the building, a circus performer who signs-on as a handyman.  He hits it off with the landlord's daughter.  They become attached.  But the residents get hungry for meat, and chaos ensues. The movie is in French with English subtitles.  The acting is sufficiently odd and hilarious.  The sets, lighting and overall feel of the movie make it dark and surreal--fitting for its cannibalistic theme.  I found it thoroughly enjoyable, nicely paced, and entertaining.

But it's an exquisitely photographed piece of pretentious nonsense. Writer/Director Greenaway seems to equate the cruelty of the working-class thief with his lack of appreciation for fine art. I'm particularly amused by how many people want to see this as a metaphor for Margaret Thatcher's oppression of the working class -- the politics of the film are the exact reverse of that metaphor. In Greenaway's vision, the educated are helpless victims of the ignorant working class. (Does Greenaway forget that his beloved Shakespeare had no formal education?) He seems to have made the movie as a poison pen letter to the ignorant masses who showed no interest in his previous pretentious movies. The truth is that Greenaway makes boring art films. (And I love a good art film, but it better deserve that label.) It's still a very well acted film, with superb cinematography. The sets and costumes are so color coordinated that, when Helen Mirren moves from the red room to the white room, her dress changes from red to white. And most moviegoers don't seem to notice. But it's set in a very artificial world. (It's a pretty small world, too. It only consists of four rooms and a parking lot.) We get no sense that there might be some authorities investigating the crimes committed in the film, or that our heroes might just move away to avoid the cruel thief. Greenaway's universe is as small as his vision. Many moviegoers are mesmerized by the stunning visual design, but it wasn't enough to hold me in. The thief's graphic brutality is downright repugnant.

The fact of the matter is that this film actually did have a lot going for it, especially considering that they changed so much about the story, but at the end of the day, it's just another soulless cashgrab of a remake. Character development was quite shallow, a lot of the editing in the action sequences was really bad, the pacing of the story was uneven, and overall it's such a letdown.

Deep down, I knew this movie was going to be mediocre.Disney is successfully conning people who worship the Mouse out of $30 for a single mediocre film.

The lead characters are played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini. Strong performances by supporting characters all around make this film feel like an ensemble cast, not just the story of two people. Louis-Dreyfus plays Eva, a divorced masseuse who schleps her massage table around town, rubbing her clients' sore muscles and half-listening to their monologues. She is the invisible servant. She meets Albert (Gandolfini) at a party a moment after she tells her friends that there are no attractive people at the party. They have things in common. They both have daughters who are heading to college. They are both divorced. They fall into a comfortable pace with each other. Life has bruised them but they are comfortable with themselves. The script has many great lines and brings us some unexpected delights in the conversations we overhear. Louis-Dreyfus plays a character which is not unlike her character in the television series ""The New Adventures of Old Christine."" She is always torn. She is co-dependent and has difficulty drawing boundaries in her life, but she is very likable. Louis-Dreyfus is extremely charming in this role. She could be nominated for this performance at awards season.This is Gandolfini's last performance. He died after the film was completed. As TV's Tony Soprano, we have seen him play the thug with a lot of problems. Here, as Albert, he is a sweet slob licking his wounds from the divorce. He is comfortable with himself. Gandolfini will surely win an acting award for this performance. His Albert is a complete character, and we believe him. Gandolfini makes him real.Both characters convey the sense that they are attracted to each other because they can truly be themselves together, Pretense is not necessary. The story puts Ava in a most difficult position when she meets Albert's ex-wife. Romance in middle age is sometimes very uncomfortable because of the onset of physical decline.

While a lot of the early reviews have panned the love story and the performances of Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, I would tend  to disgree,, yea they arent as good as some of the elders, but they are ok and the romance (while perhaps taking up a bit oo much screen time) is properly handled as a kindof corny flirtation between two teenagers who are both somewhat full of themselves.

His father's company manufactured farm machinery and supported Hitler because Hitler promised to improve the farmer's lot. Josef Mengele, an introverted child, had no interest in farming or in politics and wanted to be a doctor. He received his degree from Munich University.He studied anthropology too, but a curious kind of anthropology that wasn't so unusual in the 20s and 30s. Charles Darwin's ideas of natural selection had been extended to ""races"" and to cultures. The fittest survived. And in Nazi Germany, Hitler had decreed that the Aryan race was superior to all others, and that Slavs and Jews were genetically inferior. Similar, less extreme movements could be found elsewhere. Herbert Spencer in England was a social Darwinist. But in Nazi Germany, genetics (""race"") and learned behavior (""culture"") became all mixed up. Jews, of course, were Jews by virtue of their religion, which is learned, not through inheritance.Mengele was ambitious and the easiest path to the top lay in joining the SS, which he did. The practice of medicine was swept up in racist ideology. The oath to Hippocrates was superseded by the oath to the Führer. It began with minor procedures like abortion and sterilization, then quickly slid down the slippery slope. Propaganda films were shown, portraying the mentally disabled as ""poor wretches"" who are hopeless and should be relieved of their misery. I've seen one of these films, from 1939, and it's effective. At the time, Hitler had never heard of Mengele.With the coming of war, the program was expanded. How long could people live in ice water? How long could they survive an extremely low air pressure? Human guinea pigs were chosen from among the Untermenschen. But he also collected hundreds of sets of twins and kept them separate for more detailed studies. Presumably the Soviet Union got the data, which was too bad because twin studies today are a flourishing business in the attempt to separate genetics from learning.Mengele took care of ""his twins,"" as he called them, when he wasn't killing them, but of his 3,000, only two hundred or so survived. As the end of the war approached he had them herded into the extermination rooms. They survived because Aschwitz had run out of Zyklon B.At the end of the war, Mengele escaped punishment by disguising himself as an ordinary soldier in the Wehrmacht. After several years serving as a farmhand he made his way across the border into Italy, where he was given a new identity as a refugee, thence to Argentina. After twelve years working at a pharmaceutical firm he grew tired of the masquerade and assumed his real name, applying for a German passport, which was granted.The hunt for Mengele, ""The Doctor of Death"", was unrelenting. He moved from country to country, acquire a twenty-five year old lover, suffered a stroke while swimming at the beach and died.

1177,2656337,2014-05-04,braddugg,Psycho (1960),10.0,"Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.

To pigeonhole this as a thriller would be wrong as per me. It has a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, a huge amount of drama, and even a family backdrop. With all such elements, it would be wrong if I were to categorize this as merely a thriller. Yes, it is filled with thrills and for the 110 minutes of running time, there is hardly any dull moment.

I have seen this movie, a number of times before and each time it had a terrific impact. Also, I have always found something new, maybe a new frame, new shot or a new background sound. The discovery does not seem to stop. This I attribute to the many elements that are involved in this film.

From placing the camera, composing the shot, revealing the right emotion and making the audiences wait till the shocking aspect is revealed, Hitchcock is at his best in this film. This is indeed one of the more simpler stories he dealt. Yet, he made it so impact full that it continues to surprise audiences even today. Thanks to the music by Bernard Hermann, whose contribution to the film is very important. I cannot imagine this film without the music and I believe that it's because of the music, that the resonance was acquired.

If it's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impact full. Now, I do not want to reveal those and give away some details. I can simply say, I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else.

The cast is perfect equally, Anthony Perkins does a wonderful job as Norman Bates. He is cold blooded and yet looks so deceptively humane as an extremely caring human. This film and ""The Trial"" are perhaps the most important films in his career.

It is the first psychological thriller of it's kind as I read in various other sites and perhaps it is also the most violent films made. Though the violence comes for less than 10 minutes, it haunts so brutally, as if it was there all through the film.

It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest films of all time by one of the greatest directors.

1178,3139673,2016-09-02,dementedoracle,Dark Matter (2015–2017),8.0,"If you read nothing else:

This series has a rough start, so don't go in unless you're prepared to commit to watching through the first season. The accusations of weak special effects and uninspired sets are completely true. The performance value at times perfectly reflects the remarkably low expectations we've come to set for every SyFy original production sans The Expanse. But woah, does it get hella better.

The Writing:

The writing here is strong. Really strong, and not just ""for SyFy"". In the early episodes the characters are presented as stiff archetypes you would expect from a run-of-the-mill science fiction show. That's not in itself such a bad thing because it's part of what we love about the genre, but it can easily give the early impression the show is canned. Stick with it. The first season does a wonderful job giving lingering attention to each character's backstory, fleshing them out and making each one dynamic. By the end of the series, the writing makes a bold, decisive shakeup to the entire show that solved virtually all the issues I felt with it up to that point, and gave it strong legs going forward. I now anticipate every Friday night, waiting to watch the next episode.

The Characters:

This is where most of the comparisons to Firefly will land. You could easily line the characters up against the crew of Serenity and play a game matching them to their Dark Matter counterparts. To me this wasn't a bad thing. If there's any show I want to see shamelessly copied, is that space pirate masterpiece. At first the show-runners handle the characters and their banter clumsily in comparison to Whedon's veteran guidance, but over time the crew members shed their imitation qualities and develop their own endearing identities. My one complaint is that I would love to see that same attention given to the shows many villains.

With a couple exceptions, the seven-member ensemble cast does a fine job in their roles, with Zoie Palmer (holy crap, she's good), Melissa O'Neil, and Anthony Lemke on the high end. Jodelle Ferland and Roger Cross come in middle of the run. Alex Mallari Jr. and Marc Bendavid's characters made me grind my teeth a lot, but looking back I think their problems are more to do with poor direction and inflexible characterization on the writers' part. They still serve their purpose on the show, and over time the good far makes up for the bad.

The Special Effects and Sets:

Ugh. Avoid this show if this is all you care about. And SyFy as a whole, actually.",435,0,,0,No reference
1179,2813965,2015-02-11,billygoat1071,Paddington (2014),8.0,"Paddington is the kind of family movie that used to be more popular few decades ago. I mean there are more movies like this today, but they often get even lazier by relying too much on the cuteness of the talking animals and having uninspired humor and forced pop culture references (e.g. Alvin and the Chipmunks movies.) Paddington is refreshing for just being loyal to its own magic. It fully embraces its weird but quirky personality, and yet provides the right amount of heart in the end. It's nothing transcendent to the genre, but this is a better example of a movie that is best treated for the whole family.The film aims to relive the classic appeal of this type of movies. It does hold the same formula, like how the family slowly earns their love to the friendly creature they discovered, and the plot involves a lot of crazy antics, plus the villain is terribly campy who apparently belongs in a cartoon. But the movie never underestimates itself into a mediocre fare and instead finds creative ways to move through its story. It takes place in a delightful world that perfectly fits in their constant absurdity. It shows a lot of imaginative visuals and comically thrilling set pieces. But this frantic lightheartedness doesn't betray its center. Paddington doesn't get the warm welcome he expected in his first visit in London, until the people around him learn what kind of a bear he truly is. It gets a little predictable, but that clear message of acceptance is delivered with sincerity, even from the very start, which makes it quite nice anyway.The local Philippine version has Xian Lim voicing Paddington Bear instead of Ben Whishaw. The vocal performance is okay, though it sometimes feels a little less heartfelt in his line deliveries. It's much more intriguing to know what kind of warmth Whishaw provided in the original version. The actors on screen brought plenty of charm in its playfulness: even with the earnestness that defines the strict father, Hugh Bonneville is committed to be silly in some of the character's comedic scenes. And Nicole Kidman is appropriately over-the-top as the main villain.People might think that Paddington is kind of dated, at glance, but the filmmakers have real love to the material and this genre, thus make it work in this context. Even with its childish cartoon-like madness, it never tones itself down, and instead makes something truly fun out of those silliness. Again, it never really break any grounds, but it's such a heartwarming little film, giving you a real reason why you should love this character, other than just being another cute talking animal.",444,0,,0,No reference

While it has a wonderful twist, it also presents a very strange and confusing message about drunk driving. The show begins with a guy in a Rolls Royce driving about town erratically. He then plows into a man on the sidewalk--killing him. Here is where it's odd--AFTER he runs over the man, instead of hiding the booze, he begins drinking more! Then, he freely admits he was drinking but fights hard against receiving any sort of substantial penalty for the crime.Soon the story becomes a preachy social commentary show about the evils of drunk driving and the weakness of the laws punishing these folks. While all this was very true back in 1981 and it makes a great case for strengthening the laws, SUDDENLY midway through the show Quincy realizes that this is NOT a case of vehicular manslaughter as a result of drunk driving but premeditated murder. As a result, all the grandstanding and preaching about the ills of drinking and driving are forgotten. And, in an uncomfortable ending at Danny's, Quincy and his friends (including the anti-drunk driving advocate in her wheelchair) are all toasting their victory. What victory? The drunk driving laws and precedent were unchanged. Odd.It's all a shame, as without the preachy bits, the idea of a man pretending to be drunk to hide a murder is great. But, instead it's like two episodes--and the one where Quincy was on a crusade to increase penalties for drunk drivers ended up instantly vanishing late in the episode! Weird but still watchable.By the way, the advocate in the wheelchair was using a desk which did NOT fit her chair and some of her file cabinets were inaccessible to her in her own office!

And I really liked a lot of them from both styles. But it was a special occasion when ""Gulliver's Travels"" was shown. I even preferred it to Disney's animated movies. Watching it again as an adult I can now see it's many weakness including it's primary flaw: that Fleischer Studios tried to make a Walt Disney movie instead of a Fleischer brothers movie. It is too clearly a reaction to ""Snow White"". And that's a pity. Both as a child and even now, my favorite cartoons of all are the Fleischer productions of the thirties... Betty Boop and especially Popeye. Disney's short cartoons generally just don't compare; too shallow, too insipid. I didn't use those words 40 years ago, but I felt the same then. And although Gulliver reproduced these Disney deficiencies, enough of the Fleischer style was present for me to really like it.

1185,3349146,2017-07-24,Reno-Rangan,Tschick (2016),8.0,"The coming-of-age road adventure based on the book of the same name. From the director of 'Soul Kitchen'. It was like any other similar themed teen flick, has all the same formulas, but what makes it special is it is being a German film. I'm not saying it is new for German film, but definitely not every year flooded with such plenty of flicks like in the Hollywood. Besides, there are other major differences, as it is culture, mindset of the kids and the type of adventure.The original title name is the name of one of the main film characters. But the story was observed from another character who has been with him all along. Opened with some road accident and soon the flashback follows to reveal what happened till that point of the film. For me the story did not impress, it was how everything was presented on the screen. It was a 90 minute film, and straight to the point kind of narration. Which means the pace was never compromised.It tells the story of two teenage boys how they have spent their summer. After not invited to the birthday party to whom he has a crush on, Maik decides to go an unexpected road trip with his new, weird friend. A lifetime journey. Being a teenager and taking a such ride unwraps his mind as he was only living in the small world so far. Which particularly points out his one sided romance. At the end of his adventure where stands and the aftermath of everything was briefly disclosed.❝Someone just needs to scratch in some letters, then it will be 'Atomic Crisis of 2016'.❞The 'road movie' has been just a concept, but the stories created around it was very nice. Like many mini episodes, whenever they encounter the new people, the new places. At its halfway through, the third character was introduced. It was one of the best improvement. At first it was not intentional, but going further it becomes. Might not close to the real life, but makes such impression that's not too far from the reality. On how some people slipped away from the actual world and the contact with its people. Obviously with the reason, that does not reveal to us because of not to make any further complication in the storytelling.The overall best thing about the film was not digging anything so in detail. Everything about the film was a rough cut. Except the opening parts in the school where the plot was initiated. It was more of an introduction than the initiation. And the remaining film was a transformation from something what we knew its state of condition (of the main character) to the ultimate goal (which was not expected).It drags the gay topic, but throw away immediately. Similarly a few other topics as well. Yeah, the film was fun, as it told from the teenager's perspective, not the entire film to be considered very seriously. Though there some parts make sense and inspires, despite done/committed on the contrary. When it comes to the cast, it was flawless performances. Both the lead boys were awesome. The odd combination worked out well. But it was not that odd, while narrating the story.The Maik reminded me the Wiley Wiggins from 'Dazed and Confused'. The film was not predictable, but the path it has taken was. If I say the film was excellent, that does not mean all of you would enjoy it. Surely teenagers, and children film fans would, but those who are familiar with this kind might find nothing new in it. For them it does not matter, it is an American or a German film. That does not mean it's not worth a watch. So try it, despite you are going to like it or not in the later.7.5/10",636,0,,0,No reference

1189,1266440,2006-08-13,cariart,On Dangerous Ground (1951),10.0,"""On Dangerous Ground"", Nicholas Ray's short, yet powerful drama of one cop's journey from destruction to redemption, took nearly two years to reach the screen upon completion, was panned by critics and ignored by audiences when released, and still generates discussion to this day (How much is actually Ray's vision, and how much did Howard Hughes change it, prior to release?) Fortunately, time has given perspective to the film, and it is recognized, today, as one of the greater film noir classics of the era, and a showcase of it's star, the unfairly underrated Robert Ryan.The film, based on Gerald Butler's ""Mad with Much Heart"", of a British policeman finding renewal during a manhunt in the English countryside, was rewritten, by director Ray and screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides, into a three-movement 'symphonic' piece: big city cop (Ryan), sliding toward self-destruction as the corruption and filth he deals with, daily, destroys his soul (1st movement); exiled into the mountains to observe and aid in a manhunt, he meets a blind girl (Ida Lupino) with the purity and innocence he once had, and a local (Ward Bond), whose brutal single-mindedness mirrored the man he had become (2nd movement); and his metamorphosis, falling in love, attempting to save the girl's brother instead of simply crushing him, and rediscovering in himself the 'good' man he had been, and could be, again (3rd movement). Contemporary audiences, expecting a straight-forward action tale, couldn't understand this subtle character study (even co-star Ida Lupino called the script 'weak'), but Ray, who loved stories of alienation and spiritual rebirth, particularly in an era when many of his peers were being 'blacklisted' in the Communist 'witch-hunts', refused to sacrifice the richness of characterization and structure, simply to make the tale more 'commercial'. While Howard Hughes' tinkering diluted the symphonic format, somewhat (adding a romantic climax, as Ryan and Lupino end the film in each other's arms), he actually improved the film, clarifying the action, and 'cleaning up' a few ambiguous elements. This is one film where 'too many cooks' didn't ruin the 'recipe'! Of particular importance is the remarkable music score, by Bernard Herrmann. The brilliant composer was returning to Hollywood after conducting the CBS Symphony Orchestra for a few years, and he demanded, and got, an unprecedented amount of control on how his music would be used in the film. The end result was one of his best works, exciting, dramatic, and lushly romantic, and it would foreshadow his equally remarkable score for ""North by Northwest"".It would take over thirty years for ""On Dangerous Ground"" to be recognized as the classic it actually was, and, sadly, many of the principals would never live long enough to see the film receive the attention it deserved. Martin Scorsese called it one of the most influential films on his work (""Taxi Driver"" incorporated many of the film's visual and character elements, and would be scored by Bernard Herrmann, as well).The film is, if not a masterpiece, among the handful of the 'film noir' genre of films that truly deserve to be called 'Classic'!",510,0,,0,No reference

Diane Lane plays a mother of a teen (anna Paquin) just reaching puberty. While hubby is back home working, she meets the sexy 'blouse man' and has to battle her two sides, since she had never really had a normal teen dating experience, getting pregnant and marrying young. Her role strongly parallels her more recent in ""Unfaithful"", where she was apparently happily married (hubby Richard Gere) but gives in to temptation when she meets a young French used book dealer. The critic Ebert has a complete review of the movie.  SPOILERS follow ... Lane's character seems to give in too easliy to the temptation, and seems a bit too irresponsible for a mother of a teen daughter and a young son, especially while sharing a vacation cabin with her husband's mother. Seems all the vacationers know about her and the blouse man, and she has to be gone for long periods (e.g. trip to Woodstock) so the grandmother will obviously know too. Those actions don't seem consistent with the character we see the first part of the movie. Still, she does have the torrid affair, when her husband finds out and asks ""what are your plans with the blouse man"", her answer of ""I don't know"" naturally throws him into the mode of ""As far as I am concerned, you don't exist anymore."" I don't know if I could have started up a relationship again, had I been him, but in this movie we see them beginning to try.

1200,1691909,2008-08-30,rmax304823,Verboden liefde (1932),6.0,"Those of us who came of age when Barbara Stanwyck projected an image of hand-shaped steel on screen -- a lesbian, a stern matriarch, or whatever -- may not be aware of how fragile and accommodating she was in her earlier films. Never a sex symbol or an actress who shot out the lights, her performances were always reliable and sometimes quite accomplished, as in ""Double Indemnity."" Alas, her earlier movies don't have the appeal today that they once had. In the early 1930s there were ""women's pictures,"" and this is one of them. At the time there were only radio serials like ""The Romance of Helen Trent,"" but now anyone interested in romantic dramas can turn to afternoon soap operas or LMN.In ""Forbidden,"" Stanwyck is a homely librarian (meaning mainly that she wears glasses and wears drab garments) who rejects the advances of a newspaper editor, Ralph Bellamy, and decides to take a fling on a Caribbean vacation. On the cruise she meets Adolph Menjou, a debonair rising politician who has an affair with Stanwyck (don't they all?) and this results in a child. Pretty risqué for those days.The problem is that Menjou is a married man with a crippled wife and -- well, all kinds of complications ensue. They end with the wife adopting the illegitimate child and providing her with a good, substantial home and a college education.Now, Ralph Bellamy has not disappeared from the story. He hires Stanwyck and she finally decides to marry him, but not out of love. I was certain her affections would be transferred to Bellamy, who would turn out to be an understanding and forgiving kind of guy. But no. For the first and last time in my entire life I was wrong. Bellamy digs up the illicit connection between Stanwyck and Menjour (who are still seeing each other) and intends to expose Menjou out of spite. Menjou is now running for governor and I think we all know what that means. I don't have to draw you a picture. A couple of slugs from Stanwyck's .38 solves the problem. But governor Menjour, on his death bed, guilt ridden, signs a confession of all his misdeeds and leaves half of all he own to Stanwyck. Ever the stout heart, she rips up the bequest and throws it in the trash. With a brave smile, but without any money or family or social standing, she strides off to face the future, her honor untarnished. (I hope she does better than I did under similar circumstances.) It's not a dumb movie. The director, Frank Capra, who brought us a couple of gems ten years later and a good series of war-time documentaries, is no dummy. He's a populist but not a nasty minded one, and if here he was still learning his craft, his generosity and his respect for his adopted country shows. (He was born in Sicily.) ""Forbidden"" will interest most those who are interested in intrigues and the social dynamics of small groups of acquaintances. It's also of historical value because we see Stanwyck before she became the Stanwyck so many are familiar with from ""The Big Valley"" or whatever it was, and because this is one of Frank Capra's earlier efforts.",541,0,,0,No reference

He could ask for anything but what he asks for takes Belldandy by surprise he asks her to stay with him! With the contract made she stays with him and some people aren't too happy about it; most notably a girl who is upset when Belldandy becomes the most popular girl in college and a boy whose advances she rejects. As time passes Keiichi and Belldandy are joined by Belldandy's sisters Urd and Skuld Urd is keen to kindle romance between Keiichi and Belldandy while Skuld is determined to stop that happening so they can return to Heaven. If dealing with rivals and siblings wasn't bad enough a demon turns up with the intent of bringing misery to the world.This series provided quite a few surprises; it is a seinen romantic comedy but it manages to avoid excessive fan-service and despite the fact that it involves a boy living with three girls it doesn't feature the usual harem hijinks. In fact the romantic elements are very chaste. This might disappoint some people but I found it a refreshing change and the gentle comedy was most enjoyable. The real strength of the series is its characters; in particular the three goddesses; Belldandy is one of the mos delightful anime characters I can think of, Urd's slightly over the top personality provides plenty of laughs as does Skuld and her various inventions.

With better characters, a connection with them would have caused the horror scenes to be even more of an impact. Now for the positives. Visually, this is a stunning film. Reminded me of South Korean Cinematography in some instances, with the bright colouring and almost surreal atmosphere. This is a film of ""seeing less is best"" so there are no CGI creatures in this film, which is great because most of the time, CGI can take the realism out of it. You don't actually get to see the dangers in focus, its all a blur, but by the way its filmed, you know that the threat is very intimidating. Film making of this technique is not common in the world dominated by CGI. So its great to see that some directors still like to let the viewer use their imagination.

1210,3721999,2018-08-25,Kolobos51,Blood Feast (2016),4.0,"This movie is a remake of a classic Herschell Gordon Lewis film. Lewis, known as the Godfather of Gore, did extreme and extremely silly high concept horror films like The Gore Gore Girls and 2000 Maniacs (remade as a Robert Englund flick about a decade ago). I'm not a huge fan of his and my interest in this movie had more to do with its marketing, which swore it was a hardcore, over-the-top gore film. Honestly, though, this movie seems almost apologetic for its intense content. It tells the story of an unstable, American restaurant own that moves to Paris with his wife (Caroline Williams of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Hatchet 3) and college aged daughter (Sophie Monk of The Hills Run Red). He is going broke and goes off his meds then promptly begins hallucinating, believing he has been ordered by an Egyptian goddess to perform a blood sacrifice in her name. He begins murdering and cooking young people while his suspicious wife noses around and his oblivious daughter is romanced by a local cop. Blood is spilled but it's often slightly off camera, which is disappointing. The opening is pretty awesome and the finale is great but the entire middle is a snooze. A lot of this has to do with a dull supporting cast and a stilted leading man. Caroline Williams and Sophie Monk, the only two actors I had heard of beforehand, are great but they're kind of peripheral to the movie for the most part. I can't really recommend this movie. The trailer is stronger than the actual film and I found it kind of boring overall. There's certainly worse out there right now so I guess, if you're desperate, give it a look.

The girl becomes a really good fighter, knocking all the competition out in the first round, but ultimately meets her match in a dirty-fighting opponent who breaks her neck in the ring and sentences her to a fate at the hospital, where she loses her will to live.Here we have another one of those non-deserving Best Picture Winners. Let's not get carried away here -- the film is ""pretty good"" at best, and certainly watchable, but this is nothing more than a retread of so many other boxing and heart-tugging tearjerkers that I'm surprised so many embraced it. All I can guess is that a lot of people never saw the ROCKY films, LOVE STORY or TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. This is a familiar old tale: ""Struggling boxer wants to be managed by the best, and an aging old trainer wants one more shot so he hesitantly accepts the challenge. And then, toss in a heaping helping of sudden tragedy from other tearjerkers which causes everyone to pull out their handkerchiefs and Kleenex"". The End.The assets of the film come from the performances of Eastwood, Swank, and also the dependable Morgan Freeman, along with heart and soul and a collection of characters that really relate to one another well. Clint's trainer in particular is given a complex nature, as he goes to church every day to talk to his priest and is haunted by the mistakes he feels he's made during his years. But Swank's Maggie turns out to be a real phony in the end, as she decides that life without one of her limbs is no longer worth living. I don't have a problem with that decision in and of itself, but up to this point we've been hit over the head again and again that Maggie is one tough cookie who never says ""no"" and doesn't stop fighting. I didn't buy for a minute that she'd give up the real fight of her life when the going really got tough.",407,0,,0,No reference
1213,2841195,2015-03-30,rj522,Taxi Driver (1976),9.0,"I find it important to go back and watch movies that came out before the present day. It's very interesting to compare parts of the movie to the events during that film's time period. Additionally, some of the best movies came out well before the birth of the modern generation. This is a masterpiece by director Martin Scorsese. I believe that Taxi Driver is one of those movies that you have to see. It features one of the best actors of all-time in his prime; Robert De Niro makes a stunning performance as the character ""Travis Bickle"". You can look deep into his role from a psychological perspective. Travis Bickle is a Vietnam-War veteran who seems to suffer from serious depression and insomnia. To cope with this, Bickle becomes a taxi driver who drives night and day. He doesn't carry much of a social life and even separates himself from his passengers. When he's not picking up fares, he is watching XXX movies. When Bickle falls for Cybill Shepherd's character ""Betsy"" he watches her from outside until deciding to go into the poll office and ask her out. He later takes her out on a date in which they go to a XXX movie. Betsy is disturbed and never talks to him again. This is a perfect example of how the war negatively affected him and has made him incapable of proper social interaction. Another thing is how deeply affected he is by seeing Jodie Foster's character ""Iris"" be thrown around like a piece of property. He isn't just disgusted by it, he is sickened with her pimp ""Sport"" and holds a grudge against him. Later in the movie Bickle leaves Iris money before he attempts to assassinate the Senator. After the assassination plan fails, Bickle storms in the brothel on a vendetta and eventually kills Sport, among other gangster characters. All of these events occur because Bickle has a rather special hatred for people he doesn't agree with. Beside the psychological terms, it is just overall an interesting movie with Robert De Niro at his best. Some parts of the movie are iconic as well; like when Bickle is standing in the mirror at his apartment and coins the phrase ""You talking' to me?"". That scene in itself is excellent because Martin Scorsese told De Niro to improvise and that was the result.",394,0,,0,No reference
1214,704515,2003-12-26,bob the moo,Mulan (1998),,"Mulan is a tomboy of sorts - not something that is looked for in a Chinese wife, and she causes constant worry and dishonour to her family.  When the Huns attack China, the Emperor commands each family to put one man forward to fight.  With Mulan's aged father the only man of the family it looks like he must fight, but Mulan dresses as a man and takes his place.  With the help of dragon Mushu, Mulan overcomes her status as a woman to help take on the Hun.I wasn't sure I would like this film as I have grown a little tired of the Disney formula of `songs, romance and smartassed comedy sidekicks', which Mulan sticks to pretty well, however I did really enjoy this film.  I think it was mainly because of the sweep of the story, the big battles and the majestic feel to the movie.  The plot moves swiftly and felt like it was all over too quickly.  It has the usual mix of laughs for parents and kids as well as having quite a good story behind it all.The only major weakness is the songs.  I didn't exactly start tapping my feet at any of them and, while they are not bad per se, they aren't great and after a few lines I was wanting to skip past them (but couldn't - it was showing on TV).  Asides from these the film is funny and quite dramatic and is good fun to watch.  The cast are good.  Ming-Na is a good Mulan while Murphy rehearses for Shrek with his smart mouthed dragon that gets plenty of good laughs.  DB Wong is a good actor but has a `straight' role and doesn't distinguish himself.  I was worried at first by the presence of Harvey Fierstein, but he did good work and wasn't half as irritating as he usually is.With colourful animation that is good without being Pixar, this is a good cartoon that is fun, funny and, at times, dramatic.

1218,1460224,2007-06-08,PoisonKeyblade,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007),10.0,"Because it was filmed back-to-back with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, fans were expecting something spectacular with the third and possibly final installment of the Disney franchise Pirates, entitled Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, but the movie obliterates any expectations. With the previous two incredibly successful installments, Disney has found themselves with a surprise hit series in Pirates of the Caribbean. The second film is the second highest-opening movie of all time, right beside Spider-Man 3, and the first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, held surprisingly solid DVD sales. With the third installment, At World's End, Disney has made another perfect film with very few flaws that is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best film Disney has ever put out. For a sequel, At World's End actually has quite a story to tell, filled to the brim with bulky subplots and interesting characters. This installment manages to rise above the other big blockbuster sequels like Spider-Man 3 and Shrek the Third by utilizing a great cast, sensational acting, and an always-interesting plot. One may go so far as to say that there wasn't a single dull moment in the entirety of the film's 2 hour and 50 minute runtime. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush, and Bill Nighy return once more for this final installment, joined by Chow Yun-Fat in a memorable role as the pirate Captain Sao Feng of Singapore. The third installment is once again directed by Gore Verbinski, who crafted the previous two installments into incredibly memorable blockbuster films with breathtaking cinematography. The story of Pirates of the Caribbean has always been the most important part of the series. Without the plot, the movies would be merely uninteresting and boring, especially considering their length. At World's End sees Elizabeth Swan, Will Turner, Captain Barbosa, and company on a journey to fetch back Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker. Everything leads to a meeting of the Pirate Brethren at Shipwreck Cove, an epic battle concerning several ships, and the closure of many major plot lines. Keira Knightley takes center stage in this installment, and she never ceases to amaze with her excellent acting. Johnny Depp also has lots of screen time, and he is fantastic as usual in his role as Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom takes on Will Turner with a somewhat darker perspective this time around, and it reflects the overall darker tone of At World's End. Chow Yun-Fat plays Captain Sao Feng with creepy sincerity, and he brings life to the character with his zany accent and attitude. At World's End starts off on a serious note with the creepy but catchy song ""Hoist the Colours"", and it fits with the most insanely sinister installment yet. Some of the scenes in At World's End are extremely creepy, but, as always, the film has a great sense of humor, mostly displayed through Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa. So much is going on at one time in the movie that it is easy to get lost, and it may take several viewings of the film to truly understand everything. The length of the movie never seems too long for all that you get out of it, and the pacing is nearly flawless. The movie starts off a little bit slow, but once Jack Sparrow comes in, the movie really gets off its feet. There is also a crucial scene after the credits of the movie, and it is definitely worth sitting through. Also keeping with the other films, At World's End features breathtaking cinematography and a much darker tone than the others. If you can only see one big blockbuster hit this summer, see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End; it's full of action, frightening situations, well-written characters, and more story than anyone can imagine. It is certainly the best among the three big 'May' movies, Shrek the Third and Spider-Man 3. Unlike the other two films, At World's End was not disappointing on any level; it delivered in every category, and then some. The great acting and the new characters also contribute to making this the best installment yet, and the greatest big blockbuster movie of the entire year, and many years past.

Its fair to say the performances from all the actors and actresses is A1. and I award Full marks for that.It reminded me about the movie Matilda. However I have mixed reactions and opinions as regards the story, I have never read the book so i cant comment on how much it relates to the movie maybe they have tried to keep it really close. As i don't know I'm going to talk on. I feel there could be a lot more in the movie because it had SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE BETTER! for instance I would have liked to have seen Carrie as if it were surviving at the end for the simple reason she put in so much effort to cope during the story and more interaction between Carrie and Sue because Sue tried to make up with her as if for the whole movie she wants to talk and help Carrie. Although I was thinking more real justice rather than just plain revenge, I suppose revenge can be still fun OK so i just feel there could have been definitely more in this area and as a result I have deducted 2 marks.The movie is classed as a horror/drama, horror is usually scary with some gore. There has been some gore with the bloody fingers, the period and the killing for the pigs blood but gore is kept to a minimum which I like because too much gore looks unrealistic so its grand for the squeamish. Coming to the drama side all the actors and actresses they put on a brilliant performance I could definitely feel the emotion.over all I would definitely recommend this movie for one of those lazy nights of sitting in front of the fire eating popcorn and drinking a beer.",346,0,,0,No reference
1224,4007656,2019-02-11,hampersnow-28905,Discarnate (2018),6.0,"The original title of this movie was Shapeshifter, which gives you a better idea of what it is about. A foreign production with mainly American actors including the always excellent Josh Stewart, but even the foreign ones are speaking English. As a horror movie goes it's OK, the acting is decent, there are scares, gore, some thrills, just not enough of any of these things. It doesn't stand out as being anything really different from so many other horror movies today, and is completely forgettable. The Shapeshifter creature is excellent though, a genuinely frightening creation. It seems some money was spent on effects, this isn't a movie where monsters look like a rubber mask from a dollar store. Just a shame they didn't add in more scares and a more coherent script. By the time it ended on a somewhat preposterous note, I'm still not sure what was going on. 6 stars for being somewhat interesting, not a bore, a great monster, and a cut above the many low budget horror films floating around.",174,0,,0,No reference
1225,2128278,2011-05-21,darrhling,Jack Goes Boating (2010),7.0,"Seymour-Hoffman's directorial debut is a well-rounded little film about being positive no matter the circumstances; the possibility of a solution at the end of the tunnel and the value of perseverance.Jack Goes Boating relates the tale of four people whose stories are wound together. The premise is simple: one couple throwing a blind date for the other two parties. From this seemingly basic starting point, the characters undergo transformations, all of which are sprinkled with life-lessons and positive philosophy, all the more poignant for its stark backdrop of lower-middle class life. In this sense, there is a feel of La Vita è Bella about it, although admittedly Jack Goes Boating is not quite in the same league as the former.Phillip Seymour-Hoffman pulls off some typically sensational acting, as does Amy Ryan, with a complicated emotional role which she executes very well indeed.All in all, a high-class film, totally worth watching, but not something that leaves you with the feeling it ought to have won Best Picture.(Please take the time to say whether you found this review useful.

You had to focus on the storyline and concentrate on what was happening, not enjoy what was going on around you.  However, in the film I found it extremely easy to follw both the storyline and how each of the characters was dealing with the certain situation.  I was able to focus on how everything fell into place; everything was just as I imagined.  Although there were a couple of differences that had me startled.  The factor of the captain living on the island with the boys and how they were fully aware that he was in trouble, and quite sick.

1230,894522,2005-01-30,MovieManMenzel,Spanglish (2004),7.0,"So I finally got around to ""Spanglish"", another movie that I kind of wanted to see but was never really a priority but since January keeps releasing only one or two pieces of crap each weekend then I figured I catch up on one of the last movies of 2004 that I sort of wanted to see. So here is my review of ""Spanglish"" Spanglish is about a Mexican woman named Flor (Paz Vega) who snuck over the border to live in California. Very believable because I live in California and trust me this stuff happens everyday. Anyway, she lives in Los Angeles working two jobs and is bringing up her daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce). So one day she decides that she needs a new job so she goes with her friend on a job interview at the Clasky residence where they need a new housekeeper/babysitter. Needless to say, Flor gets the job however the problem is that she only speaks Spanish and they only speak English so that's how they get the title Spanglish. The family however can't understand her problems or talk to her until one day when she sees how badly the mother Deborah (Téa Leoni) treats her daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele)and then she decides that she needs to learn English so she can help her and understand what's going on in the family. The movie then turns into a movie about cultures clashing and families failing apart but without giving away any details touching, and funny moments do follow ""Spanglish"" was actually a nice surprise. I was really thinking the worst about the film when I walked into it. I haven't really liked anything Adam Sandler has been in since ""Happy Gilmore."" I mean some of his movies are passable but nothing I would sit down to watch again or buy on DVD. ""Spanglish"" was actually a pleasant surprise because not only was Sandler not in it as much as the trailer lead me to think but he was actually not making any googoo gaagaa noises and didn't try to be funny. The movie basically focuses around a dysfunctional family. I love movies about messed up families. I found that out just the other day. Because I just think of the TV shows I like i.e. ""Cracking Up"" and ""Arrested Development"" both are about dysfunctional families. But ""Spanglish"" is also about two different cultures clashing together, the poor Mexican culture and the rich white-collar culture. It's nice to see a film that was pretty nicely paced and did not feature the run of the mill script. A movie that for once starred Adam Sandler in a main role but wasn't dumb funny but actually was creative funny and touching. I also thought the ending was halfway decent. It didn't end the way I thought it was going to.

The writer and director for ""Spanglish"" was James L Brooks who is a master at film from directing and writing some great movies such as ""As Good As It Gets"", ""Broadcast News"", and ""Terms of Endearment."" He wrote and directed a good movie here not as good as the ones I just listed but it was still good compared to most of the crap that is released into theaters. I liked the script more then his directing because of its character development and the interesting lives of these characters. You really felt like you knew each character and was involved in their lives. You laughed at the characters and felt bad for them as well. The story at first seemed to be very typical but then moved past that point later on. The ending was very un-Hollywood. You came out of the theater with some questions, for yourself, the viewer to ponder about. It was very much like life, which is what I liked about it. I also have to say thank you to Mr. Brooks for finally getting Adam Sandler to act normal for a change and show he can act if he wants to however he will never be anywhere as good as Jim Carrey in ""Eternal Sunshine"" or ""The Truman Show"" but this movie again proves that we don't want our funnyman actors to act serious because although ""Eternal Sunshine"" received great reviews and ""Spanglish"" received better than average reviews but neither did that well. Each was well received but neither made money. You throw out crap like ""The Longest Yard"" into theaters and it will make at least $100 million but these movies can barely make its budget and that's a shame.

So In Conclusion, ""Spanglish"" isn't flawless, it has its problems like being a tad to long and taking to much time to get to the point at times but as a whole it's a pretty well made movie. There's nothing award winning about it, just a good little movie to watch, have a few chuckles with maybe even shed a few tears with. It's a good movie, some really funny moments, some touching moments, and a good not so typical story. I couldn't help think throughout the whole movie that the main actress who played Flor was Penelope Cruz but it was Paz Vega. They look so much alike its scary. This movie will most likely be one I will be adding to the DVD collection so I do recommend it.

MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Spanglish"" is a 7/10. A great couple movie which both can enjoy!",905,0,,0,No reference

This short opened well and quickly became one of the superficially stronger shorts of the evening.  The direction is punchy and creates a real sense of tension and drama.Even better is the use of soundtrack.  It is urgent and broody and really does create a good sense of tension.  Sadly the plot is weak when viewed from outside.  I may have misread it but I wasn't gripped and didn't have enough information to get into the character or the plot.  However it has great energy and urgency that kept me interested.The performances are so-so and seem more focused on swearing and acting tough like all the movies they watched growing up rather than bringing out character.

1233,1963780,2010-05-11,Angus-8,Beyond Sherwood Forest (2009 TV Movie),4.0,"I don't have any new Simon Cowell to add, so I'll only go into depth about what was good about this film: not a whole heck of a lot, but it was batting 1.000 when the guy came up with the idea. (I'm really interested in this genre since Origin Systems stopped producing Ultima) That idea was that a young woman who comes from another world (a murky one at that!) is somehow cursed for breaking a law and spends part of her day as a winged monster. A cynical government-actor captures her to use her as a weapon. This story is woven into a Robin Hood one. (How that last part works, I don't know, but I guess someone else does.) Unfortunately, the movie kept putting me to sleep (figuratively) so I missed some of the finer points of the plot.The acting and English accents have a serious credibility problem, the dialogue isn't exactly chancy, and sometimes the seams show on the CGI. I don't think the plot was executed in a very good way either. There was a romantic dimension, but that looked like they remembered to throw it in at the last minute.There are a couple of things that I can respect a movie like this for: one is that it didn't have a lot of silly modern slang (the worst was a single ""a little help""). Also, while Katharine Isabelle does show a lot of skin, there is no bona fide nudity (possibly because Isabelle refuses to do any). A movie like this should be going for such cheap thrills, but it doesn't. Good for it!I wish it was Steven Spielberg who'd gotten ahold of this idea. I think it would have made a fine story, but instead what we have is typical Canadian B.",299,0,,0,No reference
1234,558581,2003-02-13,wmorrow59,Kick In (1931),9.0,"Here's a real treat for buffs: Clara Bow's last film for Paramount, a very rare title, never on TV or video, but recently restored and shown to audiences for the first time in decades. Some rediscovered movies fall short of expectations, but Kick In is a winner all the way, well written, well acted, and relentless. This is a tough crime melodrama which puts most of its characters through absolute hell, tightening the screws as it goes along. Although it's a Pre-Code talkie from the early '30s, Kick In plays more like one of those bleak, paranoia soaked thrillers from the late '40s, and that may have been a prime reason behind its failure on its initial release. This was not a movie set to gladden the hearts of Depression-weary viewers. A solid noir like this one can be an exhilarating experience in its own way, but ""feel good"" it's not, and audiences of 1931 just weren't buying.

On top of that, star Clara Bow had been through a great deal of personal (albeit highly publicized) hell of her own just prior to the production of this film, and was under a terrible strain during the shooting. It's said that she was barely able to complete the picture, and its failure ended her long and lucrative association with Paramount, an association far more lucrative for the studio than for their biggest star. It's a terrible irony, for the film is one of Clara's strongest talkies. There's little evidence on screen of her shaky emotional health, aside from some facial puffiness noticeable at times, and her role suits her talents perfectly. But it's also true that much of the weight of the drama is carried by an outstanding supporting cast, especially Regis Toomey as Clara's husband, Paul Hurst as a mean cop, and ever reliable Donald Crisp as the Police Commissioner. Buffs will also recognize the ill-fated James Murray, star of King Vidor's silent classic The Crowd, in a significant role.

Viewers unaccustomed to Pre-Code movies may be startled by the frank depiction of a key character's drug addiction. This coke addict -- or ""snowbird,"" as he's called -- is depicted as pathetic and weak, yet pitiable. This is no Reefer Madness, it isn't campy or laughable, and the writers weren't stupid. The people who made this film seem to have known what they were talking about. We don't smirk at naive dialog here, because there isn't any. There are occasional touches of humor in Kick In, but the plight of the characters is so harrowing that for the most part we watch tensely, hoping for the best, but dreading the outcome. I won't give away the ending, but it might surprise you.

Flaws? Well, the judicious use of background music at key moments might have helped (it would be another year or two before film scoring really kicked into gear), but, on the other hand, the lack of music might actually be a plus: the naturalistic soundtrack heightens the suspense, making the experience similar to watching a gripping stage drama. Pictorial quality is amazingly good, thanks to the fact that the restored prints of Kick In derive from the original nitrate camera negative. Happily, this is one case where a movie emerged from a long hibernation looking just about as good as it must have looked when it was new. And unlike some of those aforementioned rediscoveries, i.e. the disappointing ones, Kick In is a movie that seems to have improved with the passage of time. We can only hope this film finally gets the wide exposure and attention it deserves.",601,0,,0,No reference

It's a drama, without being unrealistic and drawn out. A comedy, with a sincere, very relevant message.Set back in 1962, we meet Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), an impulsive, profanity using, Italian-American bouncer living in New York. After he loses his job, he gains an interview with Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an enigmatic, African-American pianist, who offers Tony the task of driving him around from gig to gig. The problem being that Dr. Shirley was to be playing down south, where people were not as accepting of his race. Tony agrees, even though the job will require him to be absent from his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) and his two young sons.Tony and Dr. Shirley seem opposites in many ways, however they are both outcasts, and use their differences from the normal folk to connect with each other. Through the movie, Tony becomes more accepting of people that may have seen worlds apart to him before, and he becomes protective of Dr. Shirley, and strives to become more in touch with his emotions. Whereas Dr. Shirley realizes just how different he is from most African-Americans at that time, him being a rich pianist with no wife or children to take care of. With Tony's influence, Dr. Shirley also becomes less uptight and willing to let loose every now and then.Green Book has something for everyone and deserves all the awards attention it has been getting.

Everything about this movie, from the Gregorian chanting to the monstrous nanny to the creepy child to the dogs of hell, evokes a sense of suffocating, ominous, impending doom. This tension and horror ratchet up step by step until the viewer is overwhelmed by the unknown approaching apocalypse. Every death is accompanied by slow-mo shattering glass (first time that was done), shocking mechanics, and strong premonitions. Even the slo-mo bullet was real- the novel and clever cinematography, like the tyke's bike view, puts you into the skin of the characters. The reluctant Peck, the dawning Remick, the persuasive Warner are dragged progressively into the hideous center of an eternal mystery that they are powerless to resist. The most terrifying scene ever filmed is the attack of the monstrous demonic nanny and I still, when people talk of their mother, have to suppress a yell, ""I saw his mother: his mother was a jackal!""I saw this movie at it's world premiere my second day in LA, after a legendary cross country odyssey, I picked up some hitchhikers in New Mexico, and they put me up.

1244,1924436,2010-02-07,howard.schumann,Voy a explotar (2008),9.0,"Though it appears doubtful that J.D. Salinger's classic paean to teen-age rebelliousness, ""Catcher in the Rye"", will ever be filmed, Mexican director Gerardo Naranjo's I'm Going to Explode (Voy a Explotar) provides a kindred spirit in teenage Roman, an updated cinematic expression of Holden Caulfield's search for authenticity (though one with decidedly more reckless abandon). Naranjo, who studied film at the American Film Institute with another up and coming young director, Azazel Jacobs (Momma's Man), owes a big debt of gratitude to the French New Wave, yet his I'm Going to Explode stands on its own as an involving tale of two lovers on the run, never feeling derivative or redundant.Produced by actors Gabriel Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna from Y Tu Mamá También, I'm Going to Explode rises above its youthful flaws with energy, dark humor, and personal style, and an expressive spontaneity that makes it a rich and deeply moving experience. If Holden had a partner, she might have resembled 15-year-old Maru (Maria Deschamps), a troubled outsider with a rebellious spirit. Bored and feeling very much alone at her suburban prep school in Guanajuato, Maru is an outsider who empties her soul each day into her diary, aching for someone who understands her longings. Her world comes alive, however, when she meets Roman (Juan Pablo de Santiago), the disaffected son of a well-to-do right-wing politician.A bright, impulsive, emotional, and unpredictable young man, Roman seems to delight in seeking his father's (Daniel Gimenez Cacho) attention by getting kicked out of every school he is enrolled in. Now in the same school with Maru, they meet at a talent show in which Roman pretends to commit suicide by hanging and Maru feels an immediate camaraderie. She writes to a friend that ""He exists, but I also made him up,"" and says that ""the best part is that he's angry."" Roman has similar feelings for Maru and it does not take long for the two free spirits to plan a runaway from a world they can make little sense of. Roman, in melodramatic fashion, pretends to be abducting Maru while flashing one of his adored guns but the reality is less exciting.Although they both want their parents to think they are far away, in reality they are hiding out in a tent on the roof of his father's house, sneaking downstairs to corral the necessities of life when his dad, Maru's mother, and sister (who have made themselves part of the rescue team), are not at home. Fortified with plenty of wine and rock music which they listen to with dual headphones, they are clearly having fun at the expense of their self-involved but legitimately frightened parents who are thrown off the trail by hysterical phone calls from Roman, replete with misinformation. In a startlingly insightful sequence, Maru expresses her conflicts about having sex with Roman, fearing that she will lose her power over him and be taken for granted if she ""puts out"" (why most Hollywood teens never think about that is a mystery).Like most adolescents, one minute they express powerful emotion and seem grown up, the next minute they are squabbling or not talking because of inconsequential jolts to their ego. When Roman and Maru do have sex, it is very erotic because they are at first so hesitant and tentative, perhaps the way we all were the first time. Ultimately, they steal a car with the idea of going to Mexico City but, as in real-life, it does not always work out according to plans. Surviving an unnecessarily melodramatic and predictable ending, I'm Going to Explode is a film of sensual delight and pure exhilaration and Deschamps' performance as the more mature protagonist keeps the film from descending into juvenile hi-jinks.",623,0,,0,No reference

Early on in the film the female lead is groped at school and is told she is asking for it because of the length of her skirt. She then gets a detention as well as her attacker and the whole thing becomes a joke when he then puts on a short skirt to apologise! The main character is shown in her underwear three times in the first 30 mins and is completely objectified by male characters each time. The romantic interest (her best friend's brother) is possessive and controlling and this is made out to be romantic and a sign of how much he cares about her. The 'OMG' girls are one dimensional bitchy stereotypes and they are the only other females that get any screen time. It's just SO AWFUL. Watch 'To All the Boys I Loved Before' or 'The Edge of Seventeen' instead for something a bit more progressive and with some emotional depth.,194,0,,0,No reference

On the one hand, this film is interesting in its depiction of ""Arabia"" because it was probably one of the first, and makes it a rather romantic setting. Today, we tend to think only of war and strife.

But also, this is no all-happy romance. In the novel, Sheik Ahmed sexually assaults Lady Diana; in the film, the assault is only suggested as a curtain closes on Sheik Ahmed and Lady Diana before there is any physical contact between the two, but this is still questionable subject matter for the time. George Melford said, ""We have handled the frank scenes in 'The Sheik' so delicately that I think the censors will be the only disappointed reviewers.""

1249,2119029,2011-04-30,Creepy-Suzie,I.M. Caravaggio (2010),9.0,"Director Derek Stonebarger's first feature length film, I.M. Caravaggio was a sexually-charged pulsing skewer into the life of a genius, entwined with the seedy underbelly of the Las Vegas streets. Almost like a drug induced spiral, Ian Milano's tormented life sprang uncontrolled with the onset of fame and acclaim, spurning violence, mayhem, and death in his wake. This was a story of an art prodigy with a history of sexual and mental abuse, a demented sense of self worth, and a cynicism that aged the character beyond his years. Milano's innate ability to express a stark reality of one's soul through his intentionally subversive works resulted in something beyond controversy. This character mirrored the real life of the artist Caravaggio, and since he was actively learning of the artist it is ambiguous as to if this was fully intentional, by chance, or a combination of both.The film starts running literally. Ian Milano is no stereotypical starving artist. In fact he has to lose six pounds to make weight for his college wrestling match, and running through the dirty, urine stained North Las Vegas streets impacts him with sights and experiences that define his art. Ian Milano is not the stereotypical jock either though, and even endorphins can't cheer up this angst ridden sociopath. Actually there doesn't seem to be a character in the film that you could say is typical or two dimensional. Care was taken to develop even the smallest roles without bogging down the plot which cranked forward with the pace of an uncontrollable locomotive. I was enthralled and I was moved. A broken jagged pool cue becomes a makeshift spear during an erotic rage of shame, and the last remaining threads of sanity or decency are lost as Milano strikes out repeatedly like a wounded animal.The scene faded to black and the credits rolled and I just sat there. The director and cast took open questions and I just sat there. The seats cleared around me and still I sat. What did I just see? I know I cried, but why? Why did this film impact me to this extent? I had to ruminate on it. I continued to do so all night despite the light hearted festivities around me. However, I was fortunate enough to be able to ask the cast and crew attending the screening some of my burning questions.The most noticeably interesting part of the movie was the coloration. I've never seen a film designed in such a way. The colors were bold, but not like a 70's throwback at all. This was different. It was subtly grainy, but not like a Grindhouse film. It was barely noticeable and minute. The film's Director of Photography, Victor Tapia, told me the desired outcome was that the entire film would have the look of a Caravaggio painting, and this was achieved with intense lighting during the shoot and by heightening the level of contrast and adjusting color during editing. Stonebarger used a professional Panasonic digital studio camera during the filming of I.M. Caravaggio. His directing style is easily comparable to Aronofsky.Colin Huse, I.M. Carravaggio's Audio Director added that the encompassing, penetrating, robust sound swirling through my ears during Stonebarger's amazing visuals had the intent to be bold, much like that coloration, and to completely fill the space wherever the film would be shown.The acting skills of Ryan Eicher were extraordinary. He was the complete personification of the mood, style, and elegant malice that was I.M. Caravaggio. I was surprised to find the genuinely cheerful Ryan Eicher to be, well, ""normal"" upon speaking with him. He was the polar opposite of the Ian Milano character, and was only 19 years old when his performance was shot. Although he stated his ultimate goal is to direct, I would go so far as to suggest that film in general would suffer a loss similar to the day that Vincent Gallo uttered ""I stopped painting in 1990 at the peak of my success just to deny people my beautiful paintings; and I did it out of spite."" were Eicher to not continue with his acting endeavor. This young man has a long career ahead of him. Kudos to director Derek Stonebarger for pulling this exceptional performance from his lead actor and the rest of the I.M. Caravaggio cast, and kudos to him for being the auteur and soul of my new favorite film.",733,0,,0,No reference

1251,3093928,2016-06-13,emma-nickle920,Pride (I) (2014),10.0,"Having viewed this film the day after the events of the Orlando shooting, the story and characters left a scarring view of the continued struggles of the LGBT community. This film was truly mastered with pride and a willingness to discover the truth in danger, but not allow it to destroy the humor in life. These upbeat characters live in a time of Thatcher's reign and oppression, but the love for life is never truly gone. The message behind the story is more than a memoir, it is a respectful approach to the efforts of men to support the very community it had been repressed by.The actors do a wonderful job of approaching these characters with open arms, heart, and all the while displaying the emotional duress that this community still suffers from today. Bill Nighy's reserved character shines through, his development of a closeted man to a openly enthusiastic supporter is something I'm sure some may relate to. Even Joe Gilgun's quite Mike is an important supporting actor and character. His presence is enjoyable and quite frankly relatable to me. As he stands on the sidelines, he still does his part. Every community member's personality type seems to be represented in this wonderful film. The ending is heartfelt and certainly tugged a bit at my heart after seeing Sian's success, and knowing of Mark's loss. This movie is inspiring and everyone should view it. It may open the eyes of the ignorant, and inspire the supporting. Overall, I highly recommend this film especially after the mass shooting in Orlando and keeping those events in mind.",266,0,,0,No reference
1252,1636026,2008-05-14,larry-411,Somers Town (2008),10.0,"""Somers Town"" is one of the sweetest little films of any festival this year. Shane Meadows (""This Is England""), directing from a strikingly authentic Paul Fraser script, has crafted a winner with so much to like that it's hard to know where to begin.The film takes its name from an area of inner London where the landscape is dominated by monstrous natural gas tanks and the construction of a station for a Channel Tunnel rail link. Marek (Piotr Jagiello) lives in the shadow of the humongous structure and spends his days shooting photographs of the area and trying to stay occupied as his father toils away at the construction site. Like many in the town, they are Polish immigrants who came looking for work and stayed. One day Tomo (Thomas Turgoose) appears out of nowhere, a boy Marek's age who is little more than a street urchin from the East Midlands to the locals. A fortuitous meeting between the two boys forges an unlikely friendship. Tomo is a tough punk (or thinks he is) and Marek is introspective and sensitive -- it's the basis for a character arc which is classic in the coming-of-age genre. We know where they're going -- how they get there is at the heart of ""Somers Town."" The outstanding supporting cast includes a sweetly understated Elisa Lasowski as Maria, the local girl who they both fall for, and the hilarious Perry Benson as Graham, who provides much of the film's comic relief (not that it needs any more than the boys already provide) as an eccentric neighbor who is literally indescribable. But it's the on screen chemistry between the boys which makes ""Somers Town"" the gem that it is. In a wise casting move, Turgoose and Jagiello, both 15, are the same age as their characters. In one scene where the two party a little too hearty, Meadows simply directed them to have fun and let the cameras roll. The result is one of the best scenes in any film I saw here this year.""Somers Town"" surprises at every turn. The film is shot completely in black and white save for the final sequence. It's a rarely used technique which, although unfamiliar at first, quickly falls away as the viewer focuses on the budding relationship between Tomo and Marek. After awhile we don't even notice the absence of color, for the story itself provides a rainbow of feelings. This device also makes lighting somewhat irrelevant, which allows a focus more on the characters rather than the look of the film. The soundtrack is simply a perfect match, with a playlist of tender acoustic songs that seems tailor-made for the narrative.Everything about this film says ""gentle and tender,"" from the friendship between the two boys -- what could almost be described as a platonic love story, to the longing the two have for Maria -- the object of affection who is always just out of reach, if only by age and maturity, and even to the father's tentative but loving relationship to his son -- in stark contrast to typical American films where the two would be constantly butting heads.More than anything, though, there is no doubt that Turgoose and Jagiello carry this film on their young shoulders. Never have two young teens needed each other at this point in their lives as much as Tomo and Marek, and their relationship is so incredibly funny and touching that it had audiences in stitches and had me smiling from ear to ear from start to finish. It's no wonder that Turgoose and Jagiello each received the jury award for Best Actor here at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where ""Somers Town"" had its North American Premiere. ""Somers Town"" is a charming and funny gem with a heart of gold.",632,0,,0,No reference

Essentialy because it feels as if you are watching two different films.The first stars Alan Rickman. It is brilliant, its funny, entertaining and captivating, mainly due to Alan Rickman himself.The second is terrible. It involves Kevin Costner trampling all over one of the best loved characters of British folk lore. He comes across as rather lame overall, lacking the strength and emotional resonance that Robin Hood should have.As much as I love siding with the antagonist as Alan Rickman often entices us to do, it simply shouldn't be that way in a Robin Hood film. Kevin Costner as Robin Hood comes across poorly on his own let alone juxtaposed with such a strong performance from Alan Rickman.No Robin Hood film should ever be a film where you want the Sheriff of Nottingham to stab Robin Hood to death, preferably as Alan Rickman suggests with a spoon. Yet it is.So yes, if you want to watch Alan Rickman in a great performance do watch this film. It is worth it in that respect. Just be prepared to put up with a poor performance from Kevin Costner.This is not a good Robin Hood film, but it is a good Alan Rickman film.",213,0,,0,No reference

The original rough that I was allowed to view was in all comparison, the next, in combined thought My big fat Greek wedding/El Mariachi/ and Clerks all rolled into one.

The casting is awful, every next character looks like he needs to be hit with a brick. No one looks their part, they look like idealized and stylized caricatures of their part. The writing and dialog is hilariously bad, which appears to have been written at grade-school level. Even Patton's smart remarks which are supposed to be the highlights of the film have me rolling my eyes at their genuine lack of wit or humor. When the film's being funny, it feels like an old sitcom. When the film's being serious (when?) it feels like an old sitcom. You could put a laugh-track to this movie and play it in serial as a week-long comedy-drama miniseries. The violence doesn't feel violent, the battles don't feel dangerous, the locations feel like a sound stage. Coppola dropped the ball hard on this one.
And finally.. George C Scott is a ham. He is the Tom Hanks of his day, an overrated 1-dimensional, 1-trick-pony. Opening speech, that was great. I want generals to speak like that to their men. However his other monologues don't hold up to the shark-jumping opener. The speech about the battle between Carthage and Rome comes to mind, and made me want to hide under the table. Everything about his performance, from his absurd cartoonish frown to his absurd cartoonish grin, a voice no one anywhere has ever spoken in, and the sloppy way he fills out his uniform: a Marine Corps veteran who doesn't look like a Marine, how do you like that.

If this were by a young new director, or just by anyone else, people would like it more.The annoying thing about Diary of the Dead is the voice-over, which tends to get a bit preachy and repetitive. But still, it raises questions and valid points. Why do people blog and shoot everything with their cell phones? Of all the hip new movies shot with a digital camera, like Cloverfield or REC, this is the least shaky and pretty easy on the eyes. It also shows (as part of the message of the whole movie, I'd say) that anyone can make a movie these days for any amount of money. What's the point of doing a 300 million dollar movie if any talented student can do the same with two cameras? Anyway, this is a zombie movie, so let me get to the bloody point. There's quite a lot of violence, although the headshots and some of the gore are digital, which is a shame and a departure from the great Tom Savini stuff I came to know and love. But still, it's better and far more entertaining than Land of the Dead, so I encourage you all to go for it. Maybe it was because I had low expectations based on the rating, but I really loved this movie.

1264,2958189,2015-10-19,stephendaxter,Back to the Future Part II (1989),9.0,"Next up in my series of BTTF reviews is Back to the Future Part II, the film that wowed everyone with a glimpse at what the future could possibly look like, and although it is clearly nothing like it was envisioned in 1989 it is still very interesting to see the 'future that could have been' come to life on screen. Back to the Future Part II did what all sequels should do, it was larger in scale, it took bigger risks and it took the series to a whole new dimension by really focusing on the use of time travel. Now although it was bigger and the timelines got a whole lot more complex, topping the first film was nearly impossible but they tried their hardest and it payed off, making this film also an instant classic. Like its predecessor, this was also an endlessly entertaining film, still capturing the same humour that the first film did so well it manages to make you laugh consistently throughout. The characters of Doc and Marty again have great comedic timing and their chemistry is like no other film and it adds to the realism of these characters relationship. Whilst also maintaining that comedic aspect, the film also does spend quite a bit of time getting pretty serious and developing the plot for later in the film and for Part 3. This film had the daunting task of having to top the first one, and how do you do that? Rather than going 30 years in the past they decided to go 30 years into the future. But why stop there? lets go 30 years into the future then 30 years into the past in another timeline and then 30 years into the past again just to mess with people. Although there was a lot of jumping between timelines in this film it managed to hold itself together very well without seeming like it was moving too fast. As expected, with all of these time jumps, the timeline of events is going to get a little more confusing, but the film i thought did a pretty great job at keeping audiences informed as to what was going on. There were a few exposition scenes that were a little too 'heavy' on information that could have been spread out a little. Having just watched it for like the 10th time, it all makes sense to me but for a first time watcher it may take another viewing to fully grasp the timeline changes. A very minor thing in a film that still does time travel better than 98% of time travel films out there. One of the things that this film is remembered for is its visualisation of the future. Seeing all of these technological advancements in terms of cars, and clothes, and shoes, and hover-boards was incredibly mind-blowing for me when i watched it so you could imagine how it must have been for an audience that was even further away from that possible reality. It was a very interesting contrast with other more dirty dystopian futures you see in most sci-fi films, the cleaner, brighter look made it so much more memorable. Like i said, they are the scenes everyone remembers, the hover-board chase scene is an iconic action sequence that will never be forgotten, the sequence in Marty's future house was amazing seeing all of the small but significant advances in technology that people would only dream of. Many people often forget that the film also does represent the future in a very dystopian environment, and i thought in its own way, that was a very interesting juxtaposition to put in this film. Although it wasn't as fun and lively as seeing the cleaner future it was definitely interesting to see how greed and a money driven future would look like. Looking back on it now, i would say that the Dystopian representation of the future isn't any more far off than the Cleaner, more technologically advanced one, just saying. But one of the most impressive sequences for me was when Marty and Doc travel back to 1955, the setting of the first film, and have to go around this time period whilst avoiding their other selfs from the first film. This is what really wowed me in terms of the incredible film-making and visual effects that were used in order to make it look like they had actually travelled into the setting of the first film without compromising what the first film set up. The shots were placed perfectly and the use of footage from the first film in combination of recreations of scenes from the first film from different angles was incredible, and for a film released in 1989 it was amazing to see. It also has what i think was the most exciting and fun ending sequence of the series that had me laughing, and in suspense the entire time. It closes off the story of this film perfectly and sets up the next film in a similar way to what the first film did. It may even be one of my favourite movie endings ever, i get goosebumps every time i watch it.Again, the attention to detail was incredible, with fantastic call-backs to the first film and the little details that connect the alternate timelines timelines together, and also some foreshadowing for what is to come in Part 3, Robert Zemeckis' love for this world and these characters is on show. In the end, this film goes bigger, it goes to more places and it retains everything you love about the first film. It does lose some of that magic that you feel when watching the first film but it is still a masterpiece and a classic that even helped to elevate how good the first film was upon return viewings. - 9",977,0,,0,No reference

It was the realistic way it depicted issues about the common man, and how it always made us realize the importance of what we already have, instead of making our life miserable running after what we don't. Filmfare award winning Writer & Director Manoj Lalwani's is back with yet another slice of life movie about frustrations and temptations of a common man, Wass Up Zindagi.The story is told through 4 friends going through relationship issues at different stages of family life - break-up, newly-married, parenthood and mid- age crisis. The best part is how each story line is treated in a light heart-ed manner, making the movie watching experience a breeze and yet at the end, touching all the right chords in your heart. All of the situations are something you can identify with, something you may have faced or seen in your family. It gives you a different perspective of looking at your life, makes you realize importance of family and showing you the way to handle crisis situation – face it and not run away from it.The locations are beautiful and the songs are woven well in the narrative. The performances of the lead actors are spot-on, with Prem Gadhavi (Dharmesh) as always stealing the limelight with his great comic time, having the best lines in the movie. Ravish Desai (Bhavesh) looks earnest and convincing as somebody who is deeply in love but at the same time how somebody can be swayed by a little distraction and monotony. Gaurav Paswala (Rehaan) brilliantly brings out the frustration of not being appreciated and losing one's direction. The rest of cast is equally competent, making it a great all round show.A movie to watch with your entire family",322,0,,0,No reference

The movie seems to be pure nonsense. Hope, Naseer comes out with something better in the future. As someone has already pointed out, do you really expect a brother talking to sister about his ""Exploitation tool""? Similarly, a sister talks to his mother about the brother being naked. This is not Indian movie. The title made me think, this might be a light comedy movie like ""Jane be do yaaron"". But, I must admit that it totally failed my expectations. The star cast is OK (expect Paresh Rawal, who is best in any role). I could not really see any value in showing Konkona Sen Sharma bathing and talking to Jimmy Shergill for so long. Jimmy Shergill seemed to be uncomfortable in his role. Overall, the movie is nonsense. Please do not waste your time in watching it.",162,1,,1,Reference to other reviews
1270,3023747,2016-02-07,leonblackwood,Life (I) (2015),4.0,"Review: I wasn't that impressed with this movie because it seemed to drag after a while and the main characters were quite depressing. The only reason why I didn't fall asleep is because I wanted to know how Dennis Stock took those amazing shots of James Dean, which have become iconic. The whole film is based around that brief period when Dennis is trying to get the perfect photographs for Life magazine, so there isn't much depth to the characters. When you see the real pictures at the end, it is quite emotional, especially after watching there brief journey together but the whole pace and feel of the movie isn't that great. The storyline is quite simple! Robert Pattinson plays photographer, Dennis Stock who goes to a celebrity party to take pictures and he bumps into upcoming star James Dean, (Dane DeHaan) who he finds interesting as a person and really wants to photograph. After convincing his boss, John Morris (Joel Edgerton) that James Dean is going to be a star, he goes ahead with the assignment before the release of East of Eden. James agrees to the assignment and they both become friends, while John is taking pictures of James whilst travelling from Los Angeles to New York and to Indiana. John gets to see the many different sides of James Dean but he has his own personal problems, especially with his young son, from his ex-girlfriend, who he very rarely sees. After there 2 week road trip together, James Dean becomes a huge star, after the release of East of Eden and Dennis Stock pictures, during that period, become a big hit. 7 months later, James Dean sadly dies in a car accident, which enhances the popularity of the photographs. To this day, the photographs are still as popular as ever, worldwide and they captured a time in both of there life's, when they didn't know what path that was yet to come. The director didn't set out to make a biopic about James Dean but you can't help wanting to know more about his life at that period. Everybody knows that he died in a car accident at a young age, so after seeing such an in depth look into those 2 weeks of them being together, you really want to see the aftermath of how those pictures touched a wide audience after his death. With that aside, Dane DeHaan did play James Dean extremely well but Robert Pattinson just seemed to be acting the same as he has done any many of his previous movies. Anyway, it didn't go down to well with audiences, judging by the movies takings but it's good to see how these famous pictures actually got taken. I can understand why people would find it boring and un-entertaining because it does take some time to get to the point, so it has to get an Average mark from me.Round-Up: Robert Pattinson, 29, hasn't really made a big impression on the big screen since the Twilight series, which is mainly down to his small range. Water for Elephants and the Rover were decent movies but Map to the Stars, Bel Ami, Cosmopolis and Remember Me, weren't that great. At such a young age, he still has time to pull himself out of the Twilight shadow, like Daniel Radcliffe and Harry Potter but he needs a project that will bring him out of his comfort zone, to show that he really can act. Anyway, this movie was directed by Anton Corbijn, 60, whose mostly known for his music videos, with artist like Depeche Mode, U2, Bryan Adams and Metallica. He also directed Control with Sam Riley, the American with George Clooney and A Most Wanted Man with the late Philip Seymour Hoffman so he has covered many genres behind the camera. This movie really did need something to perk it up, because its very one toned and quite glum in places. I don't know that much about the actually story between James Dean and Dennis Stock, so I can't say how close he was to the true story but if your bringing something to the big screen, you really need to cover a few elements to keep the audience interested, which this movie sadly didn't. Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $1.1millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/dramas starring Robert Pattinson, Dane DeHaan, Joel Edgerton, Ben Kingsley, Peter Lucas, Lauren Gallagher and Kendal Rae. 4/10",743,0,,0,No reference

Harrison Ford would be a moder-day equivalent. You almost can't go wrong with a Flynn film, and he's great in here, too, in a very understated role. Often he played the dashing hero, but here's simply a rock-solid, calm leader of men during a bad situation in Burma.""Objective, Burma"" has as its director Raoul Walsh, a Hollywood legend, a man who directed ""White Heat"" and dozens of other famous movies. The cinematographer is James Wong Howe, one of the best ever, a man labeled for his craft as a ""master."" The music is by Franz Waxman, a man so talented in the movie business with his scores that he has his picture on a stamp as one of the six ""Legends Of American Music."" The transfer quality on this Warner Brothers DVD is fantastic. The pictures looks near-high-definition. It's absolutely amazing for a film this old.So you see, the film has a lot going for it.Having said that, and being objective about it all, not everything is peaches-and-cream. It took 42 minutes before any action occurred so modern viewers might get a little antsy wondering when something is going to happen. Also, normally, I like black-and-white with my classic films but with so much jungle footage, this would have looked awesome in color. With the great detail in this transfer, and with all the leaves, branches, trees and grasses, it all jumbles together many times and is almost hard to decipher.As in most classic-era WWII films, there is a lot of talk and that involves the typical clichéd characters, such as the so-called comedian from Brooklyn. These stereotypes always had corny names and made all the corny jokes...the only ones in the platoon. In this case, it's ""Gabby Gordon"" (George Tobias). The rest of the crew is predictable but a lot of the dialog is dated, so be ready for that.Actually, I thought the screenwriters had a good mix of talk, suspense and action, not overdoing any aspect except for the beginning, which needed more punch. For today's audiences, this 142-minute film would be too long. This movie would definitely be appreciated most by a post-60 audience. It's a ""Blackhawk Down"" length movie, but not ""Blackhawk Down"" action or intensity. That's not a criticism, just a description so that those who haven't seen this movie know more about what they're going to get.I found this to be a good movie, a solid film, but not as a great as I had read over the years. That's the problem with a film getting great hype; as a late viewer to the film, I wound up expecting too much and therefore was slightly disappointed.

It sucked!  I hated it!  I went to the movies and paid eight bucks to go see that piece of crap.  Really badly written!  The first one had the psycho killing his victims, while bringing up the musical talents of people, listening to their albums.  Okay, now that part was minorly entertaining, at least enough to laugh at.  Then, I had to watch parts like when he chased one victim down the hall of an apartment, with a chainsaw roaring.  What a load of crap! Give me a bring.  As if nobody in the whole apartment complex had heard it, while she's running and screaming.  So now, this brings me to the sequel.

At first, her character came off slightly annoying and I didn't know if I was going to like the movie or not.  As the movie went on, there wasn't too much of a plot.  Basically, she wanted to work aside William Shatner's character, because he studied serial killers.  Those who got in her way, in her opinion had to die.  She was going to get the job and that she that.  There was no alternative.  I must say by the end of the movie I found myself enjoying the movie, laughing and actually at sick as it sounds cheering her on as she knocked one person off and then the next.

1285,1106157,2006-01-08,liquidcelluloid-1,Popular (1999–2001),,"Network: WB; Genre: Parody, Comedy, Satire; Content Rating: TV-14 (for strong language and suggested sex); Available: DVD; Perspecive: Modern Classic (star range: 1 - 5); Season Reviewed: Complete Series (2 seasons) At Kennedy High School the divide between the popular and the unpopular is a big one. The jocks and the cheerleaders run the school, lead by school sweetheart Brooke McQueen (Leslie Bibb) who begins having an existential crisis handling the expectations that go with her reputation (which proceeds her). On the other side of the social fence is aspiring journalist Sam McPherson (Carly Pope) who despises the way the school falls all over Brooke. When Brooke's father and Sam's mother fall in love and decide to move in together, it forces the two rivals under the same roof and their social circles collide in a bloody war where all-important social status is at stake. At least until season 2.While that set-up is crucial to understanding the premise, it doesn't come close to doing justice to the sheer mad-capped fun of ""Popular"". Full-length parody is a nearly impossible thing to sustain over the course of a series, but creators Ryan Murphy and Gina Matthews have found a way to have their teen show and make fun of it too. The show successfully manages to balance being a genuine dramedy about the real pressures of today's kids (at school and home), while at the same time ripping a satirical hole into the clichés of high school shows elsewhere on The WB and Fox that take for granted their audience and depict the teen years in a shallow, stylize fantasy world.Every great show has a breakout character. ""Popular"" has no less than 3: cut-throat ambitious villain Nicole Jullian (Tammy Lynn Micheals, perfect), weird, androgynous science teacher Bobbi Glass (Diane Delano, perfect) and, spin-off worthy Mary Cherry (Leslie Grossman, brilliantly over the top and sporting an intentionally phony southern accent). It is fun to watch the entire series almost be swallowed up by Mary Cherry's bizarre universe. I would also submit that Harrison John (Christopher Gorham) is a 4th break-out character if only because he is written with such stark realism. I cannot recall another young character with such a consistently cynical, and brutally honest, outlook on his life, feeling as real and relatable as Gorham and the writers make Harrison.But the cast is actually huge and miraculously corralled onto the same page. Sara Rue and Ron Lester in the ""fat friend"" roles, Tamara Mello as the activist, Bryce Johnson as airhead football player Josh Ford , not to mention Pope and Bibb fully capable in the leads. All characters based in TV clichés, given a depth and subtly by the actors.It is a pure delight watching ""Popular"" start out like a fairly normal smart-aleck, name-dropping teen series and get progressively crazy with each episode. Stories become insane, more cartoon-like, loosely plotted, deliriously far-flung and difficult to even describe. Few shows are willing to go as far out there as ""Popular"". Not that it is a mess. Blessed with the strength of a perfect cast, great performances, a genuine affection for its characters and a solid foundation, ""Popular"" gets away with murder. Things, like food fights and slasher movie parody, which are usually botched and wind up embarrassing other shows.Parsing out the episodes it feels like there was an internal battle going on between the network that wants yet another dry teen drama, and Ryan Murphy who swings for the stratosphere each time. I love ""Tonight's the Night"", ""Fall on Your Knees"", ""Booty Camp"", Queen B"", ""Are You There God, It's Me Ann-Margaret"", ""Fire in the Hole"" and particularly, the water-cooler worthy ""Caged"", ""Hard on the Outside, Soft in the Middle"" and the season 1 finale ""Two Weddings and a Funeral"" - possibly one of the wildest hours ever to grace TV.In season 2 it appears Murphy has lost that battle as the show becomes a full-fledge drama - occasionally throwing an odd bit Grossman's way and expecting her to carry the entire hour's comic weight. I want to hate the show for this, but it by then the characters have just been so well established we care what happens to them. Season 2 wants us to sympathize with Bobbi Glass. There is even a delving into Mary Cherry in the surprisingly touching ""Joe Loves Mary Cherry"". The season 1 magic is briefly rekindled with the spectacular ""The News of My Death Has Been Greatly Exaggerated"" centering around the death of a major character as well as Murphy's obsession with voguing, 80s jokes and hair.My only real complaints would be that the show looses its grip on Sam's motivations in the finale episodes and that it goes into flat-out After-School Special territory with soap box episodes ""Fag"" and ""Ch-Ch-Changes"". A sarcastic ""thanks"" go to the WB for ending the show on the cruelest possible note. Although a final intense throw-down between Brooke and Nicole is immensely satisfying.With its flaws, ""Popular"" is still one of the most original, hilarious and smartly written high school shows you will see. The hours are rich and full, perfectly paced with one unfolding revelation after another. The pop culture references come as fast and furious as any animated series. I guess, somewhere there was a study done that says teenagers like their shows dry, straight and melodramatic. ""Popular"" is the antidote. A lively, toe-tapping, diabolically entertaining live-action cartoon that shows teen audiences a respect they deserve. ""Popular"" may not go all the way, but it takes the high school show further than I've seen it before - and does so with style, wit and a cynical heart on its sleeve.

The project was the brainchild of publisher Len Mogel, who ended up bringing it to producer Ivan Reitman, who agreed to join the project on the condition that he have total control and bring in his own writers, Dan Goldberg and Len Blum, with whom he'd worked on ""Stripes"". The result is an anthology of lush, vivid, sexy, violent, adult stories linked by the ongoing journey of an evil glowing green sphere dubbed the Loc-Nar, which brings chaos to all those with whom it comes in contact. Some of the episodes are taken from the magazine - ""Soft Landing"", ""Den"", ""Captain Stern"", and ""So Beautiful & So Dangerous"", some are originals - ""Harry Canyon"", ""B-17"", and ""Taarna"", and they're united by the common thread ""Grimaldi"". The movie is an amazing collaboration between artists such as Richard Corben, Berni Wrightson, Mike Ploog, Howard Chaykin, Chris Achilleos, and Juan Gimenez; the total crew of animators and support personnel numbered around a thousand and was based around the world - NYC, LA, London, Ottawa, and Montreal; also among the credited writers is Dan O'Bannon of ""Alien"" fame. The assemblage of voice talent is solid - John Candy, Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty, Harold Ramis, Richard Romanus, Percy Rodrigues, Al Waxman, Jackie Burroughs, Don Francks, etc. ""Harry Canyon"", a noir style story of a cabbie of the future, ""Den"", a tale of an adolescent's fantasy of derring-do as a muscular hero, and the adventure saga ""Taarna"" are definite standouts. Even though it's true that animation has come even further in the past 30 plus years, and a film of this sort would look even better now, there is still much to admire with the look of this film. Some of the stories are actually worthy of feature length in their own right, and they're all equally engaging and often humorous, with Levy and Ramis priceless as a pair of chatty aliens and Candy endearing as a sex starved robot. (In fact, some of the SCTV guys provide voices for a few characters.) The awesome soundtrack includes contributions from such artists as Blue Oyster Cult, Sammy Hagar, Cheap Trick, Riggs, Stevie Nicks, and Journey, so the movie is just as appealing that way as it is visually. And one doesn't necessarily have to fit into the obvious target audience to get entertainment out of it. It moves along quite well and clocks in at a reasonable 91 minutes long.

The women is grateful and shows her thankfulness in her very own way to one of the two men (after the other is out of the picture quickly). Even if you are not fluent in Italian, it is probably not entirely necessary to have subtitles for this one as the talking is not essential in understanding the film and basically the last 15 minutes, maybe more are void of dialogue anyway, with the exception of one sentence by the male protagonist at the very end. If you can even call him ""male protagonist"" that is as the entire film is really all about Debora Calì's performance. It is very explicit, yet somehow very tastefully done, even if I would not agree with guy calling her the most beautiful woman on Earth. It probably helps if you are slightly horny when watching this film and I can see how male audiences like it more than female. It is an erotic tale from start to finish basically.

There is a big problem with poverty in Missouri especially in rural areas where job options are limited and good education may be harder to obtain; my home town also struggles with it but has some advantage in being closer to the jobs in Kansas City( if the car expense can be covered). These rural areas really suffer when they are outside of public busing distance to big city jobs as Rich Hill is and when too many factories have pulled out. Even my hometown is outside of busing limits so people have to carpool or have very good working car and afford the gas to get to the job in Kansas City and live off it. Living in the city is no picnic either as Kansas City rental rates are getting higher and higher for rent and apartments can be quite scary compared to knowing everyone in your smaller town(I am experiencing that now as pay raises are not matching inflation at all.)

1296,496228,2002-10-02,edzelr,RoboCop (1987),,"I would have to say, RoboCop is the most violent movie of all-time. The violence of other Sci-Fi and Action films were no match for this one, the scene where Peter Weller's character Murphy gets killed slowly is the most unbearable scene for me. I could accept violent deaths like Impaling, Decapitation and other causes of death as long as it's quick and it's the bad guy who's dying. But there's nothing compared to this especially when I lately discovered in the internet that there was a symbolism of Christ's crucifixion in Murphy's death scene.And I would have nightmares on that death scene dreaming that it was me getting shot and killed slowly, anyway the plot is dark and has black humor on it. The movie is an instant classic becoming the most violent film ever made, so violent that there was one true story in my home country where a 9 year old boy was watching this film but his maid wants to watch a TV show which made the kid angry ending up shooting her.RoboCop 2 was a dud but RoboCop 3 did a good job finishing the trilogy despite making it a PG-13 rating (which I really did appreciate too) and Peter Weller's departure for the title role.

I love this film to death, It is an bad-ass kick-ass action film. It is my third favorite action film in the ""Rambo"" series. I grew up with this movie. I love all Rambo movies to death there is no bad Rambo movie in my opinion. I love Sylvester Stallone's returning as the legendary John J. Rambo.It has a fast pacing and goes fast around. Rambo with his Hoyt Archery bow and C4 tip arrows are memorable for me. Rambo fires his explosive C4 tip arrow at the helicopter gunship and destroys the Russian helicopter that is my favorite scene in the film. I think it is the most judged and underrated action movie of the 80's bad-ass kick-ass action film.Rambo hunts Specnaz commandos in the cave with bow and arrow blue cyalume light. Fires with his bow an arrow an attached blue cyalume light at the Soviets commando in the cave. He hunts Specnaz commandos with C4 tip arrows. Rambo uses M203 grenade launcher with AKM destroying an army truck. Rambo destroys the chopper with soviet heavy machine. This is my childhood movie the movie I grew up with it. Rambo is my favorite comic book hero. It was my first film I saw in the Rambo trilogy. As an action film I love it and I am going to judge as an action movie.They don't make movies like this in the movies anymore. Sylvester Stallone is in his best shave of his life, he goes under tanks and drag him self that was really difficult but Stallone was muscle so he made it. Rambo has a new survival knife a modified bowie designed and I love how he uses to cut barbed wire on the base perimeter. I love the fight between Rambo and Kourov (Randy Raney) and which Rambo uses a fly kick I love that in the film. Rambo climbs the wall without climbing equipment that is memorable and favorite scene of mine.The film was directed by Peter MacDonald and written was by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich who made 4 movies with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Jerry Goldsmith return for the music score the last time for the film, it was good but I have enjoy in the second film more. Rambo III is a fun action sequel, the Deseret scenes in the film were cool. I love that Sylvester Stallone reunited with Richard Crenna who did an excellent performance and Jerry Goldsmith who returned for making a score for this film. Peter MacDonald directed well not bad at all and I love his direction.Rambo III is the most underrated kick-ass action film I love it.

1306,701511,2003-12-19,Bruce_Cook,It Happens Every Spring (1949),,"In addition to being an enjoyable romantic comedy, this is actually a tidy little sci-fi yarn that foreshadows the 1950s sci-fi craze that began just two years later.

Ray Milland stars as an underpaid college professor who can't marry fiance' Jean Peters because he's so poor. Fame and fortune will be his, however, if he succeeds with his experimental attempts to develop a solution that causes wood to repel termites (what a concept!). But a baseball crashes through his laboratory window and destroys his equipment, botching up the solution during it's final mixing stage. Milland ends up with something very different than what he intended to make: a liquid that repels wood. He soaks a baseball in the solution and discovers that no bat can touch it!

Unfortunately he can't duplicate the accident that created the solution, so he only has one small bottle of it. Milland conceives a bold money-making scheme; he applies for a job as a rookie pitcher with a down-on-their-luck team. Using solution-soaked baseballs that repel bats, Milland throws impossible-to-hit pitches, and soon his low-ranked team becomes serious contenders for the pennant!

The special effects of the baseball hopping and looping over the bat are terrific (and the ball makes the same sound as Gort's ray in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", another 20th Century Fox film that came out two years later).

There's plenty of laughs in this imaginative, well-played little classic. Paul Douglas does a fine job as Milland's roommate and the team's catcher. Directed by Lloyd Bacon from a witty screenplay by Valentine Davies.",262,0,,0,No reference

1309,1861492,2009-09-27,lei3,Peter Pan (2003),9.0,"I grew up watching Disney's 1953 version of Peter Pan and I loved it. The story of Peter Pan brings back a lot of memories for me, and I know I would have loved P.J. Hogan's version as a kid.This particular version of Peter Pan came out when I was in high school and (I'll admit it up front) I didn't go see it when it first came out. In fact, it took me a few years before I actually sat down and watched the entire film. When I finally did, I was AMAZED at its complexity and imagery! What had taken me so long?! I think the coolest part of this version is that it REALLY delivers when it comes to the fear we've all had about becoming adults. Most of us can look back on our childhood and realize we had no huge responsibilities, no real worries, and we look back on those days with a kind of sad fondness to how simple life used to be - and we didn't even realize it.Wendy Darling is on the brink of womanhood and is fighting it with all her might. She wants to please both her parents (especially her stuffy father), but feels she is too young to give up her childhood ideals and stories. Peter Pan offers her and her brothers, John and Michael, a chance to come live in Neverland with him and the Lost Boys (who btw are all adorable in this film). Jason Isaacs is hands down the best Captain Hook that's ever been done, and the relationship complexities between Wendy, Peter, and Hook is fascinating! All the acting was extremely well done.As far as the so called ""sexual tension"" of the film goes, I didn't look at it like that. Peter and Wendy may have a little crush going on, but that all stems back to growing up, falling in love, and (ultimately) getting married. Peter cannot grow up and never will. He won't ever be able to experience that kind of emotion, while Wendy realizes that she WANTS to.As far as Wendy and Hook go, I looked at it as a mirror image of the strained relationship Wendy had with her father. Call it an Electra complex if you want, but I didn't completely see it that way...Another amazing thing about this version is the musical score. Its PERFECT. I can't even describe it in words, but it captures every moment as it should. The costumes and the scenery are also beautiful. This film touched me, and I don't say that lightly. It brought me back to when I loved this story in childhood and makes me want to be young again. Its amazing in a way, and sad in another.

1316,731962,2004-02-20,El-Stumpo,Dick Down Under (1975),,"Richard Franklin is one of Australia's greatest filmic exports, working his way from low-budget thrillers and horror pictures to overseas hits such as the Hitchcock-approved Psycho 2 (1983) and the arthouse smash Hotel Sorrento (1995). Like all successful filmmakers, however, he's bound to keep a skeleton or two in the closet (anyone remember James Cameron's Piranha 2: Flying Killers?). Ask him when he's in a cagey mood about his first film and he will wax lyrical about the ESP chiller Patrick (1977). Dig a little further and he may admit to a scandalous duet of R-rated oddities, the first of which is the only full-frontal `Aussie Western', the 1976 period comedy The True Story Of Eskimo Nell.

Max Gillies plays Deadeye Dick, peeping tom, foul-smelling bullsh*t artist, failed bushranger and all-round hopeless sack of sh*t. He teams up with champion d*ck-wrangler Mexico Pete (Serge Lazareff) after a disastrous liaison involving an irate husband, and together they go searching for Dick's sexual El-Dorado, the mythical first-rate whore and `Queen Whomper' named Eskimo Nell. They eventually come across `Nell' in a cheesy mountain hotel, and is hardly what Pete imagined, but Dick, lost in his one-eyed dreamworld, discovers the one glimmer of happiness his sad existence had denied him.

The 1973 British sex comedy Eskimo Nell had already covered the making of a fictitious softcore version (as well as a gay western, kung fu and sickly family version!) of the famous bawdy 19th Century poem by a unscrupulous smut film producer. Franklin's version, co-written with Alan (Alvin Purple) Hopgood, sticks closer to the source material and transposes the action to a more culturally iconic stomping ground: the Ballarat Goldfields, the Eureka Stockade, the snow-capped Blue Mountains. The ambitious Franklin's second unit filmed the Klondike scenes - where Dick supposedly loses his eye - outside Montreal, and some incredible location shots such as the iceflows from the Canadian far north helped win the film an AFI award for Best Photography. Come to think of it, it's hard to remember when an R-rated film looked so good!

Franklin's cast is first rate - Auntie Jack's Graham Bond briefly appears as Pete's potty-mouthed long lost mate `Boggo', and Lazareff as Mexico Pete is a soothingly familiar presence for those of us who fondly remember 70s Aussie TV. And Max Gillies, I hardly need to remind you, had his face plastered on TV every week in the 80s doing ear-tugging impersonations of Bob Hawke. During the 70s however he spent most of his career in bizarre comic film roles, and was no stranger to showing his pale underbelly - he had already played a lecherous married schlump doing a stoned striptease during the David Williamson segment of Libido (1973), so we didn't bat an eyelid over his most memorable scene in Eskimo Nell, starkers except for his ludicrously large hat, eye patch and strategically placed holster. Gillies spits out the smutty one-liners with relish, like `Have you ever stuck your d*ck in a milk pail and churned it till it's butter?' At the heart of the film, however, is the oddly touching parasitic relationship between voyeur Dick and coxman Pete, and their shared wet dream of finding the fictional lay Eskimo Nell.

Seventies sex queen Abigail was a major selling point, gorgeous as ever and totally starkers (for the first and only time on film!) as Esmeralda the Leopard-clad wife of a traveling magician who catches Pete nailing her to the floor of his `Magic Box'. After leaving the warm bosom of the Number 96 TV series she had anticipated a career as an all-round entertainer. Despite a minor hit album and single `Je T'Aime' and traffic-stopping cameos in Alvin Purple (1973) and Alvin Rides Again (1974), her greatest talent appeared to be in self-promotion.

In the rosy glow of hindsight we often forget, when looking back on the so-called liberated Seventies, that the spirit of puritanical oppression or `wowserism' more often than not reared its ugly head to spoil everyone's swinging good time. Franklin even used the pseudonym `Richard Bruce', the filmmaker's way of hiding under a brown paper bag, on his second film, the hugely successful soft-porn portmanteau Fantasm (1976). In retrospect, his film career could have been over before it started.",708,0,,0,No reference

How could such a great director put his name to a film with such stock characters. Like the guy who beams down with Kirk in the Star Treck films you know exactly who is going to die next! As soon as he says he's going to marry the girl you know she is going to die. The dialogue is simply awful and badly delivered, and Rhys Wakefield as 'Josh' the son had me laughing out loud with his facial expressions as his father was dying in his arms.

Therefore I cannot tell you if it is better than the original, equal, or worse. What I can assure you is that is an highly intense movie. You get very attached to the characters, you feel like you are in their shoes. Frustrated and lost when the car breaks down in the desert, scared and helpless when they are attacked by the mutants, angry and revengeful when they attack the mutants. If you also consider that the plot of the movie is nothing special (a family lost in the desert is attacked by mutants), the director succeeds in keeping us at the end of our seats during the whole time.

1322,3093015,2016-06-11,Rendanlovell,Warcraft (2016),5.0,"Based of one of the most popular video games of all time,'Warcraft' tells the tale of orcs and humans fighting for their world. The orcs world is dying and one big bad orc opens a portal to the human world where they can rebuild. Except, they don't want to coexist with the humans. They begin destroying towns and taking slaves. Naturally the other people inhabiting this place aren't very happy about this, and they fight back. Now, I have never played the game and am not really a fan of Blizzard games. Even though I have never played the games I feel like this movie was one for the fans. (Even though most of those fans say this isn't like the actual story.) As I watched, there were many obvious things that were fan service that I didn't get. But when these things popped up they never really stayed for to long. I was happy that the film was actually trying to be a movie instead just fan service. That being said, this is a film that many people who haven't played the games will be frustrated with.It never goes into much detail about, really anything. Very few things are explained or spoon feed to the audience. While I appreciate when a film does this, this one didn't really know what it should and shouldn't explain. There are many things that, because I am not a fan of the game, didn't make sense. This is unfortunate because a film shouldn't be dependent on the thing that it's based off.You shouldn't have to read books or play games in order to get what is going on. This is the main problem with the film. There are far to many things that are left too vague. I shouldn't have to go through an extraneous process to get why a character is doing the thing that they are doing. I really had no idea who these people were and the film didn't do anything to show me who that person is.Even after two hours with these characters I was no closer to knowing them. Not a single one had any personality other than the motive that drove them. Not knowing or caring about the characters made the middle portion of the film very tedious. It cut between almost every main characters backstory back to back in the most sloppy way possible.It would show us a boring scene between two or three bland characters chatting about who knows what only to be cut off by a terrible transition. This happens nine or ten times. It seemed like the film knew it's characters sucked so it just jammed extraneous nothing into the middle and hoped you didn't notice. It made the 2nd act of the film so incredibly boring and tedious to site through.If you were to pull the majority of the second act from the film you would actually have a pretty good fantasy flick. For a movie that is being panned by critics it does a lot right. Most notably thanks to Duncan Jones and his direction. Because holy crap is this film pretty to look at. What I loved about it was despite the large use of CG It never felt out of place.This is mainly a product from having the majority of the sets be practical. Being in an environment rather than in front of a green screen seriously helps you believe that it really exists. But a lush world would be nothing without stirring music to capture the feel of the environment. And it does that very very well. This is made even better by the great cinematography. Watching as the camera navigates between giant book shelves or take on perspective shots is pretty cool to see. Doing this shows a level of grace and maturity that you don't see from many other directors today. It showed that Jones really cared about what he was doing and the effort put into every shot makes that sing true.Is it a perfect movie? No. But is it the disaster most critics are calling it? Of course not. The level of effort put into the technical aspect is unmistakable. It's very well directed and offers some really stunning visuals that your eyes can feast on. That being said, its story is pretty messy. It's uneven, poorly edited, and overstuffed. It tried to cram so much content in the film that it was impossible to really get involved in what was happening. If you're a fan definitely go see this but if not, it's probably best to stay away.",765,0,,0,No reference
1323,4393266,2019-09-08,jboothmillard,The Diary of Anne Frank (1959),7.0,"I've always heard of the diary of Anne Frank, she and Samuel Pepys are always mentioned as having the most famous diaries in history. I was most interested in seeing a film about her, and this is one, although perhaps not as well-known as it should be, is based on the successful Broadway play, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, A Place in the Sun, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically, in 1945, at the end of World War II, in an attic above a condiment factory in Amsterdam, Otto Frank (Golden Globe nominated Joseph Schildkraut) has returned with Miep Gies (Dodie Heath) and Mr. Kraler (Douglas Spencer), office workers who shielded him from the Nazis. He is now all alone, and the diary he was looking for, written by his youngest daughter, Anne, is found, he reads the words written by Anne three years earlier, during the Holocaust. The action flashes back to 1942 Amsterdam, where shopkeeper Kraler hides two Jewish families, the Franks and the Van Daans, in his attic above the factory. Holland is occupied by the Nazis, and there are increasing persecutions against Jews. The Frank family: father Otto, mother Edith (Gusti Huber) and daughter Anne (Millie Perkins), share the hiding space with the Van Daan family: father Hans (Lou Jacobi), mother Petronella (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Shelley Winters) and their teenage son, Peter (West Side Story's Richard Beymer). The families are given strict warnings that they must remain silent during daylight hours while the workers are below them. Kraler delivers food when required, and Otto gives Anne a new blank diary as a gift, in which she chronicles her thoughts and feelings about her family, the incarceration, and general things in the world. Throughout their time in hiding, the families occupy themselves in any way they can, including reading, drawing and games, and communicate when the workers have gone, and Nazi soldiers are not prowling the streets. The family are later joined by Anne's sister Margot (The Silence of the Lambs' Golden Globe nominated Diane Baker), who is home-schooled. Kraler later brings the families a radio, which serves as their ears onto the world. Soon after, he asks them to take in another person, a Jewish dentist named Albert Dussell (Oscar nominated Ed Wynn). Conditions outside are dire, with many Jews suddenly disappearing and shipped to concentration camps, hopes sinks for the families. An argument occurs about food supplies diminishing, due to the amount of people, but this argument is cut short by a prowler breaking in. The people in the room fall silent, the thief is startled when cat Moushie knocks something over, he grabs a typewriter and flees. A watchman notices the break-in and summons two police officers, who search the premises, shining their flashlights onto the bookcase that conceals the attic entrance. Moushie again knocks something over, the officers are reassured that the noise was caused by a common cat, and they leave without finding the hiding place. In 1944, Anne is on the cusp of womanhood, she finds herself attracted to Peter. Kraler mentions something that suggests workers may be sensing something strange going on in the attic, Dussell dourly comments that it is just a matter of time before they are discovered. In April 1944, amid talk of liberation, the Franks watch helplessly as more Jews are marched through the streets. Tensions mount, but then word comes over the radio of the Normandy invasion. Heartened by the news, everyone apologises for their harsh words, and Anne dreams of being back in school by the fall. Upon hearing that the police have found the stolen typewriter, Anne writes that her diary provides her with a way to go on living after her death. Peter says he cannot tolerate the situation and Anne soothes him by reminding him of the goodness of those who have come to their aid. Their conversation is interrupted by the sirens of an approaching police truck. Anne and Peter hold each other, certain of their impending arrest, and passionately kiss. German uniformed police break down the bookcase entrance to the hideout. The film returns to 1945 as Otto tells Miep and Kraler of his long journey home after his release from the concentration camp. He sadly reveals that only the day before he learned from a woman, who he met in Rotterdam, that Anne is dead, caused by typhus fever. He then glances at Anne's diary and reads, ""In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart,"" and reflects upon her unshakeable optimism. Also starring Orangey as Mouschi, Charles Wagenheim as Sneak Thief, and the voice of Edmund Purdom as the British Radio Announcer. Perkins gives a sweet performance as the innocent German-born Jewish girl forced to hide from the Nazis, I can see why Winters, putting on an accent, won the Oscar, and there is good support from newcomer Baker, Schildkraut and Wynn. Anne Frank's diary has been translated and sold millions of copies and been adapted in many forms to stage and screen. This film you can tell is based on a play, as relies almost solely on the interaction between the characters in one location, the set is its own character, and the camerawork is impeccable, I admit it is rather long and obviously talkative, but it does drip you at the rights moments with the moments where they could be caught, all in all it is an interesting drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Alfred Newman, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",979,0,,0,No reference

1327,1150709,2006-03-11,EUyeshima,Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004),8.0,"Political activist Michael Moore has certainly honed his craft as a documentary filmmaker and concurrently raised a firestorm of extreme feelings about the Bush administration. Since receiving boos at last year's Academy Awards ceremony for calling Bush a ""fictitious President"" who was leading us to a ""fictitious war"", he has fast become a touchstone not only for the agitated left but for all those who have felt increasingly alienated by the imperial hubris of the current administration. Whether you like this film or vehemently hate it will depend far less on the quality of the film-making (which by the way, is excellent) as it does on how you plan to vote in November's election. Ignore this film at your own risk, as it is a powerful indictment creatively executed. Better to view it and discuss its implications, as it won't go away thanks to Moore's constant and savvy media campaign. He was fully aware of the coming firestorm and given his history, I'm sure he welcomes it as his agenda leaves no room for historical context or an analysis of facts or debate. It's a brilliant blame game and frankly quite a convincing one at that. As a filmmaker, Moore has become far less didactic than he was with ""Roger and Me"" or even ""Bowling for Columbine"". Instead, he has become an almost subtle alarmist and a first-rate filmmaker.Mercifully, Moore is far less visible in this documentary as his first-person rantings and attempts at ridicule can get tiresome even if the treatment was deserved. The one exception is his admittedly humorous attempt at the end of the film to get U.S. Congressmen to enlist their children for Iraq on their way to work. Otherwise, his presence is felt in the calm yet pointed narration. The film starts with a compelling argument for the illegitimacy of Bush's election. This was actually the most revealing sequence, as we go beyond the chad controversy into all the odd connections and situations that appeared jerry-rigged to ensure Bush's victory. I dare anyone to watch this part and justify not voting in the next election. Moore then goes into the murky, under-the-table relationship between the Bush and the bin Laden clans before he became President, especially the suspicious way the FBI decided to fly the entire American side of the bin Laden family out of the U.S. two days after 9/11 without holding any of them for questioning. Whether his conjecture about the triangulation among the Saudis, the Bushes and oil is true or not, it has credibility in the way it is presented. This sequence catapults us into the grim reality of war, showing dying Americans and Iraqis, and speaking with a few of the thousands of casualties at U.S. hospitals who feel betrayed. There is a shocking sequence that follows a Christmas eve interrogation of a seemingly unsuspicious Iraqi family, as well as another one with U.S. troops ridiculing hooded detainees near Samara (sadly paralleling the humiliations that occurred at Abu Ghraib). Finally, Moore does bring the conflict home with a sadness quite familiar to anyone with recollections of Vietnam, when the heretofore devoted military supporter Lila Lipscomb reads a letter from her son who was killed in Iraq, noting: ""He got us here for nothing whatsoever."" It is probably the most predictable moment in the film but also its most personal.What resonates most in the film are images most of us never got to see on the news, like the series of African-American congressional members being turned away for their pleas of invalidating the Florida election results; or Marine recruiters manipulating small-town, low-income teens in Flint; or most infamous, the time-lapsed seven minutes as a slightly perturbed Bush reads ""The Pet Goat"" in front of a Florida kindergarten class. Praise or vilify Michael Moore, but it is difficult to deny that much of what he does claim is at minimum strangely coincidental and at worst immoral. A perfect example in the film is the passing of the U.S. Patriot Act, where at least some of the material in the USA Patriot Act had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved long-sought items on the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass Congress, but which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration assurances that they were essential to fighting terrorism. It is hard to stomach that kind of logic.Moore has grown significantly since ""Roger and Me"" in 1989 and not just around the waistline. Believe it or not, this is not the most damning film that he has done, just the most publicized and certainly the best timed in light of the upcoming Presidential election. Moore places less emphasis on espousing his opinions this time around and more on facts, figures, quotes and actual footage from real events that actually make the viewers decide for themselves. The film is not perfect, not nearly, but it is important viewing. My recommendation is to see this film, then read John O'Neill's grudge-laden ""Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry"" and see which one you find least objectionable to lead the country.",853,0,,0,No reference

The cast of ""Tombstone"" was well-picked. Kurt Russell was very adept at playing the lead as Wyatt Earp, a mean yet loving man when it came to his brothers. Val Kilmer was excellent as John ""Doc"" Holliday, a sometimes amusing yet at heart a very serious killer. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson was one who convinced viewers well that she, as Wyatt's wife, was a bitter, unhappy lady. Dana Delaney-and what red-blooded male could not be taken with her?-was very appealing as the actress who became Wyatt's love interest in no time at all, and she his. Powers Boothe, Stephen Lang, and Billy Bob Thornton each fit into each one's individual role well. All of these contributed greatly to the excitement brought about. And though his role was brief, Charlton Heston was good as the caring man Henry Hooker, even if his exterior was somewhat rough. I did like the color and the movie set Old Tuscon as well.

It's essentially just a well made, but derivative melodrama with some of the old BDSM thrown in to spice things up.I have to admit I didn't notice much different with the change of directors. It does seem to follow on fairly logically from the first film, but if you're stepping in for the first time, you shouldn't have too many problems picking up the gist of things. I'd never try to argue the storyline is all that deep.Dakota Johnson makes the film for me. She is a very appealing Ana and carries off the the vulnerable/strong character thing really well. Unlike some of the other reviewers around these parts, I think she succeeds in displaying plenty of chemistry with Christian. And speaking of that well-known male dominant, let me just add that I think Jamie Dornan plays that part quite well. Yes, he does appear kind of wooden and emotion-lite, but that's the way Christian is written in the books. And as many are aware, author EL James had a very big influence in the adaption of her books to the screen. For a start, her hubby Niall Leonard, is the sole script writer! All those expecting a vastly different screen persona of Christian are just whistling into a gale of a wind.It was fun seeing Kim Bassinger turn up playing Elena, considering she starred in Nine and a Half Weeks, back 30 years or so ago and that film kicked up the same sort of reaction from critics as 50 Shades etc. ( It was also a commercial hit.)

1341,2208619,2011-11-21,her_majesty_mirela,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (2011),5.0,"If you are a Twi-hard fan who has been satisfied with the movies so far, you will love it. However if you are someone like me who is a fan of the books but struggles to enjoy the movies, you will definitely still have those same issues. This movie sticks closest to the book. Most scenes follow the book very closely both script wise and visually. With the other movies certain things weren't always the way the book would describe them to be, but with ""Breaking Dawn 1"" they've definitely done well with sticking to the story. Bill Condon has done an excellent job directing and the score has finally gone back into Carter Burwell capable hands. So if you loved the score from the first movie, you'll get those tingles all over again as Bella's lullaby plays in the background of some of the best scenes. The soundtrack is OK, no songs by Muse this time around though which I found to be a shame since they're a great band and have contributed to the previous soundtracks. However, one of the favorites from the first movie makes a comeback to accompany a beautiful, if not the most beautiful scene in the entire movie. The wolves also look good, though I found them to look a little ""obviously fake"" in a couple of scenes, but it is definitely not something that will take away from the quality of the film. I expected better action scenes considering how much money these movies make. All the action scenes are night scenes so the shots are really dark and hard to make out. It's not like they needed to ""watch the budget"".

On that note, I will now share what I didn't like about the movie. My biggest issue is still the same one that I've had since I saw the first movie: Kristen Stewarts performance as Bella. I have always had a problem with the way she portrays this character but I had hoped that with this movie she would get better because it is full of some serious emotional stuff. She not only under delivers in this movie but she really takes the magic out of it. Her performance is stiff, wooden, emotionless and annoyingly bland. It's basically Kristen playing herself instead of the beautiful character of Bella Swan. The script has given her some fantastic lines and emotionally gut wrenching material which she simply didn't deliver. The only scenes that worked in her favor are in the second half of the movie and that's because of the fact that they did a great make up job and she lost enough weight to look convincingly sick throughout the pregnancy. I have seen Kristen Stewart in other movies too and I just think that this girl is a very weak actress. It's a real shame because Bella is a great character in the books. Pattinsons performance is extremely disappointing in this movie. I think that he is a good actor but his best performance was probably in the first movie. It's since gotten weaker and weaker. Although he's performance is not the strongest, he is still believable as Edward. The actor who has improved the most and gotten better in every installment is Taylor Lautner and that's pretty hard for me to admit because I thought that he wasn't a good choice for Jacob at the start. Out of the three main characters Taylor is the most convincing. So I have to give props to Taylor as he is the strongest link in this movie with Kristen being the weakest. I also do not understand why they keep changing certain Cullens members hair styles and hair colors from bad to worse in these movies. OK Alice's hair is definitely spot on in this installment and the closest to the way it's described in the book. Emmet's and Esme's is too. Carlisle's and Jasper's however is awful. They have orange hair and really bad hair dos. Edwards hair is terrible. I will never understand why they changed his look so drastically from the first movie. He looked the way Edward is described in the book in the first movie. The hair was perfect and they also plucked and tamed Roberts eyebrows in the first film giving him that ""out worldly beauty"" that Edward is supposed to have. In this movie he's eyebrows are about three inches thick and his hair style is not even close to the way Edwards hair is described. The worst hair award definitely goes to poor Nikki Reid who plays the most stunning girl in the Cullen family, the irresistibly beautiful blonde, Rosalie. OK, her hair is not even blonde in this part!!! Seriously? It's a disgusting shade of dark gray and that is really confusing because her hair looked great in the last film, Eclipse. She also got robbed material wise. She barely has two lines in the movie even though she's one of if not the most predominant supporting characters in the book. Real shame too because Nikki's a good actress and there is some great interaction between Rosalie and Jacob in the book that they've sadly left out of the movie.

I thought that the birth scene was well done considering that they had to take it down to PG13 standards. The last 10 minutes of the movie are amazing and set the bar very high for ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"". I have to give Bill Condon props for doing a great job directing. Definitely did the best job out of the directors, shame he wasn't on board from the beginning.

1343,1335671,2006-11-22,Jay_Exiomo,Happy Feet (2006),7.0,"After marching to stardom last year via the hit documentary ""March of the Penguins,"" the fat birds in tuxedo - or at least their pixelated versions - are back on the big screen with the Aussie film ""Happy Feet,"" joining this year's battalion of computer-animated features that rival Noah's ark for the number of animals included. But with such dazzling visual elements (oh yes, I'm in total awe), catchy songs and an earnest story, director George Miller's (""Babe: Pig in the City"") Antarctic adventure stand out from an otherwise overly saturated film genre that has had recently become a hit-or-miss affair.

""Happy Feet"" is built around the premise that each emperor penguin must have his own ""heartsong."" Taught from childhood, each penguin is expected to find within him/her the song essential to finding a lifelong mate and having children. Enter Mumble (younger one voiced by E.G. Daily, and older one voiced by Elijah Wood), a young emperor penguin who finds himself a stranger to his own kind because he can't sing, although he's unusually gifted in tap dancing. This, much to the dismay of his parents - Memphis (Hugh Jackman in his nth movie this year) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman).

Soon, fish supply in the south pole is dwindling and the penguins are starving. Noah (Hugo Weaving), an elder of the penguin colony, blames Mumble and his strange talents for the curse and exiles him. Convinced that ""alien"" beings are responsible for the food shortage, Mumble sets on a journey to have a diplomatic affair with them regarding their predicament. Along with him is a group of adelie penguins, their appointed leader Ramón (Robin Williams...) and a know-it-all spiritual teacher penguin, Lovelace (... and Robin Williams).

The animation is amazingly done with photo-realistic environments. Also, while the characters are not overall distinctive and memorable, it's compensated by their adorable nature (cute yet not all-too-cloying) and good voice performances. Robin Williams, in particular, steals every scene he's in - which is a lot, since he does two personalities here. It's clear he's having fun, and so are we.

Ah, but if only the film stayed on track. Towards the end, the scriptwriters decide to do an Al Gore and impart an environmental advocacy campaign, which is in itself a noble idea. But here, it feels as a misapplied digression and taking all merits into account, it's something that hedges the film from what it should achieve.

Still, in a time where the boundaries of animation has very much expanded to the point that it has become mostly tedious, ""Happy Feet"" manages to enchant the viewer not only through its breathtaking visuals, but also through its charming characters and the overall innocence of the film. It's right up near ""Cars"" (I haven't seen ""Flushed Away"" yet) and that's surely one thing to be happy about.",474,0,,0,No reference

1348,3876790,2018-11-30,Tweekums,Le tueur du lac (2017),8.0,"This French crime drama can be looked at as the second season of 'Vanished by the Lake'; protagonists, policewoman Detective Lise Stocker and her partner gendarme Clovis Bouvier have moved to Annecy; another lakeside location with their nine month old son. A series of murders provides the backdrop to the story; it appears that a serial killer is targeting women he meets online. As the investigation progresses it seems that the killer has access in inside knowledge and Lise suspects that Clovis is hiding something from her.Having enjoyed 'Vanished by the Lake' I had high hopes for this series; while I did enjoy it I don't think it was quite as good as the first. Barbara Schulz, who played Lise in 'Vanished' is replaced by Julie De Bona; this wasn't a problem though as she isn't too different and does a fine job in the role. The story provides some good mysteries; as well as the identity of the killer there is the question of the woman who appears to haunt Clovis' memories... the latter question is resolved sooner leaving the conclusion to the question of who the killer is and how they stay one step ahead of the investigators. As the end approaches there is still a variety of suspects and the identity of the killer is far from obvious... my guess was incorrect! The tension increased nicely to the point that by the end I was on the edge of my seat. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of 'Vanished'; even if it isn't quite as good it is pretty close.These comments are based on watching the series in French with English subtitles.",276,0,,0,No reference

It was a favored show.This ""EQUALIZER"", with Denzel Washington, is no retread, but a completely different take on a man who if you were the opposition, would never want to challenge.Many times it has been said this is like the good guy version of ""Training Day"". The only legitimate comparison is that gifted director Antoine Fuqua, was the director of each, and already had his main star's persona in his head, so 100% of Denzel's skills were on view.This movie is not formulaic. Perhaps some of you never met the Russian Mafia from the comfort of your 9-5 jobs, but they are every bit the savage, seemingly unconcerned with consequences personalities, that would affect any human, not a sociopath without conscience or sense of morality.Fuqua uses diametric opposites in order to sharpen this INTENSE, as accurate a word as I can muster, for this movie, which makes no compromises.You have Denzel Washington's character, never fully explained, but clearly a former special forces commando. I go with NSA over Delta Force or Seals, as he shows a calculating non-remorse for the job he has taken on, avenging the beating of a Russian Prostitute who was left for dead, and to whom he had a common late night eatery as a bonding point.Like Clark Kent, by day , McCall is an everyday ""Home Mart"" employee, well-liked for his hard work and concern for his fellow employees. But, like Bruce Wayne, when the former commando emerges, he takes no prisoners, leaves no walking wounded. Still, unlike any other action movie, his deeds all seem credible and believable.In the end his fellow workers see the real Robert McCall, at the edge of your seat conclusion , the last 15 minutes of what turns out in the end, to be an epic movie in scope. He literally goes to the head of the snake after an unforgettable duel in the Home Mart, which might as well be the main street in any Western.Always true to his sense of JUSTICE, good is good, bad is trash to be taken out, we are treated to a new genre sub-category, the super action film, an ordinary man, capable of extraordinary acts.10 of ten for a can't miss winner, I guarantee you will like.",413,0,,0,No reference

The first thing I thought was that it must have been a very weak field, indeed. I love Jeff Bridges but you can see every bone in his body acting as he tries but fails to find the character or a great performance. Too obvious, insincere Kristofferson gravely voice. He has done better and for which he deserved an Oscar. Shame he got one for this, and I imagine he is more than a little sheepish, esp if he is the genuine actor I think he is and can still see through his ego.This movie has been made many times, and much, much better. Tender Mercies, Payday, A Star is Born, Rock Star (even the Kristofferson version is much, much better than this movie, and you get the real guy). Not to mention more recent fare, like Walk the Line and the James Brown biopic (I dare you to compare Juaquin Phoenix's Johnny Cash to Bridges here!). That is a list of movies to see and unlike this one, they are memorable in a way that makes you rewatch them. True Oscar worthy performances in many. There is not a creative bone anywhere in this movie. The writing and direction are phoned in. Character motivation is zip, esp for Maggie Gyllenhaal, which makes the relationship between them gross. No convincing motivation for anyone. Colin Farrell is the class of the cast in his small role as Bridges' old student now famous. In a *good* movie, Farrell wouldn't have stood out as much, as the bar would have been so much higher and Farrell's performance expected.Robert Duvall has a couple scenes (fitting, since this tries to be Tender Mercies II) and in one he manages to completely negate and dehumanize a Mexican immigrant. The truly sad thing and why I bring this up is that this scene is completely redundant and unnecessary. Duvall speaks Spanish to a guy he calls 'Jesus', who is pushing a mop pail across the floor. Duvall abruptly says, irritated, ""Someday I am going to teach you English!"". When Juan or Bridges (I forget and am NOT watching it again) points out that his name is really Juan, Duvall says, ""Juan, Jesus, whatever your name is, who cares?"" Juan is immediately turned into ""one of those"". The man is not important enough to be correctly named. Just ""one of THEM"", even though he is the only one left who is helping keep the bar open and has perhaps known Duvall a while. No, there was no appearance of Duvall being a spacey old coot, just mean-spirited and as if Juan was generic and replaceable, as many see immigrants. Duvall is powerful enough that he doesn't have to speak lines like that, but he did. I am just wondering how desperate Richard Gallegos was to do the role of Juan. They could have written any character into that role. Duvall's character's crusty old wife, a crusty old friend, his son, his best friend, and on and on. To be fair, the doctor who attends Bridges', earlier, seems to be Hispanic (they ARE in New Mexico and Arizona, after all) and that was a very good call. But that good diversity moment was negated with this unforgivable, stereotypical and insulting scene. But the director must take all responsibility for this nonsense, in the end. So he has written a terrible script (not just because of this, which seemed ad libbed, anyway) and directed a terrible movie, shot like a commercial, only slower. We never get a good look at some of the beautiful scenery the movie is shot in. I have lived in the southern New Mexico wasteland and was looking forward to that odd beauty, as well as driving into the gorgeous mountains as you go north, but the cinematographer doesn't allow us to settle our gaze upon the scenery.",664,0,,0,No reference

Asano's character seems to be a classic example of synaesthesia in action. This is sometimes associated with schizophrenia, but I've also heard it mentioned by parents of autistic children. Who knows what goes on in the mind of Christopher Doyle? Maaybe not even Chris Doyle after a night on the grog.I'm guessing as usual, but I think the English/Aussie bar owner is playing the Doyle role, reborn every day with a slight hangover and a few fresh bruises, and attempting to show that language is just one of the barriers that humans have to negotiate in order to communicate effectively. If you can't get over it, you can always go around it. Or invent an image based filmic language for the global village. Visually, this movie plays like a roadkill version of Fallen Angels, fractured and displaced almost at random. The soundtrack is as non-linear as the rest of the movie, crashing around like a breakbeat electro dj on dodgy pills. It makes the MTV jumpcut junkies look positively pedestrian when it takes flight, but still manages to explore the rapport between the three principals in a tender, almost polite fashion. It makes very little immediate sense, what with the language and obtuse script, but the gentle absurdity gels quite nicely upstairs in the aftermath.I doubt that it would be possible to write a spoiler for this movie, because it's unlikely that any two people would ever see it quite the same way.

Ping-Pong is what we play; one, two or three matches before going upstairs again to see the next film. We had two more movies; one chosen by me, the other by Gian. We watched Gian's choice because we had already watched a film I'd chosen.The thing with ""Croupier"" is rather strange. Don't ask me why I felt weird when it started, like I didn't trust the movie. There were many parts that should have been exciting but they weren't quite exciting to me. I tried to like those parts, but it became very difficult.From the outside it is a well done film, I mean; directed by a respected British filmmaker (Mike Hodges), an interesting plot, an attractive main character and among other films, poker. I haven't seen lots of poker pictures, but before ""Croupier"" I had seen some very good showings of this thrilling card game; for instance, ""Rounders"" and more recently ""Shade"".Comparing Mike Hodges' film with the latter ones would only be useful in terms of how the movies deal with the game. Then, the three of them contain totally different characters in different realities, living different stories involving different situations. In ""Rounders"" we could meet two friends willing to get to a professional poker career. In ""Shade"" we experienced the lives of different people consumed by the game and its difficulties. However, in ""Croupier"", there's just one character, and that could be one of the movie's problems. We see everything in Jack's (Clive Owen) life as a croupier, writer, gambler or whatever, and what I think is that the film gets so centered in him that it becomes boring.In the pages of what's close to a screenplay owner of contradictions, Jack walks along in his different facets and Paul Mayersberg forgets about the rest of the people involved in his tale. The contradictions I'm talking about is that the script can even follow the only character it cares about with some sense. It presents the main character's narration that at moments gets confused with the rest of the story, generating big time lines problems.Although it gets tedious, Clive Owen's narration is good, as his performance. At this film's time he had already had some Hollywood experiences, but in a movie from his own country, he was already proving the gifted actor he was.

Movies are, at their best, visual stories wherein dialogue and logic are secondary players to what is being expressed...by what is SHOWN. Shyamalan may be the most pompous big-name director in Hollywood history. He has (or at least pretends to have) an insanely bloated sense of artistic worth (see his character in this movie) and is a lousy actor; he certainly needs to hire a writer to better flesh out his films' thin thin thin premises. But, to me there's no getting around the fact that he brings home the goods when it comes to creating stunning and affecting visuals and coaxing powerfully emotional performances from his actors. You can complain all day (or until you are self-satisfied) about ludicrous plots, stilted dialogue, narcissism, etc. etc. The fact remains that M. Night can scare pants off with the best of 'em. His technique and performers pull the meat over even the barest-boned plots, and his films feel like a full meal built out of a table scraps. I just don't get a feeling as eerily singular from any other modern flickmaker.",190,0,,0,No reference

1369,2282579,2012-04-28,paul_haakonsen,Dead Heat (1988),4.0,"If you like cheesy movies from the late 1980's, then ""Dead Heat"" might be something for you. This movie is full of bad jokes, a stupid storyline and awful one-liners. But hey, there is an audience for everything out there, isn't there?When I picked up this movie, I was expecting more of a zombie comedy, but it turned out to be more of a cop story with a hint of zombies in it. Someone is using a machine to bring back the dead, and detectives Roger Mortis (played by Treat Williams) - spoof off Rigor Mortis? - and Doug Bigelow (played by Joe Piscopo) are on the case.The movie itself is not all that bad, actually, I had just expected somewhat more of a laugh-out-loud comedy. However, if you are watching this for the zombies, then you will be sorely disappointed. Not much to come here after in that department. There was a couple of minutes worth of zombie effects and hilarious effects, and that was about it.Having seen it now, I can honestly say that I will not be watching it again. This is the type of movie that you watch once (if you didn't watch it back in 1988), then bag and tag it, putting it on the shelf and letting it stand there as a DVD collection filler.",221,0,,0,No reference
1370,3977307,2019-01-25,tabuno,Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003),6.0,"22 November 2003. Perhaps it is with Charlie Chaplin and the silent movies or perhaps its the 1950s romantic comedies, but the cartoons of yesterday come alive today with this back to action of famous animated characters in a dazzling array of vignettes and live-animated combinations. The best part about this picture is the animated characters but perhaps that relative. The old cliche of overt singular violence that isn't high tech may be over children's heads nowadays.The science fiction motif was great for sci fi fans, but misses with most of the audience. Kevin McCarthy in black and white from the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) was a great cameo. The worst dead weight in the movie appears to be Steve Martin and some of Jenna Elfman's stilted acting - and there are moments when the live characters really seem to be by themselves acting without their animated buddies.Overall, this is an enjoyable, sometimes hilarious comedy - it continues the punch lines of old with updates and has enough action and entertainment to gloss over the slow parts, particularly the poor human actors. Brendan Fraser is solid with his comedy action routine and Joan Cusack is delicious as always. There were a number of genius flashes of great animation recalling the classic cartoons while there were a number of dull, tedious human acting scenes. Alot better than Airplane and dumb comedy, this intelligent, witty full-length feature has a lot going for it but it never reaches its full potential. Six out of Ten Stars.",256,0,,0,No reference
1371,1690958,2008-08-28,DICK STEEL,Sharasôju (2003),8.0,"First and foremost, I thought the camera took on a life of its own, and drew a lot of attention to itself. It's free-wheeling, panning, tracking and zooming into noises that call out for notice. In some sense, it took on voyeuristic elements as it seemed we're right there with the characters and witnessing incidents as they unfold in the movie at first person's perspective. Not only that, Kawase has a penchant of incredibly long takes, not slow moving all the time though, but having scenes reveal themselves in one continuous shot. I would've imagined the nightmare during production should someone mess up, and the need to start over. Shots following characters also seem to be favourites, where it felt like we had to perpetually chase after the characters to follow on every plot development.The story's nothing to shout about, as it looks at the lives of a household in Nara, Japan, after a member of the family mysteriously disappears, leaving behind mom Reiko (Naomi Kawase), dad Taku (Katsuhisa Namase) and their son Shun (Kohei Fukungaga). The opening shot's quite peculiar as well, as a slow moving camera rotates about in a room, as we hear continuous background chimes from the neighbourhood temple, with the voices of Shun and brother Kei conversing, and finally seeing them through window reflections, before a game of ""follow me"" turns into mystery, one which never gets resolved conclusively in the movie, unless you deem that the eyes from which we watch the movie, is from the eyes and perspective of Kei's.Kei's disappearance is classic X-Files, just as how Fox Mulder had to deal with Samantha's own, and here we follow the family and how they each dealt with this - as one of the unseen characters puts it - case of ""spirited away"". Taku immerses himself in organizing the annual Basara street festival as its chairperson, while mom Reiko cultivates green fingers. Shun, blaming himself for losing sight of his brother, exorcises his demons through painting, and from the care given by girlfriend and neighbour Yu (Yuka Hyyoudo), who turns out to be living with her aunt. Even then, the theme of loss doesn't get forgotten, in another long talkie scene where Yu learns of how she came to live in a foster home under the guardianship of her aunt, in a rather incestuous tale that sounded a wee bit incredible, though surprisingly moving.All's not doom and gloom though in Shara, in case you're wondering if this movie's slow pace would be your cup of tea, or whether you'll feel down after watching a sad movie. The movie ends off with a rather uplifting note of hope, where the anticipated birth of a child with a fine penis (yes, it was from the movie, OK?) lies in stark contrast with the mysterious loss of one in the beginning. In fact, things start to pick up (in pace even) after the Basara street festival scene, where before the narrative dealt with the mulling over Kei, and had generous allowance to set up all the principal characters.And what a spectacle the Basara street performance was! Though it was highly repetitive, you can't deny the exuberant energy that the camera captured from the performers, entertaining all in a mesmerizing dance on the streets, which turned into a wet rain dance sequence under heavy downpour. If any scene would've stuck in your mind after you leave the theatre, this would be it, with a little wry scene where Shun had in his crowd control duties, inadvertently blocked the view of a cute knee-high tall child with his palm.Shara turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable, and I now look forward to the documentary by Tetsuaki Matsue titled Summer Vacation with Naomi Kawase.",623,0,,0,No reference

1373,873252,2004-12-26,Rich B,Finding Forrester (2000),10.0,"I'd heard a little about this movie before and entered into watching it merely expecting to see another of Sean Connery's typical Connery performances. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that, he is a very good actor, but he always plays himself. Other than that, I had no inclination what the story was about so there was surprise from the outset seeing that the movie was starring Busta Rhymes and was set in the Bronx.How surprised I was as this gentle and perfectly paced tale brings together two people who share a common love for writing, one is a faded writer who once had success, and the other is a new talent who faces so many obstacles in his path to let his talent shine.There are similarities to other films such as Dead Poets Society, but what captures the viewer and their imagination is the restraint and the simplicity. There are no great acts or contrived emotionally charged plot twists, this is real and it's character driven. You believe in the characters, the acting is so natural and understated you are easily drawn into the movie and the characters lives, and it's hard to break free. Choices and actions are small, compassionate, and you can relate them to real life.The relationship between Forrester (Connery) and Jamal (Rob Brown) is superbly played with Brown holding back perfectly until the scene where his restraint fails, and Connery giving one of the most emotive and complex performances I have ever seen. His performance is simply stunning and totally off of the Connery mould. Watching his face as he struggles with demons long past was extraordinary.Overall the story is very well written, and doesn't fail to pull you along with the emotional journey and yet never hit the twee button. You can feel the passion that Connery has for writing, and see the complexity of emotions as he wants to help the boy but gets pulled back by hidden problems. Problems which slowly reveal themselves and get shared and dealt with in the most natural of ways, again never falling foul of an emotion overload.It's warm, uplifting and an inspiring story and I recommend it to anyone. I really can't be vocal enough about the stunning performance by Connery, and the matching performance by Brown. Even Rhymes shows that he has talent.",390,0,,0,No reference
1374,308986,2001-07-17,quatloos,True Confessions (1981),,"It is interesting that many people around the world enjoyed this gem despite not having been raised in Los Angeles, California. Like ""Chinatown,"" ""Mulholland Falls,"" ""L.A. Confidential,"" and others, this film is in small part a celebration of the sleazy underside of pre-1960 L.A. Its story contains references to numerous geographic and historical icons from that era, and weaves in oblique references to everything from the infamous ""Black Dahlia"" murder to the legacy of the first wave of Irish immigrants to L.A. to the genesis of the pornographic movie industry which eventually made its headquarters in nearby Northridge, California. Extreme attention to historical detail is obvious in every scene. Robert DeNiro, at his understated best, plays a priest who manifests the power politics that the Catholic Chuch has often engaged in out of political and economic necessity. Robert Duvall, as DeNiro's brother, plays a lonely burned out LAPD homicide detective with a perpetually wistful expression that suggests horrors and heartbreak stolidly borne. Ultimately this is a story about the love between two brothers who could never connect but never lost touch with one another. Despite its glossy photography, this is not a blockbuster but a chamber piece. The ending is, for once, a tear jerker for men. Extremely erudite scriptwriting with top notch production values. This is as close to flawless as ""Chinatown"" was. I recommend it most highly!",229,0,,0,No reference

The older cast of star wars is unable to act any other way. In this edition, at least their roles called for it a bit more. I wasn't expecting a joyful meeting among old friends here in episode 8 as I was in episode 7. They played their parts a bit better. The action produced wasn't as intense at the beginning of the movie as compared with most of the OTHER Star Wars films, so it definitely felt slower moving than we're used to. However, some of thew most entertaining ideas that star wars has seen to date were employed. From floating in space without a suit to escape death, to literally teleportation across the galaxy using only the force.... The movie really inspired some age old ideas in new ways, and it turned out fairly well in my opinion. Anyways, I feel like it was a good watch, and I wasn't disappointed.

1381,5484292,2020-12-17,bowmanblue,The Terror Within (1989),6.0,"I'm quite partial to cheesy sci-fi B-movies. I don't expect too much and am quite happy with a rubbery monster, chomping his way through a cast of unknowns. To be fair, I got all that with 1989's 'The Terror Within,' but, just because it was cheesy, didn't really mean it was that good.Earth has succumbed to some sort of plague (don't dwell on it too much - it's just an excuse for the remaining humans to live underground) and those who have survived now dwell in a bunker while mutated monsters (known as 'gargoyles' roam the land).George Kennedy is about the only cast member you may have seen before. And he leads the rag-tag bunch of survivors as they try and stay alive when one of the dastardly gargoyles finds its way down below.The creature got in about a third of the way into the film and, up until that point, I was quite happily enjoying the story (despite its lack of originality). However, no sooner did the monster make its appearance, did the film show itself for what it was - a shameless rip-off of 'Alien.'Now, I've seen plenty of 'Alien' clones, none of which lived up to the 1979 classic, but many that were entertaining in their own way. However, this one just comes across as a bit on the cheap side. 'Alien' was dark and claustrophobic with a truly memorable xenomorph that had never been seen before on screen. The monster in 'The Terror Within' is truly laughable. It's just a (fat?) man in a rubber costume. It really isn't scary at all and is quite cringeworthy.The characters are pretty one dimensional and make every classic horror movie mistake when dealing with something that's trying to kill them. They split up often and run into dangerous situations without really thinking things through.Overall, if you like cheap rip-offs of 'Alien,' then there are plenty out there that are better than this. There isn't much in the way of gore, but if there was a 'high-point' it was the 'birthing' scene of the creature - it may be a complete rip-off of John Hurt's classic scene in 'Alien,' but at least it was suitably gory and even made me a bit squeamish.",373,0,,0,No reference

Moments after the verdict, someone fishes out part of Melissa Rowe from water.....but it's too late....or is it?

Since the cameras focused a couple of times on an older man in the audience at the trial, I just hoped I wasn't going to see another predictable father-takes-revenge-on-his-own sidebar here but he did something but not what I presumed.

Quick investigative work (impossibly quick!) discovers that Mr. Rowe is a White Supremist which explains why he murdered his wife (she was half-black and he didn't know it until after the marriage) and the theory is that he also might have killed someone first. Someone else is being blamed for that murder but Horatio is hoping to get Rowe on that charge since double jeopardy applies and they can't try him again on his wife's murder.

1384,1882150,2009-11-12,bragant,Rope (1948),9.0,"Hitchcock once said that his movies, ""went from being failures to being masterpieces without ever being successful."" Perhaps none of his films deserves this description more than ROPE, made in 1948 as the first project for Hitchcock's own (short-lived) production company, Transatlantic Pictures. On its initial release, ROPE was received with overwhelming hostility, either derided as nothing more than a stunt and a gimmick, or actually banned outright in parts of the USA, the UK and Europe due to its exceptionally disturbing subject matter, of which ""homosexuality"" is the least important. Of course, it was a box-office failure. As a result, ROPE was removed from circulation for 25 years after its release by Hitchcock himself (who personally owned the rights), and only became available for viewing in 1983 a few years after the director's death. It was unavailable on video until the 1990s, and as a result gained something of a reputation as a ""lost"" film. Only now is ROPE getting the recognition it deserves, and its presence on the IMDb ""Top 250"" list is one of many indicators that ROPE's time has finally arrived. I will not comment on the film's extraordinary technique or on the homosexual innuendo, as so many others have already done so. Instead, I wish to discuss only the film's themes. Set entirely within a luxurious Manhattan apartment, ROPE depicts the downfall of Brandon (John Dall) and Philip (Farley Granger), a pair of thrill-killers who murder their school chum David (Dick Hogan) because they believe that they are ""superior"" beings who have the right to decide who will live or die. Unlike any other Hitchcock film, the murder occurs within the first 60 seconds, and we spend the remaining 74 minutes of the movie wondering whether and how the killers will be caught. In an act of supreme arrogance, Brandon and Philip have planned the murder to coincide with a party which will be attended by the victim's father, aunt and fiancée, among others, and even go so far as to serve a buffet-style dinner on top of the very chest containing David's dead body. ROPE is one of Hitchcock's most disturbing films because it implicates the audience in the murder and then forces us to side with the killers - bizarrely, we do not want them to be caught and most of the film's extreme tension and suspense result from this psychological dilemma. You will be on the edge of your seat during one scene where the camera just sits there while the housekeeper clears away the dinner remains off of the chest - you just KNOW she is going to open it, and you actually breathe a sigh of relief when she is stopped at the last moment! Furthermore, ROPE operates at some level as a critique of upper-class manners and morals (or the lack thereof) - Brandon and Philip seem to be exemplary members of the US upper crust. One of the party guests - Rupert Cadell (a badly miscast Jimmy Stewart, in a role which was refused by a number of stars beforehand) - eventually begins to suspect something strange, but even he cannot bring himself to believe that his former students have actually done what he fears, because David Kentley's death becomes his fault. Rupert Cadell is a type easily recognizable to anyone who has experienced the hell of graduate school in an elite Northeastern university - gifted, but glib, facile, and espousing fashionably nihilistic theories based on complete contempt for the entire human race as a means of amusing others, inflating one's personal reputation as an ""original thinker"" and rising on the social ladder. Isolated in his ivory tower, Rupert seems completely oblivious to the truth that ideas have consequences. Like the 1990s American PSYCHO, ROPE raises some serious questions about the morality of the American elite - these are not ghetto gang-bangers, but the best and the brightest. Just a few months ago in the real world, a handsome, educated young medical student became known as the ""Craigslist Killer"" due to his slaughter of a masseuse he met online. The newsmedia were full of pundits who were shocked beyond belief that an attractive youth from a ""good"" background could in fact be nothing more than a callous killer. This kind of thinking equates an attractive appearance and a moneyed background with moral rightness. ROPE is a masterful critique of this brainless American mindset in which reality and appearance are one. America seems to be suffering these days from an epidemic of arrogance in which money and power are believed to be the same as virtue and decency. In ROPE, Brandon never questions for a single second either his own presumed ""superiority,"" or the notion that this putative superiority gives him the power of life and death. Even more importantly, Brandon kills to please an authority figure, Rupert, who until the night of David Kentley's party, professes fashionable nihilism and misanthropy as a ""philosophy of life."" ROPE is a powerful critique of all those who believe that their membership in any elite group gives them the right to decide who will live and who will die. It becomes more thought-provoking and disturbing with each viewing. I have been to parties in New York where the conversation has revolved around such subjects as the astrological signs of movie stars, and every time I watch ROPE, it makes me look at those around me in a new and disturbing light. This is why I think ROPE is actually the most frightening film Hitchcock ever made - its world is so recognizably our own.",932,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

Either on the bad levels or the good ones (if you should find some), since most fans are so divided on this third entry.  It falls somewhere under fair for me, as the effects continue to be awesome, but the story this time is tremendously lacking.  Part two had three villians equally as strong as Superman, plus the romance going with Lois Lane.  This one has a Lex Luthor clone (Hackman's Lex is left off-screen in jail) who also would like to rule the world, a dweeby computer genius (Pryor, as the much debated addition to the cast) and a romance you know will go nowhere with one of Reeve's lost loves.  We already saw that he couldn't give things up for Lois, so why bother brining on a new girl? Though O' Toole is gorgeous, a lot more than Kidder, who is featured at the beginning of the film looking aged, then at the end with a bad tan.  Rumor has it she outpriced herself which resulted in the character being shipped off to Bermuda.  With her out of the picture, Reeve attends a high school reunion where he bumps into O'Toole.  Meantime, Vaughn and Pryor are poised for world dominance, though Pryor is realizing the ramifications and is reluctant.  But he still goes through it, concocting a kryptonite like impairment for Superman, which results in some of the film's best scenes. Reeve develops a naughty alter ego, and we get to see Superbad-man get drunk, straighten the Tower of Pisa, even get horny,  among other things. There's a terrific showdown between Reeve and...well, Reeve in a junkyard where bad Supes confronts his inner goodness, Clark Kent.  After this, though, the film sags to it's conclusion, as Reeve goes up against more rockets and missiles, a la part one.  Despite missing the tension of part two, the film is interesting in a disjointed kind of way.  The flying effects are once again top-notch, and strangely enough, are better than in the next film which came out four years later!  And most have mentioned the dopey opening sequence that belonged more in a silent comedy than here, but it wasn't a horrendous mistake.  I must note as a kid that when Vaughn's sister is turned into that psycho-robot it FREAKED me out!  Biggest annoyance is the kid who plays Ricky, his voice is badly dubbed and incredibly nerve-racking.  Also could've done without O'Herlihy's drunken antagonist.  Most of the music is lifted from part two, but since I liked Ken Thorne's work, I didn't mind.  I could even say (Supe fans will kill me) I would rather watch this one than the first movie.  So even though the story isn't really there like in the previous films, the movie overall still FLIES (hehe).",470,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

From 1949-1950, the Master of Suspense took a temporary break from Hollywood film-making and produced two UK productions, the first being 'Under Capricorn (1949),' a fascinating but relatively unengaging melodrama with superb camera-work. The second, a return to his standard narrative form after two noticeably experimental pictures, was an adaptation of the story ""Man Running"" by Selwyn Jepson. With a wonderful British supporting cast, centred around Hollywood stars Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich, the film has a distinctly British feel to it, and not just because of the actors and setting. Hitchcock's whimsical sense of humour, evident in a great many of his pictures, is allowed to permeate the traditional drama/romance storyline, and the film would certainly have felt comfortable alongside the Ealing comedies of the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of which employed darkly comedic overtones.There's something about Jane Wyman that immediately caught my eye while watching this film. Behind her rosy cheeks, timid eyes and soft voice, there's a certain innocence and vulnerability about her demeanour that really drew my sympathy. Her character, Eve Gill, is basically a petty schoolgirl, driven by silly but unwavering aspirations to uncover the truth, and her delicate personality is punctuated by moments of stubbornness, and, indeed, some occasional bravery. I've never really taken to actress Marlene Dietrich, and I find her distinct European accent and stunted line-delivery to be rather distracting; however, she does passably well as Charlotte Inwood, demonstrating an arrogant disposition that forms a strong contrast with the mild personality of Wyman's character. As far as the male actors are concerned, strong performances are given by Richard Todd as the wrongly-accused boyfriend {for some reason or another, the Irish actor reminded me of Joaquin Phoenix}, Michael Wilding as the honest and romantic detective with whom Eve inevitably falls in love, and Alastair Sim is a lot of fun as our leading lady's loving and playful father.In comparing Alfred Hitchcock's films with those of his contemporaries, it's interesting to note how the director made stunning, dynamic use of the camera. Both 'Rope (1948)' and 'Under Capricorn (1949)' had made pioneering use of long-takes, sweeping the camera across the room with astonishing style and grace. For the first time, Hitchcock {and cinematographer Wilkie Cooper} integrated these techniques into a more traditional film-making style, and multiple sequences play out in a single take; my favourite shot follows Cooper (Richard Todd) through Charlotte's front door, and smoothly rises with him as he ascends the staircase. Another interesting element to the film, which met with much criticism upon its release, is the ingenious use of a false flashback, as Cooper's recount of past events is revealed to be little more than an elaborate lie. As the anecdote was explicitly treated as Cooper's own version of events, I see little ""dishonesty"" in Hitchcock's clever manipulation of the audience, and the final twist certainly succeeded in taking me by surprise  though I probably should have noticed something amiss when the romance between Eve and Smith began to develop.",524,0,,0,No reference

I must say that the character of Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow was the best villain I have ever seen in cinematic history. Cillian Murphy was absolutely brilliant portraying this psychotic, fear-obsessed villain. I am not a big fan of Katie Holmes, but she did a decent job in this movie.

And this one doesn't really disappoint at all, especially interesting regarding horror sequels mostly being pretty poor.This movie lacked a bit of that initial suspense and build up you had in the first, but because we obviously already know whats up, it knows not the follow the same footsteps and really plays around with the living chucky right from the start.It makes up for that suspense not with kills, but with comedy. Mostly vulgar comedy, with the always fantastic voice acting for chucky most of the lines are funny and quotable. It doesn't have a lot of kills as a slasher, but some of them are creative like the doll eye-assembly machine, and sewing machine.Chucky is shown way more on screen than the first movie, and the puppeteering is just amazing, it's well done and it being a real doll just so much more engaging. In general though, I feel like they could've played around with him a bit more. Mostly he's either on screen, or off. I'd love to see him in the background sneaking around to add a bit more suspense. Most of the ways chucky shows up is through a jumpscare.Andy's foster sister Kyle is great as well. Although her tough attitude changed pretty quickly and they kinda do away with it after a few scenes.Now the final scene, its like some screwed up willy wonka factory. Such fantastic set design. It completely engrossed me in the movie. All the scenes there, fantastic especially when chucky wakes up with molten plastic on him, definitely a scary sight if you watched this back in the day as a kid. Now that I think about that the practical effects are also outstanding, especially memorable is the scene where chucky has to pull off his hand.The movie ends with chucky exploding and the two, Andy and Kyle walking out of the factory... to me it was a little bit abrupt, as I expected one more final scene of where they'd end up. But it's not that big of a deal because it leaves some freedom for the next movie. And there's probably the main issue, there is little character development besides Chucky finding out he can't escape his doll form anymore.All in all very enjoyable and definitely something I wouldn't skip watching again.7/10",404,0,,0,No reference

Almost funny the first time, but it becomes a stale joke.The film description I saw beforehand spoke of the two main characters having a near-death experience. That term, to me, means, in part, out-of-body experience due to clinical death.Instead, this part of the film was a dangerous situation they escaped from while fully conscious and never clinically dead.I realize the film was made in only 22 days or such with a small cast and crew, little money, etc., but if meeting these challenges was some kind of test, I am afraid the film largely does not meet the challenge.A valiant try, but still amateurish.Milwaukee-area people will enjoy recognizing landmarks seen in the film.Note: For me, scoring a film at 5/10 means it is an average film.

Beautiful! I do not know who coached Lively in her very stylish performance, but it was such a joy to watch. The New Years lunch with her daughter Flemming was done absolutely awesome. Although the age of mother and daughter was reversed, it was absolutely stunning to watch Lively rocking a classic, perfectly groomed look that wouldn't have been so out of place in the 1930s, mothering over her daughter, almost admonishing her how to hold her cutlery properly ... amazing, stunning and absolute perfection.

After more than a year I haven't found a single person claiming that this was any good. This movie is so bad that the only people who dares to post good comment are the Producer (Eduardo Correa) and the Director (Benjamin Lopez a.k.a.""estudiob"")and that's cheating!! This is what happened when you mix a bad director, bad script, and very bad amateur actors (I take that back! they can't be called ""actors""! my apologies to the real hard working actors).

The only good thing about this disaster was the photography, it was fairly good, and the same can be said about the voice sound. But that's it, the rest is unwatchable. The plot is so, so, ridicule, and let me explain to those not from Puerto Rico, this is a 100 x 35 miles island, the simple idea that you can hide and ancient Taino tribe for 500 years is more than ridicule.

But even a ridicule plot can be saved with a good story and excellent performances; Well that's not the case here: first those cheesy dialogs were a torture for the ears, the acting was pathetic and amateur (they put no effort to get REAL ACTORS!), in the so called ""dramatic moments"" they used ""cheesy-80'slike-B-movie-sound effect"", and the director has no concept of visual story telling and sense of drama, the whole movie was an stereotypical homage of bad 80's adventure B-movies (just there's nothing exiting in this so called ""adventure movie"").

This is the kind o movie responsible for the bad reputation of puertorrican cinema. Many puertorricans want to see good movies done at the island; unfortunately most of the times this is what they get and in disappointment the public no longer support their very few local productions, because now ""Made in Puerto Rico"" means ""It's a bad movie"".",317,0,,0,No reference

I was hoping it would get funnier or turn out better as it went on but what was needed here was a more subtle, sophisticated hand, someone with something resembling a 'Lubitsch touch'. The result was a ham-handed comedy which was too obvious as far as innuendo and plot development are concerned.The cast did their considerable best, with Edward Everett Horton in one of his patented dithering simpleton roles carrying most of the comedic load, and aided and abetted by Adolph Menjou and Mary Astor. But by and large, the picture belonged to Genevieve Tobin, director Keighley's wife.

Yeah...it's that good.I went to see The Dark Knight Returns assuming that nothing can beat the last Dark Knight but somewhere down my heart,i was anticipating my utter failure again(to my pleasure). It turned out to be true. This picture truly is the humble reminder of living greatness in the form of Christopher Nolan. Either you can live a lifetime of a scholar by reading thousands of books or you can live a lifetime watching or i should rather say experiencing greatness.One thing which i can't cease to notice is that how grotesque the scenes of the collapse of Gotham were and how brilliantly he managed to encapsulate the desolated spirit of the people of the city. Some visuals were breathtaking and nerve chilling. To be honest,you truly start feeling somewhere in the middle of the movie that the Dark Knight won't rise. Since i haven't read the graphic novel so i thought so,but the part where he comes out of the well is one hell of a scene! There are moments,where you can just marvel at the genius of the director and this movie will provide you hundreds of such moments.I thought it would have its share of dull moments as its a long movie but i was proved wrong again.As fantastic as Nolan's concept itself is, The Dark Knight Returns truly belongs to the actors performing the difficult task of playing protagonists within the tragedy. Their individual talents, as well as diverse personalities, shine through to make the story poignant and the emotions so real that I found myself in awe in one instant, only to replace the admiration with shock in the next.Photography was brilliant especially when the city came under siege during the football match.Finally the bottom line is you just cannot judge greatness.A piece of art is called great not just due to the recognition it gets at its profane stage but finally when it is measured in its totality,when its message outshines the concoctions which made that piece invaluable.The Dark Knight Returns is one such movie. Christopher Nolan is a revolutionary and i can say with pride in my eyes that i lived in an era,which had people like Nolan who were instrumental in giving us such blaze of glory that we forget that the world in which we live has a Batman in real or just in books! 10 on 10.",428,0,,0,No reference

When it recently showed up on TCM, all that I could remember was the title, that I had a crush on the little Jewish girl, and some vague feeling of sadness, so when I watched it this time, I spent the first half worrying about the mouse and the second half worrying about the girl. Suffice to say that, regardless of what I may have felt 50 years ago, ""Hand in Hand"" is not a sad film, but rather a poignant fable about childhood bonding. The two child actors are excellent as is the direction and the supporting adult cast. The movie is beautifully scored as well, with a lovely central theme contrasting to the 'playful' music that often accompanies the children. The film's message is clear as the Michael and Rachel transcend their differing backgrounds, which at the end, are shown to not be fundamentally at odds anyway. There is not a mean-spirited moment in the film. The 'background of prejudice' is subtly established with the occasional offhand comment by an adult and the 'bigotry' that sets up the 'second' act comes from another child, who seems to be speaking more for society (""my father says"") than for himself. Interestingly, the film was originally called ""The Star and the Cross"", whatever the reason for the name change, it was either fortunate or inspired: ""Hand in Hand"" is a much better title, as the film is more about the two children's friendship than their respective faiths.",263,0,,0,No reference

I am not a racist, and I believe that a movie transcends race, religion, and culture. It is a work that brings together the elements of human nature and human ingenuity, both the best and the worst, into film, to weave a story that has a meaning and a reason, that gives us clues to how to live a better life. This is what a movie means to me.With that said, I must state here that the recent movies that I have seen these few years were, to say the least, disappointing. Dorm, is better than them. Period. The best movie I have seen still remains to be Donnie Darko, but Dorm comes very close. Very close. You can put it up there with Stand By Me and The Sixth Sense. The movie touched me in so many levels that after the movie, I started talking to myself about life and beyond. I know what you are thinking by now.

It doesn't make you jump. It doesn't make your hair stand on ends. No, this is not that kind of movies. As some reviewers already stated, this is a coming of age movie, one where the character learns about himself and grows. This is a supernatural movie about ghosts and friendships, about sacrifice and childhood, about a father's sin and a son's journey into becoming a man, a better man. I gave this movie ten points, so the first two points go to the story. This is a tried and tested method. A linear and chronological story that has no branches, no what-ifs, and no shocking endings. Hence, no screw-ups. The story was coherent, and the plots were all properly placed (albeit a bit flat), and the characters well-developed. The climax was justified, and the story was properly wrapped up before closing. This movie doesn't give you nonsense like a kid transferring to a new school and then bumps into a ghost for no good reasons. No, the father had an affair with the maid, the son saw it, and was shipped to a boarding school to keep the secret safe. The son suffers for the father's sin. As we later found out, this was not the case. The father in fact did it for the good of his son, but being a child, it wasn't easy for him to come to terms with the fact that the father was doing what was best for him. Dealing with domestic issues in a supernatural thriller is uncommon, but effective here as the father later deals with his adultery with his son. I used to be a school teacher myself, and the scene that grips me most was the headmistress seeing one of her own child drown at the bottom of the pool. I believe one could go crazy from a tragic accident like that. The Boy Who Cries Wolf was illustrated perfectly here in the movie, so kids, take heed. The best thing that I like the most, is that in this movie, the ghost is not a vicious, nasty, ugly, blood-thirsty, flesh-hungry, brain-dead, decomposing slab of meat that goes around haunting people for no good reasons. Why did Sadako do it? Why don't we ask how she did it with a tape? In this movie, the ghost is a little boy who had an unfortunate accident, who lives on to suffer the consequences of his own actions. Although his character was not very well developed, and you can practically tell he is the ghost 30-minutes into the movie, you won't actually mind at all. You will sympathize for him. You will feel for him. You will love him as if he is your son. And it was this friendship, a kid making his first friend in a new school (who happens to be a ghost), is what struck me the most. We remember all too well that first day in that new school, and that first person who came to talk to you who eventually became your best friend. Their friendship goes to such a level that a mere child was willing to risk his life to save the soul of not one, but two persons. One of the dead and one of the living. The story did not do the smart thing (like the ghost took over the boy's body as with we have seen in The Skeleton Key) or leaving the story wide open for a sequel. No, the boy saved the ghost, but therein lies the dilemma. Not only did he has to put his own life on the line, he also had to let the ghost leave. And then he told the headmistress the truth, and thanked her. The story didn't do the smart thing, but the right thing. And why did the ghost haunt the kid? Who asks the new kid to go to the toilet in the dead of the night? He was asking for it! Unfortunately, my lamenting has caused me to run out of words, so I'll be brief on the rest. The directing was good, except for the oversight on Ton's hair length. The music was superb, especially the ending song. The special effect was good, and the cinematography is brilliant on the use of colors and lighting. Lastly, the acting. One word: superb. Charlie is even better than Haley, hands down. The scene where he had his first meal with tears in his eyes, my heart bleed. I wish IMDb would give me more words, cause there are so much more I want to talk about this movie!",981,1,,1,Reference to other reviews
1414,959825,2005-05-24,TheNorthernMonkee,Blackadder II (1986),,"SPOILERS Three years after the release of a Tony Curtis and Rowan Atkinson comedy, the series returned. Relocated to a later period in time, Rowan Atkinson took a solid step back from the writing to be replaced by stand up comedian Ben Elton. With character personalities changed and the entire series turned on it's head, Curtis and Elton would work together to create the second, and finest, instalment in the lives of the family ""Blackadder"".

In Elizabethan England, Queen Elizabeth I (the divine Miranda Richardson) is overseeing the rise of the country to be one of the world's strongest super powers. Always at her beckoning call, although not always willingly, is her favourite, Lord Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson). A stronger, more devious and cunning character than his pathetic ancestor, Blackadder spends his time trying to make money, get his own way, and stop his servant Baldrick (Tony Robinson) from smelling quite so much.

Changed in personality and style, the characters of Blackadder and Baldrick are vastly different to those people knew from the previous series. No longer thick and cowardly, Blackadder is now a man to love. He is witty, intelligent, a ladies man and adored by many around him, most notably the Queen. In contrast, Baldrick is no longer the intelligent but loyal servant but a smelly idiot who is loyal probably more out of stupidity than anything. These new personalities were a miraculous change from the first series and it is wonderful that they came about because this new incantation of ""Blackadder"" is the finest ever made.

With stories covering some of the most famous people of the age, ""Blackadder II"" thrived on it's knowledge of history. Tony Curtis, a history enthusiast, and Ben Elton are sublime at mixing the daft with the dark to produce a series which would often be intentionally historically inaccurate, and which would never stop from being entertaining.

""Blackadder II"" would also introduce characters who would become cult favourites. People like Bob (Gabrielle Glaister) and Lord Flashheart (Rick Mayall) who would produce such laughs that they would be brought back in a later series. Others too, who were distinctive to this one series and who would become branded on the mind. Nursie (Patsy Byrne) also known as Bernard, who would come out with obscure and random comments. The baby eating Bishop Of Bath and Wells (Ronald Lacey), a man of depravity who would like nothing more than to stick a poker up where the sun doesn't shine. Characters like these would make this second chapter the finest, but ultimately it would be one regular character who truly made this the finest Blackadder series ever.

Nominated twice for Academy Awards, most people will probably always remember Miranda Richardson for playing the eccentric Queen Elizabeth. Childlike and with the power of life and death over all her subjects, Richardson's Elizabeth is a figure of beauty. Hilarious from the first time you see her through to the way her last line set up a Rowan Atkinson joke, few characters are as embedded on the mind as this one. Lusting after Blackadder, but never making the move, the character of Elizabeth is pure genius and she is perhaps the most fundamental reason why all other series of ""Blackadder"" felt lacking. Hugh Laurie's idiot prince in ""Blackadder III"" was a worthy attempt at trying to introduce a new monarch, but ultimately nobody can compare with this wonderful portrayal of good Queen Bess.

A complete change in style after the disappointing previous series, ""Blackadder II"" is one of the finest comedy series ever made. Funnier, with so many good characters, than the following two series, it stands out above most other British comedy as a target to reach for. It is genius in it's own right, and for that we should thank Elton and Curtis.",636,0,,0,No reference

It lacks the original title and inter titles, though some easy to read new inter titles have been added. The musical score is unremarkable, and while called original by the DVD box, seems ""canned."" Balduin is a poor student, but a great fencer. Apart from that, we don't learn very much about him or what he wants. He is, however, humiliated by his poverty. He wishes perhaps a rich heiress would marry him.A mephistophelian character named Scarpinetti offers to deliver on that, and in one scene dramatically stands atop a windy hill by a fallen tree gesturing towards a hunting party. They seem to follow his directions, which leads to a rich heiress having trouble with her horse near Balduin, who rescues her.However, this is just a tease from Scarpinetti. Balduin goes to visit the woman later, taking with him a flower from a poor flower girl (who seems sweet on him). He fidgets with the flower behind his back, and seems to be contemplating giving it to the rich woman, when her fiancé's large flower arrangement arrives. Balduin realizes he needs money to woo this woman (forgetting, seemingly, that he'd wanted a rich woman for money in the first place anyway).He makes a deal with Scarpinetti: 600,000 pieces of gold (! - error in the intertitle, maybe?) and Scarpinetti gets to take anything he wishes from Balduin's room. He manages to take Balduin's mirror reflection, and while that would seem to be the end of the deal, Scarpinetti still influences events in Balduin's life.There are some striking scenes in the movie, and some scenes that really drag. One that goes on for a long time is a party after someone had died, and there doesn't seem to be much purpose to it, or at least for it to have been so long.Balduin's mirror reflection doppelganger doesn't show up much, but figures in more towards the end, which is pretty satisfactory.

I was disappointed with it, frankly.

It was no better than the usual martial arts fare. And of course the moves are contrived and very fake.

No way can the sequences be better than the real classic, Bruce Lee v Chuck Norris way back in the 70s.

I could understand the character's seeming lack of emotion and stiffness, and Zhang Zhiyi's incredible about-turn from ready-to-fight to ready-to-have-a-roll-in-the-shack, but apart from that, this is not a film I would recommend to anyone, less so watching it again.

I know it will not appeal to many people because to some it is not Politically Correct showing the Chinese as bad guys ( especially Warner Oland ( who later played Charlie Chan) as the half white half Mongolian villain Chris Buckwell) and ( or) because it is a Silent Movie. The funny thing is there are equal opportunity bad people in the movie, not just Asian. There was John Miljan who played bad guy Don Luis ( Hispanic), and Andres Randolph ( Caucasian Lawyer Michael Brandon). spoilers ahead: What the story is really about is the greed of the people from the City Of San Francisco versus a traditional way of life that you see in the Vasquez Family. You see it with the murder of Don Hernandez de Vasquez brother because of the Gold Rush, and the death of Don Hernandez because of greed and Chris Buckwell. There are two things that represent the Vasquez Family: Their strong Catholic Faith and the family sword that they have used against their enemies. There is also a love story involving Delores and Irish Lawyer Terrence ( Terry) O'Shaughnessy ( Charles Emmitt Mack).He is the hero of the movie who saves the property from his uncle Andres ( who is working for Buckwell), then saves Delores from being raped by Buckwell, and finally rescues her after the earthquake. Basically, he will do whatever is necessary for her. Why? Take a look at Delores Costello. She was stunning. The only actresses in silent movies who looked better were Clara Bow and Renee Adoree. My favorite scene the final one with Terry and Delores and their daughter who is playing with the family sword in the family home which is in the Hills over the City Of San Francisco. It almost symbolizes the fact that not only did Delores Vasquez win, but the Vasquez Family way of life will continue on. 9/10 Stars.",340,0,,0,No reference

Here is a truly thoughtful satire that considers what it really means to be a ""hero"". More important, it seeks to find the heroic in everyday peoples' actions in the midst of a media culture that is constantly on the lookout for genuine heroes and, finding none, manufactures grandiose imitations instead.

The theme of heroism is everywhere in this film, and it might even sound like it is preaching a bit at times, particularly in Andy Garcia's final monologue on the subject. But it all comes together quite well and ends with a lot of heart. The acting is superb, the screenplay is focused, and I was amazed how well Hero combines the entertainment of fiction with the thoughtfulness of a documentary.

So finally I sat down to watch what is generally considered one of the greatest film comedies of all time. That is a lot to live up to and I didn't realize just how popular the film was until I logged on here to write this review. 8.4 on IMDb?! Now, please don't get me wrong...I enjoyed this movie. It was fun and wild and absolutely I can see how and why it pushed the limits back then. I'm not sure I have seen so many analogies and innuendos in one film. They were being shoved down your throat like a case of mistaken identity on Three's Company. The first analogy or clever innuendo is a chuckle and not much else but after the twentieth...it gets tired. The setting of 1929 makes some pretty intense action/gangster scenes even for the time. It was almost shocking to watch it now and that was kind of a neat mix to the comedy. Some of the comedic moments are almost dark in nature. I was surprised that I didn't really feel a lot of the humour had homophobic undertones which I thought would be a certainty. If anything, the very last gag in the film is almost pro-gay in some ways and it was definitely worth a laugh.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon were so young!! Curtis was handsome and fun and delivered his comedic moments perfectly. Lemmon was quirky and fun and certainly has legendary comedic timing. The two of them together are just awesome. A buddy film like this requires great chemistry and there is nothing short in their chemistry together. They seem like a bit of an odd-couple but they work great together. The stunning beauty of Marilyn Monroe and her sheer raw charisma on screen cannot be denied. When she first appears and every subsequent appearance you are just mesmerized. She's actually a much actress that I anticipated and her role is fun and breezy and perfectly performed by her. The chemistry between her and Curtis and even her and Lemmon is lacking. I didn't feel nearly any sparks between her and Curtis and that's really unfortunate. Romance is an important part of the film and it doesn't really fit well. George Raft is the perfect cookie cutter gangster. He is nothing more or less than the stereotypical ""Boss"" we would expect from a gangster flick. Same for his crew as well. They could have been lifted right from Dick Tracey. Dave Barry was a great supporting actor and gave some great comedy as the angry but stumbling Beinstock. Joan Shawlee is also good as the band leader and mother hen Sweet Sue. I also really enjoyed the campy and fun character played by Joe E. Brown as the man who falls for Lemmon's Daphne.I have no doubt that to see the true brilliance behind the film you would have to look at from the perspective of 1959 films and the time period. The movie is set in 1929 and I couldn't help but notice the inconsistencies in the timing. Its small things but certain products that weren't available in 1929 (Cheese Whiz for one) or just certain dialect. Its a small thing but worth noting nonetheless. The comedy is definitely balanced out by the more violent scenes in the film so it almost turns out a darker comedy that doesn't always fit the slapstick tone and concept of the movie. It is a fun movie and certainly is a classic that shows up on many lists of being a top film. I don't necessarily agree with that but who am I to deny a film that has stood up to 50+ years. For me, it didn't floor me but it was entertaining. 6.5/10",657,1,,0,No reference

I thought her Juliet speech was again vocally stiff, but inside of that was an amazing, young, excited, perfect Juliet. Every word was felt and communicated in an immediate sincere way that is hardly ever achieved in the role. The detail of THEATRE in NEW YORK in the 50's is wonderful.

First of all, the notion going around about the movie encouraging violence is absolute crap! This movie is about the real world, about truth. Just look around you, go through a newspaper, you will get a clear idea about the setup of the movie. I think the movie takes us through a journey of how society as a whole contributes to certain individuals loosing their minds and get drawn to violence. The lack of empathy in people, feeding on the weak, treachery and general animal instincts in people has led a large population to lead oppressed lives. And given the first push in the right (read wrong) direction can lead this oppressed people to chaos! Is the Joker a symbol, a motivational speaker, a leader? No. He is just one of the oppressed who has had enough. Many of us may have gone through social oppression but kept on behaving how we 'should', but not him. Not a person who was found beaten and tied to a radiator when he was just a child! The way we can relate to the character and feel his pain, confusion and despair is one of the main elements that has made this movie a massive success. Of course Joaquin's acting skills are on a whole different level, that makes your skin crawl. But do we hate him after the movie? No. We feel his pain, we put ourselves in his shoes and realize that we may have also acted the same in his situation. Joker is the most honest criticism of the ugly side of our society. We have seen and felt this all our lives, and kept smiling like him, the way we have been taught; but this is the first time the picture has been put in front of our eyes so skillfully.

Fine battles aside, there are a few neat moments: for example, a clever and effective ""character slowly overcomes a language barrier"" montage.The biggest flaw is how, Banderas aside, nearly all fellowship members remain underdeveloped - with the exceptions of leader Buliwyf and Ahmed's pal Herger, everyone else is a bearded, grim cypher.

Watching the films back to back its very surprising how 'advanced' the third film appears when compared to the orginal.While the first 2 (espically the first one) had a very gritty feel and look, AOD is more of a big budget film and seems to be targeted to a wider audience rather than 'slasher fans'. Also the gore factor seems to be reduced from the previous film.There is more jokes and humourless lines in this one and Ash is prehaps much more likable maybe due to the fact that he is both the big hero and an absolute coward at the same time.

This may be what drew Mason to the project, since he and Michael Powell jointly produced it, and that means they were serious. Mason must have wanted a jolly good holiday in the sun, far from his austere Switzerland where he lived, and a naked girl cavorting around him also must have seemed just the thing. That naked girl is none other than Miss Mironov, better known as Helen Mirren, and she was aged 24 at the time. Over the years I have become exasperated at hearing all my male friends gasp with lust about Mironov. She never did anything for me, but I am in the extreme minority, indeed have often been met with expostulations of disbelief when I confessed my indifference. What was wrong with me? That is a question many people have speculated about, without coming to any sound conclusions. If being turned off by Mironov is a sign of something, then I plead guilty. But apart from that, she is of course a superb actress, and she even does very well in this role which could easily have been silly. Instead, she manages to be convincing. And that was not easy, as the story is in so many ways ridiculous. This was Michael Powell's last effort at directing, after which he passed beyond the Great Barrier Reef. The film may be feeble in countless ways, but it is genuinely amusing and its affectionate sending-up of the Ossies by portraying wildly caricatured Ossie types was very funny. Mason's friend Nat, played by Jack MacGowran, is as outré as a character actor can get, but nevertheless believable. He overacts so emphatically that he is simply hilarious. Yes, the film is engrossing in its own bizarre fashion. For the time it was meant to be highly erotic, and doubtless was, but in those days, things were simpler. Even the phrase 'age of consent' is no longer used. After all, now that girls of ten are routinely pregnant, what is the 'age of consent' any longer but a fig leaf to mask the hypocrisy of the older people who insist on believing that young people are still demure? Today, the idea of a 24 year-old girl running around naked on a beach would not be a bit unusual, or even a 17 year-old, which is the supposed age of Mironov's character. There is no use taking this film seriously, instead it should be viewed as a comedy which was never intended to be anything but a romp. There is also a very clever dog star named Godfrey who gets a whole single screen credit to himself. (That is how whimsical this film really is!) His best trick is to rush back to the hut and slip his neck back into his collar which is tied up so that when James Mason arrives home, he does not know that Godfrey has been running along the beach playing for hours and, like all the people in this film, romping like mad.",656,0,,0,No reference

Be aware this is based on the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina the comic book series not the TV series Sabrina the Teenage witch. I can not wait for season two. All our favorite characters are back in this horror occult adaptation of one of our favorite growing franchises. They are all a little darker, and smarter than you may remember from the TV show.
It's very eerie show that at times is a little gory. It's got a Buffy or Charmed feel, but much more brutal and bloody.
It centers around Sabrina who is in those coming of age teenage angst years so be ready for a little bit of teen drama. Sabrina is an intelligent, driven, righteous, stubborn, at times naive in her quest for social justice, and a typical know it all teen. She is making mistakes and learning like any teen or young adult. Sometimes she has to learn the hard way. Overall she is strong character who sticks up for her friends and her beliefs. I really enjoyed the casting choice for Sabrina.
I wanted a little more from Salem. There could be a little more comedic relief to pay homage to the TV show, but for a suspenseful, horror, drama, thriller it's about what I would expect.
What a wonderful unexpected surprise of an Easter egg for me to find. I really enjoy this show.",237,0,,0,No reference

This movie really threw me a curveball with how good it was- I was expecting an American Tony Montana, bloodletting his competitors and snorting mountains of the white. Instead, an opprotunistic criminal-by-choice suffers heartbreak after heartbreak. It is strangely easy to feel sorry for him, as he isn't so much proud of what he does as he is proud of how well he does it. He's not a bad person- on the contrary, he loves his parents, treats his lovers well, and worships his daughter- and Depp captures it perfectly, yet again.The focus of the movie travels from Depp doing some small-time marijuana peddling on the California beaches, to importing bales of pot by plane, to becoming a cocaine king with the blessing and friendship of the notorious Pablo Escobar. All the while he approaches it as a professional, never seeming to truly care whether he gets any wealthier himself or doesn't. Indeed, when the game begins to run ahead of him, he lets it go, deciding instead to become a devoted father. The law, however, still has it in for one the biggest cocaine dealers in U.S. history, and his downfall is expected, yet still a sad state of affairs when it finally comes. He maintains his undying love for his daughter throughout the rest of the film, and you really feel that he doesn't give a damn about anything else in the world. It's this touching turn for the better that sets this one apart from the dozens of dark, moody drug movies that fail at the human aspect even as they succeed at the tough guy stuff. Nine out of ten, and about four of those go strait in Depp's pocket.",296,0,,0,No reference

The writing is ridiculous, the acting mostly totally flat and lame, the directing silly, and the editing seams to have been done completely at random by a five year old.

The guy and his wife don't have any kids so he fills that void by being an uncle figure to the local boys, including the son of the guy who is accused of murder. He comes off as a little pushy and even creepy to me. The weirdest part is that he is largely responsible for getting the guy in trouble in the first place. On top of that he seems anxious to step in and replace the dad in the kid's life.

Some scenes go on forever with no comedic payoff, such as the obligatory scenes where Bullock's character is taken off the case. There is also a great amount of idiot plot going on. The film would be solved immediately if all the characters weren't idiots. Making the head of the Las Vegas FBI into a guy who does not follow obvious leads is absolutely ridiculous.

You could tell they were sorry to be in the film. I think what looked good on paper became a disaster in production.My problem with this movie is three fold. The pacing is slow, the characters are mostly cardboard, and the story line is pretty boring. There were three good laughs that were okay, but two shock scenes that they should be ashamed of. There's nothing funny about presenting facts about past events where someone was killed or maimed due to another persons abject stupidity.There are certainly facts here (things based on mistakes made during the Vietnam war) that can shock a few people who don't remember or never heard of the drug culture of the 60s. But overall it's just military bashing. There is no story. This is just an array of mindless skits and ignorant plot points.It's easy to make fun of the military for their past mistakes, but the writer of this film had the advantage of hindsight to slap them around with. How many mistakes are we making now? Depleted uranium? Defective flack jackets? Would anyone be justified in making fun of soldiers who died defending this country?

Given the degree of sex, violence, and unadulterated exploitation of slavery in the antebellum South, that's a surprise, because I saw this flick nearly ten years ago and STILL can't forget it! Those whose image of the old South has forever been defined by GONE WITH THE WIND as romantic and chivalrous and pick up this movie in the video store(the cover art on the box resembles that famous pose with Gable and Leigh)thinking they're about to be trasported to Tara ought to run like Hell! James Mason and his lame son Perry King live on a plantation and own slaves body and soul. Well, at least the body part, as we see when Mason strings an errant slave upside down, strips him, and pattles his butt with a perforated paddle. Son King takes a more tender approach, as he sleeps with the female slaves, especially Brenda Sykes, whom he takes as his mistress. However, he marries Susan George to provide an heir, and presents her with a ruby choker. He also gives Sykes the matching earrings. When George learns of the relationship(Sykes wears the earrings while she serves dinner to George and King on their first night at the plantation), and Kings learns George has slept with her brother, the marriage hits the skids. George drowns her sorrows in lots of sherry and lots of Ken Norton, a slave Perry has purchased specifically for fighting other slaves for betting. George becomes pregnant, and when the baby comes, it hits the fan! It's hard to believe that anyone in 1975 could see this film as anything but exploitation of a very dark period in American history. Didn't anyone cringe at the sight of King going in to ""take pleasure"" from a female slave in a bed and the woman groans, ""I too black for you"", or Ken Norton standing stoically on the auction block of a slave sale while an old woman gropes around inside his loincloth? The video edition of this film I saw was from the early eighties, when movie studios did their transfers from the first worn-out prints the could grab, and may have had a muddy, faded look because of this, but it's hard to believe this thing came from a major studio. You'd certainly wouldn't know it from the production values, because the film looks as if the filmmakers didn't spend a penny more than they had to(we're treated to interior scenes inside a plantation house curiously devoid of furniture). With all these setbacks, it's hard to understand why this movie hasn't garnered even a semi-cult following.

Because the film approaches the matter from three perspectives it should have been a TV series rather then a movie because we just quickly go from one person to another without much details, then to another news story, and so on. That is why it feels so rushed. The female heavyweight cast (C. Theron, N. Kidman, M. Robbie) did not make an impression, because they all have so much similarities from hair styles and make-up to facial expressions. Actually it is male character (J. Lithgow) who steals the film.

Silva, as the titular inspector Sterling, is out for revenge and to clear his name. He got framed by local mobsters, undoubtedly with help from within the police corps, and trialed for killing an informant. The mobsters also killed his son, but surprisingly enough, he seems less upset about that then about the frame-up. ""The Falling Man"" isn't dull or bad, but it's very predictable and contains far too many overlong and redundant sequences. There is, for example, a lot of footage of Silva simply staring dazed and confused into the distance, or repeating pieces of flashbacks into his head that aren't even very relevant. It's very easy to guess who the secretive ""Charlie"" is, and the body count lies much too low for an Italian crime-thriller. The music is great, though, and blond actress Beba Loncar looks ravishing. Too bad her role is fairly small.PS: in the fantastic documentary ""Eurocrime! The Italian Cop and Gangster Films That Ruled the '70s!"", it's explained how the city of San Francisco charges film productions for the use of footage of the famous Golden Gate bridge in their movies.

It is obvious that the writer/director cared about presenting something genuine and touching - rather than some plot driven smash-a-thon. I could relate to the themes. They were telegraphed so clearly, however, there were no real surprises. We could see each line and exchange and development coming from a mile away - and the movie took forever to get to each tiny step (it's 2 hours and 15 minutes).It pains me a bit to say it, but the movie's glacial pace and repetitive nature slowed it down a bit too much. And how it would linger over each small movement in the two kids' relationship, and then go back over it and over it and over it - made it feel repetitive. I suspect women might find this more of a match to their style of fantasizing? If the movie wasn't so earnest, and ""real"" in some very authentic ways, I would have found it annoyingly tedious. Didn't quite happen, though. I was surprised to find myself flashing back to some very sweet moments from my own teen-aged love affairs. It was sweetly evocative in that way, which I appreciated. I can't remember seeing a movie depicting the development of love with ""youths"" turning into adults so authentically and with so much meaning for me. Usually romances are either rom-coms, or formula set-ups, or twinky vampire book treatments. Or set pieces from current hip culture. This was none of those. This was nice. Sloooow, but nice.Although the very predictable (and extremely limited and overly simple) plot points failed to ""move"" me particularly - it was interesting but no big drama - I was generally liking all the characters. I was glad for the characters finding romance, and I enjoyed reliving a bit of my romantic development in a fresh way no other movie had managed to do.

1490,809031,2004-08-03,rmax304823,Road to Zanzibar (1941),7.0,"Of the comedy teams that made a series of movies in the 1940s and 1950s, Hope and Crosby were probably the most engagingly amusing.

Abbott and Costello were usually silly. Their movies seemed aimed at an audience of children, although some, like ""Meet Frankenstein"", are outrageous. There was an element of sadism too, with Abbott (always the humorless straight man) slapping the helpless Costello around and snarling at him, a standard relationship left over I guess from vaudeville where clowns batted each other over the head with bladders.

Martin and Lewis were clearly differentiated. Martin was the parent and Lewis was the twelve-year-old child. It all seems a bit much, now.

But Hope and Crosby were the most nearly equal. Crosby was the smooth-talking crooner. Both were cowards but Hope was a braggart too, a stock figure in the comedies of Ancient Rome and afterward. I think the figure was called miles gloriosus. What they had that the other teams didn't, and what's on good display here, is a kidding quality that consists of trying to outwit one another, competition for the girl (Dorothy Lamour), inside jokes, and a kind of comfortably relaxed unspoken friendship that draws the audience in.

In many ways the funniest scene is when Hope and Crosby realize they've been double crossed by Lamour and set out to find her and tell her off. They discover some shreds of her clothing and conclude, mistakenly, that she's been eaten by leopards and carried off. (Hope: ""They didn't even leave an ear. What hogs those leopards are."") The two men try to mourn her passing in a sincere and dignified way but their anger at her keeps simmering to the surface. They interrupt their weeping to recite some poetry over her buried clothing but they don't know any poems. Hope starts off with, ""A bunch of the boys were whooping it up/ in the Malamut saloon..."" Crosby chides him and instead begins to recite ""Casey at the Bat."" The scene simply cracks me up. Crosby: ""She was just a kid."" Hope: ""We'll miss her. Even though she was WRONG!"" When they realize she's still alive they sneer and kick away the dirt from her ""grave.""

I don't think of ""The Road to Zanzibar"" as necessarily their best Road picture, although it's right up there with ""Utopia"" and ""Morocco."" It was basically their first though. The earlier ""Road to Singapore"" lacked the lazy improvisational impression that this one has. ""Singapore"" seems, in retrospect, too well plotted, if you can imagine. You've gotta give these guys a little room to kick out.

The plot's absurd anyway. Africa on the Paramount set, with phony drums and ""natives"" and a guy in a gorilla suit engaged in a professional wrestling match with Hope. Actually, Hope's pretty amusing. Woody Allen has said that he picked up quite a few of Hope's comic mannerisms to use in his own performances. (See also Hope's ""They've Got Me Covered,"" a classic of its kind, so to speak.) And Crosby is a necessary counterpart to Hope's physicality. The two work very well together.

I'll have to throw in one of their exchanges. The pair find themselves broke and stranded in a small African town.

Hope (gloomily): ""This must be the nowhere that people say they're 500 miles from.""

Crosby: ""Well don't blame me. We wouldn't be here if you hadn't sold the map to that diamond mine.""

Hope: ""Hah! It's your fault! If you hadn't bought it I wouldn't have had it. And if I didn't have it I couldn't sell it. So if I couldn't sell it, then we wouldn't be stuck here, would we?""

Crosby: ""Nope.""

Hope (looks doubtful for a moment, thinking hard): ""I don't get it.""

Their movies also produced a number of popular songs, some of which have become standards. This one has ""It's Always You."" Others have songs like ""Moonlight Becomes You.""

Hangover/Change-Up writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore both write and direct this comedy and is gladly an improvement from their first main feature 21 & Over. Interestingly, the director of the Hangover trilogy also has a release at this month; War Dogs. 

We see Kunis come under pressure of being a mother of two (probably three if you include the immature husband played by David Walton) and constantly fighting against time and perfection to be a good mum. Especially under the watchful eye of the impeccable mothers Jada Pinkett Smith, Annie Mumolo (well maybe not so much Mumolo) and uber bitch Christina Applegate who happens to be head of the PTA. 

Things go from bad to worse for Kunis and she snaps, going from trying her damn best to breaking all the rules and forms an unlikely alliance with not-so-ideal moms Kathryn Hahn who is outrageously crazy and has the best lines of the movie and fellow Sarah Marshall star, Kristen Bell who's the innocent, under-the-thumb mum that needs to break free and grow some balls. The only common traits they share is the mothering instinct for their children and the hatred of trying to be perfect moms. 

We see a more human Jay Hernandez than his recent Diablo from Suicide Squad and I was quite happy to see Kick-Ass' Clark Duke playing an immature and demanding boss, someone else Kunis had to mother. But it's massive shout out to Oona Lawrence, who plays the highly-strung daughter, obsessed with being on the soccer team and in real life, who happens to be in two major releases at the cinema at the same time; the other being Pete's Dragon. You go girl! 

It boasts an superb soundtrack with current dance tracks from Demi Lovato, Icona Pop and DNCE, especially the supermarket sweep scene and the sorority party, the craziness from Hangover really shines through. 

It's quite long and while it gets a little cheesy towards the end, it still projects a good underlining message, same kind of feel good feeling I experienced from Crazy, Stupid, Love and there's a nice touch during the end credits with the stars own real life mothers joining them on the couch sharing their own experiences at motherhood. It's funny, entertaining and certainly one of the better comedies I've seen this year. 

Running Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 7 Direction: 8 Story: 7 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Point: 10 for the end credit sofa moms, supermarket sweep and therapist Wanda Sykes.

A pair of dancing sweethearts carry on a private romance in a very public department store window.

TIP TAP TOE is an enjoyable little film and serves primarily as a showcase for its incredibly lithe & limber young stars Hal LeRoy and Mitzi Mayfair, stars of the Ziegfeld Follies of 1931. The story is very silly, but agreeable, and the plot doesn't get too much in the way of the highly energetic duo.

Often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel.

The bad news is that it portrays the Irish as extremely profane people who do nothing but scream at each other and tell each other to f-off. That wears thin after awhile. Everyone says this: young and old. One hopes this isn't representative of the entire country.

The movie also has as one of the characters an older trumpet player who is portrayed as a ""religious"" man who wears crosses and says the Lord told him to do this and do that.

As a monster Burton fan I have to say I was very letdown and disappointed with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and I thought his best stuff was long behind us. This time NO ONE booed the film. Burton, Depp,Carter, and Elfman actually produced something here this time. It was like seeing the old Beetlejuice cartoons over again and remind you why you like the man's films so much (even though he didn't have too much to do with the cartoons). I'm glad to say I will actually get this one on DVD, continue to be the fan I was since the late 80s, and enjoy cinema in the way I did as a child growing up. And JUST because everyone is comparing it to NightmareBeforeChristmas...I will say I like this one better (settle down... NBC was a good Burton flick too). hehehe.

Man of Steel, based on the original Superman series, was released in 2013. The movie is about Clark Kent whose origins are another planet called Krypton. When Clark was just a baby his mother and father sent him to planet earth in a spaceship to avoid the destruction he would face in Krypton. Sent to earth and genetically encoded with Krypton's race, Clark originally named Kal-El, lands in the small town of Smallville where he is found by Martha and Jonathon Kent, who with no children of their own, raise Clark as their own. Jonathan aims to keep Clark's origin and powers a secret as he doesn't want his son exploited. Compare that to typical child stars parents who exploit the daylight out of them. He is a great father who passes away and this is very hard on Clark as they were very close. The movie brings out the return of Commander Zod who originally murdered Clark's biological father and after being sent to the Phantom Zone returns with those who were banished with him. He goes to earth to hunt Clark down asking for Kal-El but Zod is full of deceit and lies. He tricks Clark and Lois Lane, a reporter whom everyone knows Clark falls head over heals over, to going with him as he tells them he needs the codex to save planet earth, but what he wants to do with the codex is make the earth a new Krypton and fill the earth with clones of Kryptonians that are genetically engineered. Will Clark Kent be able to save the day? I enjoy watching Superman movies and I hope there will be many more to come. Now, I can't help but to say this - did anyone else notice the comparisons between Superman and Jesus? This was a good movie! - Asif Zamir",326,0,,1,Reference to other reviews
1498,2956376,2015-10-16,jarrodmcdonald-1,Arrowhead (1953),,"In ARROWHEAD, we have Charlton Heston as a white Cavalry scout who once spent several years of his childhood with the Apaches. He has since rejoined white civilization and he now has nothing but contempt for the native people around him. So by fifties' standards, he is supposed to be the Injun-hating hero.Add into the mix Jack Palance as an Apache who was sent east to be educated by white men. But while he was at school in Pennsylvania, he refused to cut his long hair and act much like a white. Now he's come home to Texas, where he will take off his hat, show off his long hair proudly and declare he is still Apache, which means instant conflict with Heston's character.This all seems rather interesting, until the script takes both characters in a somewhat vicious direction. Heston is given all kinds of dialogue that today seems quite politically incorrect, where he disparages the Apaches, calling one of them dirt. But the tipping point, where we learn who the filmmakers want us to root for, is when Palance goes into an office to meet a white guy he once played with as a child. He has decided that it was a mistake for an Apache to have bonded like a blood brother with a white man. Just as the man goes to call his wife and young son to meet Palance's character, Palance pulls a gun out and shoots him at point blank range, instantly killing his old friend. It is depicted as a senseless brutal act.Of course, this sets into motion a series of scenes where Heston as the good guy must avenge the other white man's death and bring Palance and his lawless Apaches to justice. As I said, it's hard to decide whether either one of them should be who we root for. Do we root for Palance who is filled with his own blind rage against whites and trying to seek vengeance against those who have taken so much from his own people? Or do we root for Heston who supposedly has law and order (and civilization) on his side, but is filled with just as much contempt toward the natives?",367,0,,0,No reference

1501,2309086,2012-06-24,cultfilmfan,Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012),10.0,"Imagine that the end of the world is coming, so what would you do in the time you have left on Earth? Instead of being a science fiction film with facts, numbers, explosions, or action the film takes a different look at what two people could possibly experience given the situation at hand. The film follows a recently single insurance salesman named Dodge, who is accepting of the upcoming news about the world and it's potential end, but that is not what is bothering him. Mass chaos, hysteria, rioting, or the likes do not seem to bother him. Instead what is on his mind is connecting, connecting with someone and being able to love and be loved and find some sort of acceptance and friendship. He unexpectedly finds that in a young woman named Penny, who considers herself an optimist, but at the same time seems to be quite eccentric in a way where you are not really sure if the straight laced Dodge, will be accepting of her, or not, or vice versa, but as the film goes along the characters do bond with one another and find common grounds of love, acceptance and friendship despite their age difference, background and everything else that could be considered a problem. They go for an adventure together and while along the way, there is several moments of humour and unexpected situations, what is really at the core and I think the message of the film is acceptance and love and finally finding the right person to be with. The end of the world part of the film is just used as a backdrop for this to further speed up events, so for those looking for an effects, or action driven film, look elsewhere. Here we have soul searching characters and an honest yet humbling look at relationships and how one overcomes to an extent, their loneliness and are finally able to connect with someone who may be that special one. When, I saw that the reviews for this film were quite mixed with critics and audiences alike after I saw the film, I was really surprised. This for me, is the type of film that I would like to see at the cinema more often. It had moments of humour, it had a certain offbeat quality to it and just the wonderful look and dissection of human emotions and here mainly being loneliness and acceptance with these two similar, but in many ways different characters I found to be realistic, honest and at the same time beautiful. I left the theatre not in a panic thinking about the end of the world, but instead reflecting on what I just saw and starting to think and re-evaluate my own life, priorities and thinking that love is really the key and the answer to this film and isn't that what most of life is about as well? Many religions teach love, acceptance and turning the other cheek. In schools we are taught to accept others no matter what they may look like, or despite them not being always like us. In our society today throughout our life through religion, our places of education and even later on in the workplace, we are taught a certain level of tolerance and acceptance of others. Sometimes it is hard and we may not always connect, or get along with others, but when we do connect with several people, or even if it is just that one special person who holds a special place in your heart, doesn't it make all the other things worth it? To be accepted just as who you are and loved despite your flaws and eccentricities and having someone like you for you and not always having to put on a front, or be someone else to them, just yourself. People find that often in pets, online relationships, with significant others, friends, groups at work and many other places. I think the answer to so many of life's difficult challenges and the encumbrances and emotional turmoil we go through on perhaps a daily basis could all be lessened, or not feel quite as bad if we had that one person who we could connect with and bond, or even to embrace and love. These are just some of the things that I got walking away from this film and to be honest I thought about it for quite some time after I saw it. Thinking that I do have those loves in my life from family, friends, religion, work and many other things, shows me that I am not alone and I have a support base and people who do love and accept me for myself and not someone that I am pretending to be. The film touched my heart and warmed my soul by presenting this to me and getting me to think about it. It invokes questions in the viewer that should perhaps be asked and answered. The performances in this film were great and I would have to say that this is definitely Steve Carell's best performance to date and I continue to hope to see him in other dramatic works. First time director Lorene Scafaria, does what some directors take whole years of their lives to convey in their films, and she does it with her first attempt. She connected with her characters and allows us to do the same and we are very thankful for the privilege. This girl certainly knows about character study, emotions and what it really feels like out there and for being honest about it and bringing it to the screen in a very entertaining and satisfying way, I thank her. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is the best film I have seen this year so far and will definitely be among my favorites by the end of the year.",981,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

1503,1104343,2006-01-06,ghoulieguru,The Cave (2005),5.0,"Here's a crazy thing... Before this movie started on the DVD, they showed the MPAA rating. Next to the PG-13 rating it said: Rated PG-13 for creature violence.Creature violence! How great is that? The MPAA used to just base their ratings on potboiler terms like: violence, nudity, sexual situations. Now they've actually given creature movies their own rating system! I wonder if this was the first movie to be rated for creature violence. I never noticed it before, but I thought it was noteworthy. Anyway...In THE CAVE, a bunch of wacky spelunkers decide to descend into some mysterious caverns and awaken something terrible. It's a fairly standard set-up for a horror movie, but what THE CAVE has going for it is a fairly interesting little twist.The movie starts off in standard fashion. The story of Ten Little Spelunkers who start disappearing one by one. In the brief glimpses we get of the creature, we are led to believe that it might be some big mutated bat. I know what you're thinking, sounds pretty lame. I was in the middle of rolling my eyes and picking at my navel lint when the movie took an unexpected turn.Okay, now here comes a big spoiler. If you don't know what the twist is and you want to be surprised, stop reading now. But if you're curious as to why I went from thinking this was a fairly typical creature movie to actually enjoying it, then read on...See, the monster that's prowling around down in the caves is actually a parasite that gradually transforms its host into a monster. The guy who gets bitten/ infected is played by an actor that I've seen before but I can't remember his name. He's kind of like the poor man's Tom Berenger. Anyway, he gets infected and starts transforming into something more than human. His fellow spelunkers are all worried about him as his pupils turn all funny and his hearing gets extra sharp. If you remember how that one Marine went all buggy in THE ABYSS, it's kind of like that.In horror movies you usually either have an external enemy, and everyone has to band together to fight this horrible thing. Or the enemy is within, and everyone has to figure out who the killer is inside their little group before they all get sliced and diced. This horror movie has a little bit of both. It's about an external enemy and the enemy within. That's what I liked about it.Luckily for our plucky spelunkers, budget Tom Berenger decides that he's going to go against the creatures that infected him and help his cave-climbing comrades get to safety. Rounded out nicely by an ending that brings to mind SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, DARKMAN and THE FRENCH CONNECTION (and if you aren't intrigued by those three completely different references, you probably need to take some Gingko), THE CAVE winds up being a notch above your basic creature flick.And it's rated PG-13 for CREATURE VIOLENCE!

1507,866221,2004-12-12,Danny_G13,Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004),8.0,"I was appalled by the first Resident Evil film. As a big fan of the games it was based on I hoped for something which tied in with it. Indeed, George Romero agreed with this philosophy and coined a script featuring recognisable characters from the franchise, and a similar setting. This script got him fired and the final movie bore pretty much no resemblance to the games bar the locale of Raccoon City and the name of the Umbrella Corporation. If alienating the fans wasn't bad enough, the actual quality of the picture was quite dismal, and though it was successful on the name, the film content left the majority of neutral viewers fairly apathetic, and actual fans mildly annoyed. Bearing this in mind, the sequel would have to rectify a lot of the mistakes the first one made, and contrive something far better than the original.They succeeded admirably.Apocalypse picks up exactly where the original left off, with Milla Jovovich's Alice staggering out of some kind of Umbrella medical installation to be greeted by the chaos of the town of Raccoon City under the state of emergency the outbreak of T-Virus has left it in.However, Umbrella have plans to use the situation to their advantage by way of the Nemesis program, and endeavour to test their bio weapons within the carnage.Meanwhile the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) members are still in Raccoon City and trying to escape, but after Nemesis slaughters a crew of them, it is left to the few remaining ones to try and escape. They are flanked by Alice who doesn't feel quite herself any more...Resident Evil Apocalypse succeeds on the vast majority of levels the original feebly capitulated at. Firstly, and very importantly, there are far more references to the actual games in evidence. Carlos Oliveira, Jill Valentine, Nemesis, an Ashford reference; there are more than enough superficial homages to the games to satisfy the connoisseurs. Moreover, the 'feel' of the movie is vastly more akin to the games. Rather than the slightly sci-fi sanitised original which felt a million miles from the games, this one gets the scenarios and general ambiance closer to what purists wanted. Also in evidence here is the fact it's a mix of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis video games. Jill has her Nemesis outfit on, Carlos from 3 is here, the underground lab from 2 is featured. There are plenty of game links to satisfy. Sure, there are some slight modifications to the game plot, with certain details quite different, but you don't find yourself holding such facts against the film.Secondly, and crucially, the actual movie itself outside of being faithful to anything is a genuinely enjoyable tale. Sure, it's hardly realistic, with plenty of gravity-defying stunts and absurd moments of combat, but it demands you suspend your disbelief for the duration and assuming your compliance you'll get a kick out of the action and explosions et al.Then we have Alexander Witt's far more engaging direction compared to Paul Anderson's drab attempt in the first movie. Witt achieves an engaging ride here, always making each scene buzz with life. Never a dull moment in this one.The cinematography is more than competent as well, with some great aerial shots and some effective street scenes. You feel part of the action at all times, and you're certainly never bored. Set layout is especially good, so good you actually don't notice it.Finally the acting. OK, that's always going to be a weakness here, but besides the corny accents and overdose of cheesy dialogue the actors do a decent job of getting on with proceedings. Hell, they even manage to look like they're enjoying themselves. But this film is not about acting; clearly the narrative is centre stage. And as a result of a reasonable script, good direction, and close ties to the game, Resident Evil Apocalypse manages on every level its predecessor failed at.If you're a fan, highly recommended. If you're not, you will probably still get a blast out of it.",673,0,,0,No reference

When the consequences do show themselves in the form of the girl being pregnant she pays him a visit and drops the bombshell on him.Films like this one have been made before. Nine Months Later (1995) comes to mind but there are a lot more examples. This film isn't entirely different from any of them apart from one thing: it doesn't really pick a genre. Parts of it are comedy, parts of it are tragedy, parts of it are the basic high school/underpants junk, parts are feel good film. It does keep itself together pretty well though. The two of them combining is hard to believe but not so hard that it is impossible and even though it is as predictable as the cycle of night and day it isn't entirely unpleasant to watch.Personally I would have liked to have seen a little less broad pick of genres.

It's an attempt to be funny and emotional at the same time, with a sophisticated character (Lisa) who often feels things deeply. Lisa the Greek works as a comedy, but as a drama it's not up there with Lisa's Substitute. Then again, not every episode has to be like Lisa's Substitute.Lisa doesn't like how Homer never takes an interest in her and Marge suggests Lisa should instead take an interest in Homer's activities. They watch football together, and Homer realizes Lisa has a gift for picking the team that's likeliest to win. He gambles with her help and wins a lot of money, giving gifts to Marge who's perplexed as to where the money's coming from. When she learns the truth she's upset that Lisa, as a child, is getting involved in gambling. Things turn ugly when, with the football season coming to a close, Homer is no longer interested in spending time with Lisa.The way this episode ends- Lisa says the outcome of the Superbowl will reveal whether she loves or hates Homer- doesn't actually involve Homer making up for his selfishness. Still, the fact that they go climbing together is sweet. What's interesting about this episode is seeing Homer and Lisa bond after the two seemed so distant in Lisa's Substitute. This episode starts out the same way, with Homer not wanting to sit close to Lisa when they first started watching football- something which, as noted in the DVD commentary, is harsh. But sometimes harsh is funny. It's not the best of the Lisa episodes, but it's a solid effort.",288,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

I bailed out on this film about half way after recognising that I would never care about what happened to such unbelievably portrayed individuals, or the revolting society in which they were so used.This is all very disappointing compared to Remains of the Day, which managed to transcend the artificiality of its setting to at least allow us to believe that the characters might act as they did.If Never Let Me Go is an attempt at a sci-fi dystopia, then it fails. If its meant as a novel to convey a message about our humanity then it fails utterly.On the plus side, it was quicker to watch half of this ghastly and pointless film than it would have been to read half of the novel.

As far as bad guys go Bane is pretty much the epitome of the character type. I personally feel the villains in the trilogy is what makes them so special. The story is great and engaging, it was so good I didn't even realize that the runtime was over 2 hours. If you like dark, gritty, and/or action movies its a must watch. Also it should be noted that you should watch the first 2 films in the series otherwise some stuff might not add up. It wraps up everything in the trilogy and answers pretty much every question you could have. How it relates back to the first movie is quite impressive and after watching this one you'll probably try your best 'bane impression.' His voice is as memorable as his stature.

1522,4571222,2019-12-09,fedor8,惡靈20 (V) (2019),,"The movie decides to be annoying early on. It doesn't wait. It goes for the annoyance straight away almost.First it offers us an incredibly dumb premise: some kind of half-witted, absurd, unrealistic juvenile delinquent program that actually intentionally strands teens, one by one, one per deserted island, for THREE days. Count 'em. Three. Not just overnight. A kind of Naked & Afraid except no naked. Is this ridiculously far-fetched program run with any safety precautions at least? No. Are the kids able to alert the woman Kay for help if something happens to them? No, they can't. How are they supposed to survive three days and nights without proper skills after just two weeks of ""training""? Kay has no clue, she just dumps them there. Why are they being dumped on islands that aren't deserted? Kay wouldn't know, she's part of a moronic program which doesn't take danger into consideration, at all. Well then, how many people run this program? Just the one, Kay, it seems. She dumps them on islands, then comes alone - at night - to pick them up several days later in a crappy tiny boat which apparently she alone inhabits. So she's program boss, skipper and counselor? Yup. In Toby's case, she actually arrives EARLIER than planned - which is stupid, because how is dopey Toby supposed to meet her? He'd been expecting her in the morning. Sillier still, she calls out his name upon arrival, as if she'd just landed into a house, not a vast island. That's how smart she is. That's how smart this movie is.Hence, logically, this dumb program must be setting kids on RANDOM islands. If that weren't so, then Kay would not have chosen the dangerous horror island - which the program couldn't have used before, because if they had then Kay and some other kid would have been killed earlier. So it's a Juve program that not only endangers teens but doesn't even use the same - hence more reliable - islands every time... Wow. Now, that is so idiotic.Why is dopey Toby even in this program? It's supposed to be a Juve program, yet where is the evidence he ever did anything criminal? There is none. His father got killed by masked men, so obviously he gets sent to a Juve program on the other side of the world, run by a daft woman called Kay. Makes so much sense.But hey, the lost and confused writer-director needed an isolated setting in which a lost and confused dopey Toby could get no help hence where he could be easily killed off.Secondly, the writer-director decides to annoy us with the usual, by now standard and expected, liberal propaganda. Yes, even in a remote-island monster flick we don't get spared the usual PC nonsense. Dopey Toby mumbles something about ""Robinson Crusoe"" being ""very progressive"" for its time because it pushed the gay-rights agenda. And, apparently, because the book addresses ""western colonialism"" i.e. the film manages to throw in a little bit of white-guilt too. LGBT and white guilt: cute. Because the writer-director is genuinely brainwashed or because he wants to suck up to Hollywood's Establishment? It's no secret that the capital of American cinema hires only politically subservient sycophants these days. Find me a Hollywood director or writer younger than 50 who isn't a liberal and I'll find you Hangars 18, 19 and 20, all full of goofy-looking aliens. Reverse McCarthyism? It's because McCarthy wasn't allowed to do his job that we have what we have now...Besides, if the writer-director wants to suck up to Unholywood, then he should have included Global Warming too. Doesn't he realize that EVERY movie now has to include at least one message about the impending Armageddon? Manbearpig would definitely NOT approve of this blatant omission. Sure, gay rights and white guilt are all well and fine, but to fail to include THE trendy agenda of the moment is a pretty ignorant move from this director. He needs to be more aware of Global Whorening, if he wants to successfully who-re himself out to UnHolywood.Thirdly, the movie presents us a dopey Toby who is initially introverted, depressed and glum. He doesn't say a word on the boat. And yet, as soon as he is dumped on the island by Kay, he goes into ""comedy relief"" monologue-banter, being uncharacteristically jovial. So why this sudden, absurd transformation? I was half-expecting a third Toby to show up, one who was a martial arts expert. Well, why not? After all, they already gave us two Tobys within just 10-15 minutes! There should have been at least 5-6 more Tobys by the time this pathetic film mercifully ends.It gets dumber. It always does in such films. He comes across a lanky fashion model, very much a jungle version of Lara Croft. She turns out to be the monster. We find this out in a very silly exposition scene in which a woman gives us the whole story... while being freshly impaled by a tree-trunk. Any explanation as to what these Americans were doing on a remote Asian jungle island in the first place? Of course not. Any explanation how people can talk on and on while being freshly impaled by a tree trunk? None. Admittedly, no such explanation exists, at least not in this universe.The girl's appearance is totally unconvincing, looking like she walked straight out of Vogue magazine. She doesn't remotely resemble a ""feral child"" from the jungle who'd spent a decade there. I half-expected her to ask Tobey whether he had some coke stashed away somewhere. Her character isn't much smarter than a fashion model either: she never figures out that she's the monster, in all those years, which is fairly far-fetched - yet so typical of this inept writer-director.Very predictably dopey Toby gets the woman killed before she could tell him the truth. WHY couldn't Toby have listened to her before escaping?! It's so dumb. They get involved in an absurd jungle chase (because clearly this writer-director has only been in special plastic jungles with built-in running tracks hence believes people can just run, skip and hop freely there at great speeds). She runs into one of her own traps - which is so dumb on so many levels, i.e. yet another lame plot-device. As if we hadn't realized that she isn't the killer. Far too convenient the way the director shows her coming out of Kay's boat carrying Kay's belongings. It is obvious audience manipulation, obvious plot-devicing.Nor is it clear where from the black Rasta kid suddenly appears. He mumbles something about him and Toby going back to his island. This would imply he SWAM all the way to Toby's! Did he? How did he do that? Why did he do that?Actually, it's totally irrelevant. It's a dumb movie. If the writer-director doesn't know, how should we.I wish the director all the best with his Hollywood-hunting. May he land a dozen big-budget movie deals there. Just as long as he finally includes Global Warming propaganda in his next awful flicks, because NOT including Global Warming these days - i.e. just years before we all get cooked by the effects of unbridled capitalism when Earth hits temperatures of 1500 C - is really just not on.",1209,0,,0,No reference

As the description states, woman walking alone at night, abducted with chloroform, wakes up with arms and legs bound on a gurney, and is then drugged while this hideous yet delicious masked maniac proceeds to dismember then disembowel her.I'd never seen an autopsy at that point, so I had no real reference point of what cutting deep into flesh looked like. But to me, this looked extremely real. The only thing that really was a give away were the different camera angles. Had this all been filmed in one take, from a single camera, I would have bet money (lots) that this were a real 'snuff' film.It would have been impossible to get all the precision shots and gory (quite literally) details had it been filmed in that way. I remember watching this, unblinking nearly, and feeling such a guilty joy. There is an instance where the woman, still apparently alive but very heavily drugged, vomits blood into the air (she's on her back and it isn't quite projectile, but forceful) and I could not conceive how that effect was done. Another give away that I just recalled, was that there was no genitalia shown at all. I find that so weird with Japanese/Asian horror...You see all kinds of graphic brutality, but no genitals. Huh. So after he has removed her limbs and then disembowels her, he scoops out one of her eyes with a spoon. And then proceeds to behead her. After that is finished, you go into the maniac's kitchen, maybe? There are many body parts and strange specimen jars. Interesting eye candy.

We see life through the eyes of Saroo (portrayed by Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel), who unfortunately gets onto a train that takes him far far away from home. This journey is one that forces Saroo to grow up very quickly, and when he gets adopted by a loving Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman), he gets a sense of stability and opportunity. But it isn't too long before he gets the itch to locate his ""real"" home and family.What 'Lion' does very well is tell the story of Saroo through beautiful visuals and sound. The soundtrack adds to the magic of the story, and the majestic landscapes of India and Australia are shown throughout. In terms of acting, Patel and Kidman especially deliver strong performances. Rooney Mara also doesn't disappoint as the girlfriend of Saroo, as she is a pivotal force during a time when he questions many things. And then of course Google does a fine job in its supporting role. There are also many themes that take center stage during 'Lion,' from identity to forgiveness and, of course, family - whether real or adopted.'Lion' is a powerful film that carries a strong message and serves as a beacon for all those who are separated from their families but still believe they will find their way home.",311,0,,0,No reference

1547,1382436,2007-01-23,dee.reid,Saw III (2006),8.0,"It was a few weeks before Halloween 2006 that I was able to get my hands on the uncut edition of ""Saw II"" (2005) and, boy, was that a nasty entry in this horror series. But the third film, ""Saw III"" is probably the best yet, following the first ""Saw"" (2004).

""Saw II"" is probably the series low point, with part III bringing it (presumably) to a breathtaking close. James Wan directed the first ""Saw,"" and Darren Lynn Bousman has been behind the camera for part II and part III. Leigh Whannell (Adam in the first ""Saw"") wrote the screenplay for this third entry.

Again like ""Saw II,"" the infamous Jigsaw Killer (the ever-creepy Tobin Bell) is out in the open, and so is his young apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith, who survived a reverse bear-trap device in ""Saw"" and whose true identity was revealed in ""Saw II""). This time, the terminally ill Jigsaw Killer has Amanda kidnap Doctor Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) to operate on the ailing killer. The twist is, Lynn has a bomb strapped to her head and in the event Jigsaw flat-lines or she's out of range, well, she won't be having anymore headaches.

Lynn's horror story is paralleled with the plight of the vengeance-stricken Jeff (Angus MacFayden), whose young son was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Jigsaw has set up a tricks & traps funhouse that Jeff must make his way out of in two hours and in the process, face the demons of his vengeance. And thus, let the games begin.

Of all the ""Saw"" movies, ""Saw III"" is the most reflective, often drawing on the past two films to advance its plot and wrap up shoddy details from those films. What I have always admired about the ""Saw"" films is the excellent writing. If at all, I would just like to praise Whannell for one heck of a story. But the only thing that detracts from the ""Saw"" movies is some of the haunted house elements and occasionally uneven writing.

Like ""Saw"" and ""Saw II,"" ""Saw III"" benefits from its tripped-out editing, trippy score, and cinematography. The tricks & traps scenarios the filmmakers present us with get nastier and more grisly with each movie. Tobin Bell has been the central figure of the last two movies and his creepy performance is likely to rank as some of the best work of a screen serial killer.

It will be amazing if a fourth film is ever made.

A bunch of obnoxious, spoiled kids with no talent get to judge whether or not their talent is ""zany"" or not... I mean c'mon, why are the judges a bunch of kids who can't even do any of the talents that are shown but somehow get to judge them if they were good enough or not.Another thing I hate about the show is awful jokes and the host is horrible, I can't believe he gets paid to make corny jokes. It baffles me why adults with real talent would go on this show to be judged by a bunch of kids, and not to mention the prize is only $1,000 which is paid in pennies (not sure if that is actually true but they claim it's in pennies) I mean why would people want to go on a show and be humiliated for a 1000 pennies?This is without a doubt the worst show I have ever seen in my life, nothing on planet earth could beat this show...",264,0,,0,No reference

1553,1141682,2006-02-26,Chris Knipp,Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine (2003),7.0,"In 1997 Kasparov, considered (according, that is, to this biased documentary), the greatest chess player in history, played a high profile match against an IMB supercomputer called Deep Blue devised for the sole purpose of not only playing world class chess but beating the greatest of grand masters -- in fact created specifically to beat Kasparov. The stakes were $700,000-$400,000, winner/loser. It can't be said that Deep Blue really beat Kasparov, who had beaten a simpler form of the computer several years earlier. What happened is that the second of the six games spooked Kasparov so much -- and he resigned, when later it was pointed out he might have achieved a draw -- that he never recovered psychologically, and by game six he was a psychological wreck, couldn't focus, and resigned, thereby losing the match.Surely Jayanti has a good subject: the human brain against artificial intelligence, the triumph of steely mindless machinery over brilliant, volatile intellectual genius. The filmmaker spoils his documentary by intruding too much with portentous music, gimmicky images of antique dolls, and by providing too little perspective outside the viewpoint of Kasparov himself, not even questioning the wild and unsubstantiated accusations that Kasparov throws out against IBM. There's still interest here, and so much at stake that it may be understandable that some (again wildly) have called this the best film about chess ever. Nonetheless that seems a bit of a misnomer given that there is so little specifically about chess and its moves -- though there is valuable and relevant information about the psychological pressures of great matches and the statistical complexity of the game itself.Kasparov's personality is lively and his English is good, but that is not enough in itself to counteract the gimmicky use of antique mechanical chess-playing dummies as a suggestive ""echo"" of the IMB mega-computer Deep Blue, the portentous music, the pseudo-spooky whispering voice-overs, and Jayanti's aforementioned refusal to challenge any claims Kasparov makes about the way things went or about his place in the history of world chess.Kasparov challenged Karpov in 1984-85 in a huge series of games, Armenian Jew against, as he saw it, the Soviet block -- a styling much favored (though the film does not note this obvious aspect) by Cold War attitudes in the United States -- and for his overall performance he had established himself as ""the greatest chess player in history."" (The many possible challenges to that claim are something the film doesn't go into for a moment.) In 1997 IBM, seeking to improve its stolid image against the livelier profiles of Microsoft and Apple, staged a hugely promoted New York six-game match between Kasparov and a newly improved and enlarged Deep Blue. They had six boffins lined up before and after each game, the chess and programming experts who were Deep Blue's handlers. Was that good strategy, lining up six grinning Asian and Caucasian nerds against one challenged Armenian Jew? Doubtful; and though at the end, IBM sternly directed its crew not to smile, that did little to offset its earlier displays of conspicuous nerdly smugness. IBM also maintained tight security around the emplacement of the large computer, and refused ever to release printouts of its operations to Kasparov. According to him, they promised to at the end, but never did.What happened is this: in game one, Deep Blue played like a machine, and Kasparov won easily. He thought that would continue. But in game two, he attempted a trick with pawns -- the film never goes into any detail about the actual chess moves and offers little of concrete interest to chess enthusiasts, but something that would normally lead a computer astray, into immediate profiting. But the machine didn't fall for it, and instead embarked on a mysterious and very humanoid-seeming grand strategy that put Kasparov in a very bad position. He was stunned. He overreacted, resigning as mentioned though later he realized he could have extracted a draw from the situation. From game two on, the champion became lastingly paranoid. And throughout the rest of the match, he never got over it. He suspected that some grand masters were assisting in deciding the moves of Deep Blue against him; and there were plenty of grand masters around, presumably in the employ of IBM. It's generally agreed, according to the film, that even a merely fine chess player, not necessarily world class, working together with a computer, could beat anybody. And that would not have been fair, and wasn't what was agreed upon. However, the film never provides a shred of evidence that IBM cheated in this way. All that's clear is that a machine doesn't lose its cool, and a human chess player very often does. Great a player as he is, Kasparov isn't cool. Someone remarks that he would make a terrible poker player, and in fact when things (in his view) are not going well, it is written all over his face and conspicuous in his body language. Kasparov, and Jayanti with his style, suggest that IBM's manipulations connect with Eighties YUPPIE thinking and corporate, Enron-style greed. But there is no proof of this. All that is clear is that IBM lacked finesse in its handling of the match, but profited much by it: stock went up in value 15% after this event. Where Kasparov is now isn't made very clear, but the film states that he is still playing and winning, against humans, and in 2003 tied in a match against the latest computer chess master, Deep Blue Junior, in Israel, and has met various challenges in recent years, been beaten, but still remains ""the greatest."" You can review Kasparov's chess history online at various sites. Kasparov is a great player. His role in world chess has been far more dubious than this documentary would have us believe. His full story, with all its pros and cons, has yet to be etched in celluloid.",986,0,,0,No reference

The tone, the editing, the cinematography, and the acting all come together so beautifully to make a near perfect film in the mystery crime drama.

It's 100% fatal once you're infected and it turns people to a somewhat fragile stone-like state in its last stage. In this cataclysmic scenario, a company proposes to put in cryogenic sleep a few hundred people at a Scotland castle facility until a cure is found. After some preparations and farewells, the chosen (I'm still not sure how they were selected) start hibernating. One girl wakes up after who knows how long, in the dark with no one else awake and with giant thorn vines everywhere. I'm not revealing anything that isn't in the trailer, in fact, I say less. A big part of the appeal of this movie is the gripping suspenseful story about a bunch of people trying to survive in an unknown and hostile closed-in environment (the castle) while trying to discover what happened not only to them but outside. It might seem like just a chase for a while (albeit a good one) but it turns out to be more complex and metaphysical. The grand mystery is even more fun because the nature of their reality is uncertain. The survivors were well characterized and I enjoyed them. I was afraid 2 characters looked too much the same at the start but it turns out they were identical twins (not a spoiler : I just didn't catch that early enough).""King of Thorn"" combines traditional animation for characters and 3d computer graphics for vehicles, most moving objects and certain creatures. They mix very well and seem to add depth to the proceedings. I think what helps is that the 3d objects seem to be drawn over or cell shaded most of the time so it's really not too jarring (far from Final Fantasy quality though). The characters are nicely drawn (yet traditional in style) and the action sequences are particularly exciting and dynamic with amazing direction. The decors are picturesque and/or sinister with of course lots of thorn vines everywhere. There's also a nice contrast between medieval castle (almost fantasy) look and sci-fi trappings. I would like to point out one of the last creatures seen (a gigantic green one) that was quite grandiose yet weirdly beautiful (perhaps more so because I did see this in a theater). This film has a nightmarish Sleeping Beauty castle aesthetic and that fairy tale is important story-wise. It also has a strong video-game influence in terms of structure and creatures as the young boy accompanying the group keeps reminding us. His enthusiasm is also responsible for the few smiles in an otherwise dark adventure. I haven't watched a ton of animes (especially the recent ones) but considering my elated reaction, it might deserve to become a new classic. Rating : 8.5 out of 10",479,0,,0,No reference
1567,1542567,2007-11-19,Steffi_P,Raging Bull (1980),9.0,"Raging Bull, perhaps Martin Scorsese's first fully mature film, sees him taking on a similar task to that of Orson Welles when he made Citizen Kane  that is, to take a very public figure and strip away the layers of myth, hype and stereotyping to reveal the human being. In this case, Scorsese set himself the great challenge of creating something poignant and lyrical out of the harsh and violent life of a professional boxer.As with Citizen Kane (and Lawrence of Arabia, and many other great biopics), Scorsese begins his story with the end result  what La Motta eventually became  then resets to the beginning of his career, and eventually coming full circle. It was probably with this picture Scorsese discovered his forte for the biopic or real-life picture. It's not generally acknowledged, but round about half of Scorsese's features after Raging Bull would either be biographies or at least based upon real events and characters. It was this goal of telling an unknown story and revealing the real person that drove these pictures, and it began here with Raging Bull.As I said, the job was particularly difficult here  it's not easy to create a sympathetic portrait of a paranoid, short-tempered, misogynist brute, but Scorsese appears to have managed it, perhaps more through technique than anything else. First of all, this is Scorsese at his most subjective. There are numerous point-of-view shots, but they are not just there to show what a character is looking at. Scorsese uses his own blend of expressionist techniques  slow motion, blocking out parts of the sound track and emphasising others  to show state of mind. A good example is La Motta's predatory ogling of Vicky the first time he lays eyes on her. Many of these techniques he perfected in Taxi Driver, but equally important in his development up to this point is 1977's New York New York, the most overlooked of Scorsese's pictures. In New York New York Scorsese became more adept with the musical elements of his films  you can see that from opening credits, where he slows down De Niro's aggressive posturing to fit the music until it comes to resemble ballet more than boxing. New York New York gave Scorsese more confidence in telling a story that spans several years, and how to make transitions that convey that passage of time.Of course the fight scenes are the heart of Raging Bull, and they are real tour-de-forces of technique. Scorsese's policy of keeping the camera in the ring and thus keeping the audience inside the experience of the fight was probably in part influenced by Hitchcock's silent boxing drama The Ring (1928), but I'm also very much reminded of a very different film, The Red Shoes. The Red Shoes, one of Scorsese's favourite films, features an extended ballet sequence in which the camera is inside the performance on the stage, and it is has that similar effect of putting us in the performers shoes. Having said all that, probably the greatest contributor to the Raging Bull fights was editor Thelma Schoonmaker (who coincidentally later married Red Shoes director Michael Powell), since its that editing  not just of the fighters but split second flashes of spectators, cameras and the bell  that has the most impact here. Schoonmaker rightly won an Oscar for her efforts.As for the actors, well, for my money Robert De Niro is not a great actor, merely a good one. To be honest I think he mostly attracts attention by the lengths he goes to in preparation for a role, learning professional boxing and getting fat on pasta for Raging Bull being perhaps the most extreme example. More interesting here is the discovery of Joe Pesci. He's one of the few really great character actors of modern cinema, and everything a character actor should be. Cathy Moriarty is also very good as Vicky, and it's a mystery to me why she more or less disappeared as a major actor after this.Raging Bull is an impressive film, one of the later landmarks of the biopic genre, as well being the last word on boxing movies (although sadly they went on making Rocky sequels all the same). It also revitalised Scorsese's career and launched those of several previously unknown actors. It's not the most watchable of Scorsese's pictures but is one of his most significant.",733,0,,0,No reference

Ben affleck in this movie is at his average. altogether gone girl is an amazing drama mystery movie with some really good acting and music and is a fun watch. it wouldn't let you down at any moment and you get what you expected.

1573,2545231,2013-10-18,aquastar36,Pride & Prejudice (2005),10.0,"The 2005 British romance movie, Pride and Prejudice is based on Jane Austen's novel about five sisters in Georgian England. Keira Knightly stars as the main character, Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew MacFadyen plays her romantic interest. The story follows the second oldest of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth, as she encounters issues of manners, morality, and marriage in the early 19th-century England society.Pride and Prejudice is about the Bennet sisters finding suitable gentleman to marry and living their lives in Georgian England. Mr Bennet, an English gentleman and his overbearing wife continually look for suitable husbands for their five daughters. When Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Bennet, a spirited young woman and a single, wealthy Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) meet for the first time, a connection is made even though she swears that he is the last person on earth that she'll ever marry. Their fate become intertwined in a journey that they never expected.I really liked the acting in the movie. I think the Bennet family interactions made the whole film more interesting to watch because in Jane Austen's novel, the characters seemed flat to me. Keira Knightly did a wonderful job portraying Lizzy because she is headstrong, stubborn, and graceful as well. Matthew MacFadyen really brought out Mr. Darcy's aloofness and his rigid manners. We can see a physical chemistry between the two characters when they touch hands and their eyes interlock.This film makes the audience voyeurs. The story begins with the opening shot of Elizabeth walking home reading what is assumed to be Austen's First Impressions. It is like a story within a story. The viewers also look over her shoulder to see her turning the page. Through the camera's lens, we follow her into her home and through the rooms. The audience also sees characters through the windows, eavesdrop on them through doors, and stand behind them during conversations. It gives the film another layer to depth and transports the viewers into the story. The director, Joe Wright, uses a variety of camera angles and shots to portray Darcy and Elizabeth's chemistry and eventual love. One of the amazing shots that we see is when Elizabeth faces the mirror after turning down Darcy's proposal and the passage of time can be seen by the techniques involving the soft and dark lighting. The viewers can gain an insight of Elizabeth's internal confusion by the use of blurred long shots, close ups of the characters and the letter that Darcy writes to Elizabeth after their argument. After Elizabeth realizes that she has misjudged Darcy, her best friend, Charlotte (Claudie Blakley), comes into the room and asks if she is alright. Elizabeth responds with, ""I hardy know."" It leaves the audience questioning what she meant by that response.The background music and the setting was a very important aspect during the powerful moments in the film. *SPOILER* When Mr. Darcy was coming toward Elizabeth in the misty field at dawn, I was moved by that scene because they were finally together and what Mr. Darcy's aunt tried to do actually confirmed their feeling for one another.I really enjoyed this film and I have watch it many times. It never fails to emotionally move me. It is a beautiful movie filled with beautiful scenes, intense moments, and love. It is my favorite movie and if you are a fan of romance, then I highly recommend it!",561,0,,0,No reference

Despite the outrageous occurrences, the multiple post-its left behind, the orientation 'team-work' speech, the suspiciously new buddies showing up on top of each other, badge in/badge out or the single fax machine hogger, it's pretty dead-on. Anyone that hasn't worked in the environment, take note: that's not just day one. The mid-section alters the story with strange details of 'New Guy' – Simon Pegg's lost twin, getting locked in and left behind overnight.

Kara (cute-as-a-button 19 year old Helen Slater, in her starring film debut) arrives on Earth in search of a powerful device called the Omegahedron. Unfortunately, it has already fallen into the clutches of the worst possible recipient: Selena (a highly theatrical Faye Dunaway, back in ""Mommie Dearest"" mode), a witch with grandiose plans for world domination.""Supergirl"" is certainly not without its faults. Overly silly and dumb at first, it suffers from a pretty bad script. Only in its second half (this viewer watched the international cut, running two hours & five minutes) does it start coming to life, as Selenas' powers start becoming much more impressive. The script also finally starts managing some interesting wrinkles in how it plays out.The special and visual effects are generally pretty good, as the filmmakers attempt to give you a lot of razzle-dazzle and spectacle. They also offer quite a bit of dopey humour, as Selena tries to snare a hunky lunkhead gardener (handsome Hart Bochner, who's best known as the sleazy Ellis in ""Die Hard"") who falls in love with Supergirl instead.Slater definitely looks great in the costume, but is also effective in the sense of how she conveys an essential innocence and desire to do good. Dunaway is so campy as to be outright goofy; adding sass is the under-rated Brenda Vaccaro as her sidekick. Marc McClure once again plays Jimmy Olsen, who romances Lucy Lane (younger sister of Lois), portrayed by Maureen Teefy. Peter O'Toole is essentially just picking up a pay check as genial wizard Zaltar; Mia Farrow and Simon Ward play Karas' parents, in quick cameo roles. Peter Cook is a hoot as Nigel, Selenas' former cohort whom she soon kicks to the curb. A young Matt Frewer, in one of his earliest movie roles, plays a lecherous truck driver who soon receives some comeuppance.Overall, this is not a patch on the first two Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" films, but it's watchable, with a majestic score by Jerry Goldsmith.

Throughout this film, the taxi is the center of the film, and the camera often focused on up-close shots of the taxi, and allowed the rest of the surrounding area to drift by, similar to how Travis Bickle feels within the film. Most of the shots in this film are slow, ironic because the life of a taxi driver is quick. The deliberate shots emphasize the loneliness felt by Bickle, and his separation from society.

Halloween (78) was the first real horror movie I watched in the theater and one of the very few horror movies to give me ass clenching terror so it holds a special place in my heart above it's status as a classic. But, eventually I had to see the new for myself. Overall the movie has some very positive things going for it. The casting was very good, many fan favored faces and some good solid acting and direction. The new Michael was very creepy, that white mask gave him something of an unreal look like a human body with the head of a Greek sculpture stuck on top. Tyler Mane would be imposing even with a happy rabbit's mask, here he is downright terrifying. Begrudgingly I have to admit that Tyler's Michael was a scary sonofabitch. Zombie's Michael on the other hand wasn't very scary. The whole back story portraying Michael as a victim just didn't work for me and it almost seemed like Zombie couldn't really stick with it himself as he struggled to show this ugly, girly, little boy as victim become evil, psychopathic bogeyman. I liked that Michael was absolutely remorseless, even killing his caretaker of almost twenty years. I didn't like Michael's ambiguous motivations for kidnapping his sister as I wasn't sure if Michael's behavior near the end was the result of his desire to see his little sister again or if Zombie had just run out of ideas for getting the knife to Laurie. The unrated version is overlong or maybe both versions are overlong. Zombie spent way too much time on young Michael and by the time we return to Haddonfield, I was bored. I stayed bored until Loomis and Laurie finally meet up but the end was near by then anyway. Really I think Zombie had some terrific ideas and he really shows promise as a horror director but it's unfortunate that he took on this remake as his ideas would have made a better movie without begging comparisons to the classic.",379,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

From an artistic point of view it is not on the same level. I found it difficult to recognize the organizing, guiding hand of the director. Also, the subject is strangely out of focus  but that is maybe just one of the points the movie wants to make. Maître Vergès must be a pretty elusive fellow and certainly not someone who let himself manipulate by a movie maker. And - contrary to Amin and the gorilla - Vergès is just not very telegenic. That's certainly nobody's fault, it's just a fact.What remains for me are the many bonmots"" this movie contains. It did not become clear to me if Vergès ever was a good lawyer. I suspect he always saw the court of law principally as a stage for making political statements or for furthering a certain self image. But he certainly is a great story teller. My only war wound"", he tells the interviewer, was self inflicted  I cut a finger when I closed my pocket knife after eating a dish of oysters"". Mao listened to me attentively  or maybe he just wanted to be polite."" It is fun to listen to him telling these anecdotes and being disrespectful, even to himself. Many, maybe too many other people make their entrance as interviewees. Even for someone who has a notion of the last few decades of world history it is not always easy to follow.Saying all this, I have to credit the movie for forming a pattern of statements, places and time periods that recount events which brought a lot of pain and sorrow to this planet. The central question - is Maître Vergès a man with a cause? - remains unanswered. Somehow he shifted from one liberation movement"" to the next, maybe connected to secret services, maybe not - his aims apparently as fuzzy as those of the said movements - never drowning like others but always ending up seemingly comfortably on the surface. It is never clear how much Vergès was a prime mover on the terrorist scene or a teleguided pawn. After seeing this movie I would liken him to a joker in a pack of cards.Someone not very deep into history might be surprised at how L'avocat shows that there were always connections and sympathies between old, active Nazis and young, seemingly leftist revolutionaries.

This episode shows what happened at the ranch when they were out making a deal to save their people, and the events that follows are amazing, seriously some great drama. The episode begins with Troy, one of sons of the now deceased Jeremiah Sr, Troy is exiled and for me he's an interesting enough character and a great actor that could hold his own episode, but this episode has all the characters who lives in the Ranch.Alrick Riley directed this episode and he sure is talented, the camera work is great and the shots are beautiful. Take the camera work and mix that with the beautiful scenery makes for some memorable shots. Cinematography was amazing. The musical score is as always suspenseful and fitting to the show, I just came to a realization that I believe that the sound editing is actually the best of any of the TWD shows, I might be wrong but it's amazing and everything sounds realistic. There were bunch of action, zombies and suspenseful moments in this movie. The horde is upon them and I want to add from a storytelling perspective, it's realistic that the horse is coming as there have been so much gunfire and other loud noises near that ranch.The supporting cast and characters get more screen time in this episode, which ultimately gives more life to the community at the ranch. Crazy Dog is the supporting character that really shines throughout the episode as Walker isn't there and it is always fun to see supporting actors get more screen time and be able to give great performances.
Alycia Debnam-Carey, Frank Dillane, Daniel Sharman and Sam Underwood were all great in this episode, really giving their all into the role of their respective characters. This is also the episode that made Alicia become my favorite character of the whole show, as she is a bad ass and super likeable.Now for the spoiler part of my review, Troy. All the bad things that happens in this episode is him, indirectly. He's the true villain of this season, but it's also sad because he's a broken person, a man that never really got the help he needed. So all hell breaks loose, and Nick does something stupid but I can't blame him he have grown fond of Troy and sees him like a brother so of course he would defend him from Jake, but he died. He got bit and bled out after they chopped his arm off. This is some incredible writing and storytelling as the consequences this will have, Alicia lost another person she loved which was indirectly caused by her own brother.

I rewatched it though and was surprised and how much better I liked it this time.  Perhaps due to lower expectations.  Anyway, on the the ""sequel.""Only 1 character from Mimic is here, Miro Sorvino's partner Remy.  In Mimic she disappears about half way through, her job in the plot done.  Here she carries the movie and does a decent job of taking her 10 minutes of screen time in the first film and giving her more here.  Her use of her camera here is a nice continuity touch.  Other characters are generally disposable (and nearly all of them are disposed of).No creative people return and yet the style and tone are very reminscent of the first film.  The plot is mostly rehash of the first movie with a group of people trapped in a confined space with human sized mutant cockroaches. Of course, the style and look of the first film were mostly borrowed from Species and the Alien series (particularly Alien 3) so this one follows suit.This time, an undeveloped plot about the military (basically replacing the CDC of the first film) is introduced but not fleshed out.  Given the film's extra short 82 minute run time, more certainly could have been added.  This almost seemed more like an unused idea for the first film rather than a seperate plot line of it's own.The science here is weak (and accounts for the one glaring continuity error when Remy explains what DNA went into the Judas breed) but the plot doesn't hinge on science.  It's a giant bug movie.  My expectations of credible science are minimal.None of the characters behave in the typical ultra-stupid ""I'm in a horror movie so I'm not gonna scream for help but instead hide until I get eaten"" manner which helps.

And that would have crushed the movie. She was a great actor. On a lot of these movies the female part is honestly too much. I guess e live in a world where in movies they know they have a female audience and don't want to upset them. They weren't worried about it in this movie. This girl had sarcasm and she was great plus not everything went her way. She added to the movie not with some stereotypical bs. This is my favorite movie by John Travolta. I guess I'm bias but he puts on a great performance. Hes the god guy but honestly it seems like hes the bad guy. Rogue does what he wants and simply doesn't care who hes talking to. He even told the police ""shouldn't you be out night sticking colored people"". The kind of language honestly you wont see in other movies. The sarcasm is through the roof. Even the female detective still puts her spice on things and tricks the guy with panties she bought at a store and then throws away. She sold that scene.Nor did the director make her out to be some beautiful unwitty girl that made you want to puke. The Generals Daughter was beautiful. And even her character surprised you with her actions. This is a movie I can watch over and over cause 1 The acting is great 2. Because it has a plot with a bunch of twist 3. Its just some great acting 4. And most important of them all its great lines and very good language.",391,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

Unlike other movies of this genre, the pace is kinda slow, which is appropriate for the story. When you build a time travel machine, it is normal that it takes multiple attempts before it works. Even though sometimes you may wonder why the characters are still filming their journey, it's not disturbing enough to prevent you from focusing on the plot, which is a good thing. There's also a good love story and some funny moments, in addition to a breath taking last act. I'd compare it to the Canadian movie Chronicles.

One day I ran into this rare, underestimated gem of a movie at the video store, since it starred Thora I decided to rent it.When I popped it in I just couldn't stop watching.  Not once did I excuse myself for snacks or bathroom breaks, like I always do whenever a film starts to get boring.  I loved the artistic direction and the great acting. I just dig those posh British accents!  The Hole is one of the finer thrillers of 2001.  Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, it throws you a curb.  It's about a group of private-school teenagers who secretly uncover an old, World War 2 hole and decide to explore it. They accidentally get stuck when something goes wrong and the four friends are deprived of water, food and air.  Liz's escape from the hole is the backbone of the story, it keeps on showing flashbacks of the event itself. Liz casts her mind back two weeks to when she was an innocent schoolgirl with a mad crush on Mike ,the son of an American rock star and the coolest guy on the planet. Not that he'd notice her, of course, with her mousy brown hair, unsophisticated clothes and uncool image. She would do absolutely anything to get his attention. It's Martin who makes everything happen. Martin -- the school weirdo, an introverted computer whiz who is as in love with Liz as she's in love with Mike. Whatever Liz wants, Martin will get, no matter what the cost to him emotionally. And it so happens that he's arranged for Mike, Mike's best friend Geoff  and Frankie, the queen of the girls' dorm, to escape the boring end-of-term geography field trip and spend three days hiding out in a secret underground bunker. He will arrange for Liz to join the party. For Liz, it's a dream come true -- three days with the coolest kids in school, handsome jock Geoff, beautiful Frankie and charming Mike, her soul mate, her Prince Charming, the man she's meant to be with.When Liz finishes her story, it's obvious to Philippa that the girl before her is deeply traumatized, unable to face up to the horrible reality of her friends' deaths. The police, meanwhile, have arrested Martin. In the interrogation room, he's aloof and arrogant.As he begins his version of events, a terrible truth begins to emerge, a truth that will expose the full horror of an obsessive love, a love that will stop at nothing to be fulfilled...
I was expecting your average teen horror story, like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Freddy vs Jason.  In a way it's disturbing, but it's got moving and powerful moments as well.The acting was very good in this film.  I enjoyed Keira Knightley playing a different role.  Sure she is kind of bubbly for some of the movie, but she was also the caring & careless queen bee for the rest of the movie. It was great to see her show some emotions. Desmond Harrington was also good as Mike, Liz's obsession, the normal boy with famous parents.  Embeth Davitz plays the psychologist working with the police, who is determined to find the answer to what happened to Liz. The downside to her character was she wasn't in the film as much as I would have liked to see her in it since she's such a wonderful actress but while she was in the film, she played her character very well. Daniel Brocklebank plays the school weirdo, an obsessed computer whiz who is as much in love with Liz as she's in love with Mike and he played his character well, even though at times I doubt he played the role since it seemed like the perfect role for him. As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they were probably the finest I have seen in British movies.The script was great!  Ben Court is a pretty good script writer, considering it was his first try.  I enjoyed the movie a lot as I am sure you have already picked up from my review so far. I liked the script because it showed how real pain, jealousy and forbidden passion can be.  It was a nice movie which showed the teenagers going from spoiled and rich to dirty and surviving on their own.  It was nice to see a script that mixed both comedic and dramatic moments so perfectly. I would like to say good job Ben Court I applaud your work on this script, keep it up. The director, Nick Hamm, did a great job on directing the movie. He knew how to put the movie together. I was surprised Nick Hamm did such a great job on this film since his last films were the mildly enjoyable Talking to Angels and the awful Harmfulness of Tobacco. It's amazing that he too was able to catch the emotions that were in the movie. The movie portrays the average teens but in today's world I guess we can say the not so average teens and how life is for them in the hole. It's a very moving movie as I already mentioned above and the director really caught all the difficulties and good moments in the time they were stuck in it l.So in conclusion, The Hole was everything I hoped it to be. It was better than I expected it to be and touched me very much.   I can relate to the movie in some sense.  I think that's why I really got emotional at the end of the film and cried because it's sad but it's not really that sad that someone should cry at the end. I liked the movie a lot. It was very good and thrilling.    I cannot see anyone turning it off this film saying its bad. It's a film, which I think almost anyone can enjoy. It's not full of stupidity but has on-the-edge-of-your-seat moments.  It has some comedy, which is always good in a film as well. To me the film is the perfect British teen drama/thriller/mystery. I give The Hole a very high rating of a 9/10.",1054,0,,0,No reference

James Remar is positively electric in this--he seems honestly dangerous. When I looked him up after seeing him in this, I was surprised he never got top-billing in anything. He makes an incredible villain.The twist ending is amazing, but after some thinking it seems more complicated. Here is the ending: Ron takes a family hostage, attempts to rape the teenaged daughter and ends up killing all of them. This pushes Jimmy to kill Ron. We learn later that Jimmy hallucinated the family (they were only mannequins).My questions are as follows: Doesn't it seem kind of sick that Jimmy needed to imagine a girl raped and an entire family killed to ""push himself"" to finally kill Ron? Seems like an awfully elaborate dream for the good guy to have.It also occurred to me that perhaps the family AND Ron's final death are hallucinations---maybe Jimmy accidentally killed Ron the first time they were struggling with the gun, and he (Jimmy) proceeded to hallucinate the family situation to justify Ron's accidental death. We do hear a gunshot during that initial struggle. In fact, it is that gunshot that ""wakes up"" little Billy and the rest of the family.Anyway, it's a suspenseful episode that can be enjoyed as-is or as a thought-provoker.",216,0,,0,No reference

The film combines two stories: one of the father and his ability to deal with his wife's death while making sense of the alien invasion through the eyes of his religion. The other story is more science-fiction in nature with people hiding in horror as they try to overcome the aliens and protect themselves. The film has some lessons to learn and settles the story in a way that encompasses both plots together nicely. The family-life plot was a little too slow moving for me, and it felt forced and silly/patriotic/sympathetic. It humanized the main character too much, and it distracted from the science-fiction part of the film. Special effects were also done well and were believable.

After all, isn't a comedy supposed to have some laughs? Well, this one didn't and sure could have used an infusion of humor. Now this is not to say it's a terrible film, but inserting a gimmicky 'funny' race at the end just was too little too late for the humor department.The film begins with Dean playing his usual sort of role--a heal. He is in debt to gamblers who are ready to beat him senseless (or worse) but decide to give him one more chance. If he agrees to fix an upcoming horse race, they'll not beat him half to death! So, having little choice, he decides to enlist the help of his spastic cousin (Jerry). However, Jerry really is just a nice animal lover and wants nothing to do with Dean's dirty tricks. Why Jerry eventually agrees to help him seemed a bit confusing, but help him he did. Along the way, both meet pretty ladies and fall in love. Eventually, Jerry poses (badly) as an English rider--but near the end of the film, the mob and Dean's new girlfriend learn of this and the two guys will be lucky to get out of this alive.The film is pleasant but not funny.

Her husband, who has just been released from prison, has become the target of an unknown killer, so his nephew asks Kris, who is the spitting image of the late Rosemary, to come to the family mansion and find out what's going on. But Rosemary's husband seems to still be stuck in the 1930s, and separating the past from the present is becoming increasingly hard for him.

1604,1593931,2008-02-24,miloc,Gwoemul (2006),8.0,"Joon-ho Bong, the director and co-writer of this marvelous satirical monster movie, clearly loves the conventions of the sci-fi/horror genre; he also clearly loves smashing them. A family gathers in an evacuation center to mourn a lost child; astonishingly, and discomfitingly, their grief goes over-the-top into parody -- you start to giggle and feel guilty, and then, realizing the humor is intentional, keep on giggling. A moment later, an ominous figure enters wearing a bio-protection suit, and you barely have time to feel nervous before he takes a pratfall. It's the kind of irreverence that may worry the conscientious western audience.But Joon-ho is less worried about taking the genre seriously than he is making a rousingly entertaining movie. After a brisk bit of backstory he brings us to a sunny day on Seoul's Han river, where a dimwitted father (Kang-ho Song) and his sweet, smart daughter (Ah-sung Ko) help to run a food stand. Some onlookers notice a curious, indistinctly seen creature drop from a nearby bridge and swim through the water. Within a few moments that creature will be seen very clearly indeed, in a sequence both startling and exhilarating; there's none of this ""Cloverfield"" coyness about what-does-it-really-look-like. Few directors in this field are so generous with their monster, and the special effects, presented quite matter-of-factly, in broad daylight as it were, do not disappoint.Joon-ho's head-on approach is bracing -- he pushes the gas-pedal so strongly that you almost fail to notice how complex the story is that follows. There are satiric swipes at the U.S., with more than a hint of Iraq in the aftertaste, and also a nice allegorical fable about unity in the face of danger. While the family that the film centers upon bicker and argue, they remain comic and ineffectual. Their eventual cooperation in the face of crisis pulls them through. (The message is reminiscent of Kurosawa, whose sharpest jabs were at selfishness and egocentrism.)The monster is a hoot. (Watch out for that tail!) The performances are smart and often poignant, especially the young actress Ah-sung Ko, as a resourceful child in great peril. And, without giving too much away, the film has at least one magnificently scary moment, when Hyun-Seo (Ko), leaps to catch hold of a rope -- she clutches it, dangling for a moment, then lets go -- and then we, like she, are held breathless, in suspension. Truly first-rate.Highly recommended, especially before the planned American remake comes out. Now that, unfortunately, is something to fear....",415,0,,0,No reference

Schenck, Buster Keaton regarded Seven Chances as his least favourite of his films, so much so that he tried to prevent a restoration from the one known copy. This is all considerably surprising and perhaps indicative of the professionalism the former vaudeville daredevil regarded his film work with, that despite his personal disaffection for the project, Buster Keaton turned it into a bonafide classic so very representative of his work. The basic story of a young man who must get married by seven o'clock that afternoon in order to inherit a vast fortune left to him by his deceased grandfather, becomes a setup, as Keaton tries his luck proposing to ""anything that wears a skirt, including a Scotchman"", for a huge uproarious chase scene in the second half on roads, mountains, land and water.

I'm surprised Ryan Reynolds is in this considering that he mocked the typical superheroes trope in his film Deadpool. Here, the clichés are derivative and hackneyed. Here is one, the captain of the crew is outside the space station with the creature attached to her and she knows she's going to die. So instead of pushing herself off and away from the space station where it can't do anymore harm, she lingers close to it where the creature slowly kills her and then her body floats away and the creature comfortably launches off her body and back to the space station.And here is the atypical trope that's been worked to death in movies kike this, you have the scientist fiddling around with an alien organism where he names it and plays with it like it's a cute doll. But like all things small, it grows and it grows big. So why do we keep seeing the same thing over and over again? Is this the sci-fi rule where a scientist rule to treat alien spawns like Muppet babies that will one day grow up and eat your face off? Watching this was so frustrating. You can understand why people talk back to the screen because idiots make movies.And here is another typical trope, the crew gets killed off one by one. We've seen this before in films like Aliens. And then there is the lone survivor. They make it so that it ends a certain way in order for you to want a sequel. I don't want a sequel, I want it to end. Don't do this again. That little mind play at the end with both capsules floating around in space only to discover that the one without the creature is hurtling off into space and the one with the creature is entering earth's atmosphere, not that surprising. And why does the communication fails in these scenarios? You'd think that the communication devices were made by three year old's. And with all of the so-called experience this crew had, hadn't any of them seen a sci-fi movie where things like this happens with regularity? And why would the capsule land in a part of the ocean where the fishermen could see that there was something on the guy and yet they still open the capsule and he was screaming at the top of his lungs, NO!?

It is pure magic for Dreamworks (who also did Shrek) to amaze us with such technology. It's not that Pixar is any better in computer animation, but the computer anime in Antz just doesn't live up to the astonishing animation of that of Pixar.I have to say though, maybe Antz had better vocal talents and famous actors to voice there characters, while all A Bug's Life had was Kevin Spacey. I don't think that makes the film any worse or better, but it certainly had better vocal talents.There isn't much to say about Antz, I enjoyed the film, but I had too high of expectations for it, and it let me down.

Like all period movies, the actors constantly have to struggle to surmount the weird hairdos--none succeed. Jennifer Lawrence was ATROCIOUS, too broad, like a parody. Neither the Amy Adams character nor the Christian Bale character were remotely sympathetic. I guess we were supposed to get caught up in their love story (?) or feel sorry that Bale has a heart condition (who cares?) The movie uses too much voice-over in the first half hour, which is always the sign of lazy storytelling. Even when the voice-over disappears the storytelling doesn't pick up.

The movie is somewhat mysterious and doesn't make much sense until the end, however the ending became more predictable as the movie went along.I've got some gripes though. So if the main protagonist was actually the underground version, and the underground version was the real protagonist, why did the real version have a messed up voice? I don't know. How did the underground version manage to become a normal person? I don't know. Why did the real version decide to hold a massive nation-wide uprising, and what was the end goal other than revenge with massive collateral damage against millions of innocent people? I don't know.These questions, the last one in particular, took me out of the movie.

It's simple premise is that of the friendship between a kind hearted old man and a little girl who he plays with along with the other children in the neighbourhood. The hook in this tale which draws you is in when the elderly gent is forced to confess a special secret to his pint sized friend. He is in fact an alien who's on the run from agents from his home planet and they've caught up with him. Notable for a guest appearance from Nancy Kulp. An actress best known for her career defining role as Miss Hathway in the brilliant TV sitcom ""The Beverly Hillbillies"". Miss Kulp plays the little girls mean tempered Aunt and guardian who is a far cry from the more prim and proper(yet likable) character who audiences the world over came to love. She still manages however to embody the role with surly effectiveness. As Old Ben, the grandfatherly figure J. Pat O' Malley is wonderfully charming and endearing. So much so that you warm to him immensely as you do with his then younger co- star Susan Gordon. A child actress who manages to be equal parts sweet and naively innocent without descending in to too much gooienss.Some have accused the episode of being too sickly sweet but personally I find it to be a harmless, cute little romp. That said I wouldn't rate it as one of the best additions to Serlings classic series. It's never the less a fun outing with a playful twist at the end which is rounded up by another to the tale. The tagged on coda however might have been a bit unnecessary given the grandfather/granddaughter relationship of the pair. But It's probably still the closest the series got to a fairy tale episode.

They met her late in the second season (Episode 21 - Arrivederci, Baby).Leading their expedition to find lost pirate treasure is world famous adventurer Angelo Guilirini (Cesar Romero) - Giovanna's father and captain of his own boat - the Arrivederci (All introduced on Season 2, Episode 21). The expedition has been fraught with sabotage which is suspected to have been orchestrated by alcoholic rival Captain Jack Schofield (Christopher Cary) and his decrepit wreck of a boat the Forty Fathoms.When Cody, Murray and Nick confront Schofield he does not deny he wants the treasure but does deny he has committed any act of sabotage. He proposes they work together after showing them parts of the treasure he has found. They have the man-power and the technology but after ten years head start on them he knows where it might be. The uneasy partnership is tested when the sabotage continues. Unbeknownst to them an evil businessman and an icy German fence (Christoper Neame) are trailing them in hopes of stealing the treasure out from under them.Amidst the treasure hunt story-line the cast also enact fantasy sequences which depict the Pirate & the Princess legend (Similar to the Highwayman poem) which is tied to the treasure. Perry King (Channeling Errol Flynn) portrays Captain William Tyson - the pirate. Ava Lazar portrays the princess he captures. Joe Penny (Channeling Cary Grant) portrays the first mate. Stylistically it conveys a classic cinema/women's romance novel vibe.The inference we are meant to draw is that the show is a modern take on swashbuckling adventure. The characters have that Peter Pan quality which invites the comparison already anyway.Gorgeous leading lady Ava Lazar was more than passable in her dual role. But she is the only female character we see. On a show that already featured himbos Cody and Nick they added a couple of guest himbo characters portrayed by Paul Land (As Guido) and Russell Todd (As Tony) respectively. They could have made both female and cast gorgeous actresses but didn't. For that and other reasons (Hokey writing mainly) this is not a personal favorite.As an implicit appeal to female viewers the detectives spend a significant part of a scene at the end talking about how to best be considerate of Giovanna who is heartbroken over a personal betrayal.Fans of the show Lost might pick up on a line of dialogue Nick says i.e. ""I've never heard of ghosts haunting an entire island before.""",465,0,,0,No reference

The music wasn't great either, but Chemical Brothers are probably just not my preferred choice in general, even if they have songs I like. Still, an interesting idea here as, in real life, a song by this band would be something that nobody like Coppola in this video would choose to present their talent. Why not?

However, what we got was the story of Nicholas Cage's character.  We only saw Ben Yahzee and Charlie Whitehorse through the eyes of men who seemingly didn't really understand them . . . often characters took a mocking ""let's hate the injuns"" attitude to their compatriots.I think this movie would have been a lot better and more interesting to viewers, had it taken the perspective of Yahzee, which could have given Woo the chance to give the Navajos the kind of tribute they really deserved. In the end, this turned into a cliche ridden gore festival, which in the end left me feeling cold.  Where ""Saving Private Ryan"" featured a chilling portrayal of wartime violence that was artistic and haunting, ""Windtalkers"" was almost glorification of violence . . . in some scenes, Cage almost seems to relish his ability to slaughter the Japanese, while in other scenes, we are given brutally unnecessary views of violence that seemed almost simply for violence's sake.  (Watch that scene with the decapitation, or the scene where Cage slits the throat of the man about to kill Yahzee and tell me those were necessary).My final verdict:  5/10.

This movie is ""perfect"" in each of these fields. The entire cast is fantastic, but Ellen Burstyn is extraordinary, giving the performance of her life.

At that age I wasn't as rebellious and wild as Max is, but I did conjure up worlds of my own in which I would create an entire land with characters. Spike Jonze's ambition adaptation of this long-loved children's tale was ambitious to say the least, but he pulled it off perfectly. From the opening scene I was completely drawn in to Max's world, and I never wanted to leave. Everything about this movie is brilliant, from the amazing soundtrack, the creature effects, the acting (and voice-acting), and the camera-work. Jonze and David Egger's screenplay takes the basic story and expands it into a film about childhood, which funnily enough I would not recommend to children. It is dark, slow, and I believe most children may not understand the movie's message.Eggers and Jonze add so much depth to the tale, creating a world and life for Max (Max Records) to take for granted. His father is out of the picture, his whereabouts unknown whilst his mother (Catherine Keener), is busy supporting the family, and his sister is at the age where acting cool for her friends removes any bond with a lonely and tossed aside brother. Loneliness is a huge theme here, and we all face it, even when surrounded by people we live with and cherish. To be able to accept others, one must always be able to accept oneself. I will stop here, as going into all the plot details, and all the different emotions that are experienced and overcome will basically be detailing the movie scene by scene.The creature's: Carol (James Gandolfini), Alexander (Paul Dano), Judith (Catherine O'Hara), Ira (Forest Whitaker), The Bull (Michael Berry Jr.), KW (Lauren Ambrose), and Douglas (Chris Cooper) represent different parts of Max's (Max Records) personality. Each have their own personalities, and each are marvelously brought to life by an incredibly talented team of artists.This is one of the year's best films, it is a charming, poignant piece of art, and Jonze has done justice to his source. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a film for kids, this is something adults will get the most enjoyment from. A solid 5/5",421,0,,1,Reference to other reviews

Well, fortunately the film was very entertaining and somewhat different (is it me, or are the characters just a little more wet in this one).The common problem with sequels is that they try to outdo the first one. This is why I still like the first one better, since it felt like a smaller movie. Regardless, I definitely enjoyed the slapstick humour of the first third mainly because they didn't make such a big deal out of it. Just give the people what they want to see in an action film. Funny/crazy stunts.Constant references to the previous film were okay and I was truly surprised at the amount of characters that came back for this film. The ending was a particularly nice surprise. In all the films only weakness is the fact that there is so much going on it makes the film feel rather long and the plot rather messy. Regardless we get to the end and enjoy it.Not quite as good as its predecessor but a good film none the less.",200,0,,0,No reference

The mother refuses to accept this and stays up all night wishing over and over that her son return home. Which he does, but not like she hoped. He's very weird and says next to nothing. Soon there are murders happening in their small town with people drained of blood.Cool low-budget horror movie from Bob Clark. It's a variation on the Monkey's Paw story -- ""Be careful what you wish for."" The cast is pretty good, particularly the actors playing the parents, John Marley and Lynn Carlin. Richard Backus plays the son and was apparently cast for his creepy stare, which he uses to great effect throughout the film. Chilling at times with a great atmosphere throughout, thanks in large part to the budgetary limitations. Low-budget '70s horror films are some of the grittiest and creepiest ever made. The first half is much better than the second, which is why my score isn't higher. After awhile the strangeness gives way to a more traditional vampire type story. I'm not sure if we can even call this a vampire movie but it has the primary element -- undead person who craves blood from the living. Tom Savini handled the special effects in one of his earliest films. It's an interesting and worthwhile horror film you should check out.",229,0,,0,No reference

Searching For Sugarman is a documentary surrounding the mysterious story of Rodriguez- a singer/songwriter who, despite his artistic excellence, could not seem to succeed in the American music industry, however, become ""bigger than Elvis"" in South Africa. While the film revolves around finding out whether Rodriguez is dead or alive, Benjelloul takes the audience on journey from diving into his unfortunate beginning, to his rumored suicide in front of thousands after a performance. Benjelloul initially presents Rodriguez in a very cryptic way; and as a viewer who didn't know Rodriguez, I spent a lot of the beginning of the film in a complete rut trying to figure out who he was. The film opens with dialogue from Stephen 'Sugar' Segerman- a record shop owner in South Africa- who introduces Rodriguez by means of communicating the impact that Rodriguez had on the entirety of South Africa. Segerman's introduction of Rodriguez sets the tempo of the film in how all of the opening characters speak of Rodriguez's borderline godly impact on the people of South Africa. However, Benjelloul's purposefully parallels Rodriguez's impact on South Africa along with how little people knew about him in United States to create a sense of suspense. The audience is constantly wondering who he is, while simultaneously being guided into joining ""the hunt"" for Rodriguez. If you don't know who Rodriguez is, you are almost inclined to jump out of your seat and try to find him yourself.",274,0,,0,No reference

1657,2517183,2013-08-28,mrrockey,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009),6.0,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth installment in the long-running series and usually by this point, franchises start to go down the gutter but is Harry Potter one of them? Let's find out!Firstly, the story. The story here about Harry trying to learn about Voldemort's past through Horace Slughorn is actually quite intriguing because it actually FEELS like there's some stakes to the story. If Harry doesn't learn about Voldy's past in time then he will take over the Wizarding World.Jim Broadbent plays Horace Slughorn excellently. He plays him as a bit of a cowardly guy who's heart is in the right place. It could've been easy for him to just play Horace as a poor, innocent guy who was just manipulated by Tom Riddle and while that's partially true, he's also seen as a coward when he refuses to tell Harry anything about Tom and even tampers with his own memory to make it seem like he didn't Tom anything. His character arc is about learning to accept the past and using it and it's acted very well by Broadbent.While that's the main plot of the film, there's also like a million sub- plots going on in this film. Some of them are Draco becoming a Death Eater and being sent to kill Dumbledore, Ginny dating Dean Thomas, Ron dating Lavender Brown, Harry learning about the Half-Blood Prince etc. I think this is one of the biggest problems with this movie because it feels overstuffed. However, it isn't really the filmmakers fault because the book(which I haven't read) from what I hear, had a lot of plot too.The best example of this is the reveal of the Half-Blood Prince. About 40 minutes in, Harry find this Potions book that belongs to the Half- Blood Prince but they never bring up the Half-Blood Prince again until the last 5 minutes of the movie and when they reveal that it's actually Snape, they never explain why he is the Half-Blood Prince. If you are just a viewer of the films like myself, you'll be completely lost about this.But with that being said, I do like most of the sub-plots in this film. My favorite is probably the one about Ron being in a relationship with Lavender. Normally, I would hate this and call it ""high-school bull$hit"" but somehow, Yates manages to make it charming and funny. And the actors sell it really well with all of them playing their roles believably.But I do think this film could use a little more action. This film focuses a lot more on the humor which I don't mind but I don't like how Yates decided to cut out the fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters. After we've spent the majority of the film on relationships, plot, and comedy, I think we could use some action. The worst piece of action in this movie is the attack on the Burrow. Not only is it unexciting, but there's no point to this scene because the Burrow just comes back in the next film anyways!This film also feels kinda long because of the lack of action. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some stupid teenager who needs fight scenes every 5 minutes but because you have so much dialogue, it can feel a little lengthy at times.Lastly, I am gonna touch on the technicals a little bit. The cinematography is gorgeous! The film has this kinda greenish color scheme to it and it looks great! The sound editing is very detailed with lots of sounds going on even when no one's talking, it's very well done! And the visual effects while great, are a lot more subtle this time around and that's good because it shows that the filmmakers cared more about the story than the effects.Overall, while it's certainly not the best film in the series, it's still an entertaining film that's well-acted, good-humored, and visually stunning. I'm gonna give it a 6/10.",662,0,,0,No reference
1658,3084917,2016-05-27,chriswright1969,Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970),8.0,"Beneath The Planet of the Apes (1970) belongs in that list of sequels that could have been as good or even better than the original film. The first sequel to Planet of the Apes (1968) has two strikes against it. The film had only half the budget of the original film and Charlton Heston has a supporting part, while the screenplay was clearly written with his character as the lead. In those days a star did not do sequels, but apparently he was grateful for the success of Planet of the Apes that he did a cameo and donated his salary to charity. Heston became a science fiction icon and would go on in the seventies starring in the SF classics The Omega Man (1971) and Soylent Green (1973).The writers Paul Dehn and Mort Abrahams and director Ted Post took Beneath The Planet of the Apes serious enough and did excellent work despite these limitations. A couple of years later Ted Post would direct another sequel: Magnum Force (1973). The first Dirty Harry sequel which could also be rated as a sequel almost as good as the original.The first 30 minutes of Beneath The Planet of the Apes is a quick rerun of the plot of the original film, but when the lead characters get underground (hence the title), we get a first rate science fiction parable. The underground ruins of New York city are inhabited by mutated humans with psychic powers and worship an atom bomb as a God. This story line does make the ape race secondary characters in the second half.The ending is very nihilistic and seems like a very definitive ending to the series. But because of success at the box office and the ingenuity of the writers, we got three more sequels/prequels. All of them are very enjoyable, but nowhere near as powerful as this first underrated sequel.",313,0,,0,No reference
1659,1487814,2007-07-29,BuffaloWilder,Happy Feet (2006),10.0,"This is one of the most stirring films I've seen in a while, and its no shock that its George bloody Miller directing, writer and director of the Mad Max series, the Babe films, and Lorenzo's Oil. It also shouldn't come as a shock that this movie bares a lot of similarities to ""The Road Warrior,"" either. But, we won't get into that here.Like most of Miller's films, this is a story about the 'underdog hero;' and again, like most of his films, its not afraid to mince around issues of the time. Like Mad Max and the oil situation, this film confronts matters about overfishing without pause. And, by all rights, it should. It's not just a 'Greenpeace' matter, anymore. This is important, the world over. The film's also one that takes its inspiration from many sources, some of the most noticeable being the Jesus/messiah story (don't believe what you've heard from most of the other 'this film is anti-Christian' reviewers. This film is essentially a Jesus/messiah parallel, right down to the Pharisee-like Elders and 'resurrection.') and 'Joseph Livingston Seagull,' among others. They're not 'ripped off,' though, so to speak, and this is good. I suppose you've all seen the film, so there ain't be no summary on this here review. I mean, come on. You can read a summary on any one of these other schmoes reviews! Cam'aaaan!Some people are labeling this film ""liberal propaganda."" I'm not even gonna get in to that, as I still wanna keep my IQ where it is. But, this quote from the man himself will suffice: ""Look,"" Miller says, dismissing low-brow criticism Happy Feet got as eco-propaganda, ""any story worth its salt has to have more to it than meets the eye. I mean, it's got to have a lot going on in the subtext.""This is a heartfelt and moving film, and a giant step for c.g. films both technically and storytelling-wise.

Wee see a beautiful eye, but even though of its beauty, is filled with sorrow, and that's because its dreams just went away and with them, its freedom and happiness. We see the ocean at the back reminding us how dreams come and go like waves, and how they shatter when they hit the shore just like dreams do when they hit reality.This film is like a bucket full of ice and acid thrown at your face while you were sleeping and having the most beautiful dream you've ever had. It's like waking up to the real world after being distracted from it all your life by a silk curtain that suddenly falls and the truth is discovered in the most brutal manner.What are dreams? Can you live your whole life based on dreams and never realize the truth even if it is just in front of you? How hard is to lose those dreams and begin to live life, as it is, brutal, rude and fast? All this questions are answered in this film. A film that stands up from all the films of its kind I've ever seen in my whole life.Notwithstanding of its crudeness, is filled with beauty, color and hope. Hope is the last you lose at times of adversity, and this is proven by the characters of the film, who are incredibly well portrayed by Ellen Byrstein, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and one of the Wayans Bros.
This film is a complete new experience, but not a very pleasant one, is one of those films that you love or hate, but nothing in between. A film that I don't think I would ever see again for what it made me feel, but that I would certainly recommend to anyone.

1665,5303564,2020-10-10,SimonJack,The Scoundrel (1935),4.0,"Many reviewers of ""The Scoundrel"" to date seem to be somewhat enamored just of Noel Coward's presence in this film as Anthony Mallare. His cynical, acerbic movie character seemed to emulate the real Coward. Those ratings are mostly very high. But, one ought to critique a film on all aspects - the plot and the story, the cast and their performances, the screenplay and script, the direction and editing, the sets and filming, and related technical aspects. On that basis - the sum of all of these, this film is not that good.The film was written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur who collaborated on a handful of plays and films. They also co-directed this film. It's a drama, morality play, and a fantasy that becomes apparent only in the last third of the film. The scenes of Mallare's redemption are conflicting. Repentance is missing and sorrow by someone else as a means of a good eternal judgment is a novel idea but not very believable. The movie won an Academy Award for most original story. None of the four films nominated that year are memorable but the others had fair to good box office sales. The Hollywood voters would have known the writers, and some probably saw the film. But it's Oscar win may have surprised many movie audiences who would not have seen the film or even heard of it.Most of the story's characters were supposedly based on real people in the publishing and writing fields. Considering that fact, and the cast that was assembled for this film, and its being made in 1935, it's not very likely that many movie audiences would be familiar with the actors or the real people their characters were based on. Indeed, contrary to a couple of previous reviewers who inferred the success of this film, it must have flopped. This film isn't mentioned in any of the Hollywood and movie books in my library. I couldn't find any box office info on it, even though it won an Oscar and was distributed by Paramount, a major studio of the day. It doesn't appear at all in the Ultimate Movie Rankings list of 195 films from 1935. So, it must have bombed at the box office.The movie was shot in a New York studio - a carryover from the silent film era when New York was the first mecca of movie-making. The only print or online historical reference I could find was a TV Guide article that said the film ""was a favorite of sophisticates, pseudo-sophisticates, and anyone who could recognize the real-life people upon whom the screenplay was based."" Well, that assessment pretty much reduces the likely film audiences. And, since this was smack dab in the middle of the Great Depression, it's hard to imagine a mostly grotesque downer movie such as this having much public appealThere's just too much else that's not good about this film. The first thing that struck me was how stagy it is. The sets look like stage scenery. The screenplay is heavily dialog with no action or movement. And, the characters overall are mostly stilted and wooden. Coward, himself, is the most obvious - the worst at this. With the exception of Cora Moore (Julie Haydon) - but just some of the time, all of the cast utter their lines expressionless and emotionless. Any middle school class of students could read the lines of this play as well as this cast delivers them. That isn't acting - its sitting for a bland monologue reading.Although Coward was a very diversified and talented artist, he is most known and will be forever renowned for the great body of his screenplays. He was not much of a screen actor, and certainly not a leading man. This was just the second of 19 films he made, and first of just two leading roles. Only two more of this cast are actors that movie audiences even in 1935 would have recognized. They are Eduardo Ciannelli as Maurice Stern and Lionel Stander as Rothenstien.The other technical aspects were rudimentary to poor. The camera work is second rate. Oh, there is the tricky over-imposing of scenes for the effect of Tony's death at sea, but even that seemed crude. Mallare's office setting seems almost grotesque. And the music is awful in places.Where the title and references to Anthony Mallare are of a scoundrel, it would be much more accurate to label him and the film, a lecher. He is a lecherous, cold-hearted, self-centered, egotistical cad. But his long cynical and ego-centric lines of dialog soon wear very thin and become grating. The script quickly takes on an aura of nihilism. There's too much that's weak about this drama. The witticism of the writers in the script is lost or drowned out by tedious cynicism and sarcasm. And the narcissistic pale of the play takes its toll in eliminating anything to enjoy about this film. The redemption at the end is conflicting and doesn't work to salvage the film.Here are some sample lines from the film.Cora Moore, ""Why did you lie to her? It's painful to be lied to."" Anthony Mallare, ""My dear, women shoot you or drag you into court if you refuse to lie to them and pretend that you still love them.""Cora Moore, ""You look so evil with a glass in your hand.""Anthony Mallare, ""Would you say, my dear, that Mr. Decker was madly in love with you?"" (Cora nods her head.) Mallare, ""That settles it. I'm not. I never will be. The most I can offer you is one month's diversion and six months of farewell.""Anthony Mallare, ""I don't approve of child labor as a rule, but so much depends on the child.""",955,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

They left behind a large body of work, a vast majority of it being entertaining to classic comedy, at their best they were hilarious and their best efforts were great examples of how to do comedy without being juvenile or distasteful.Although a vast majority of Laurel and Hardy's previous efforts ranged from above average to very good ('45 Minutes from Hollywood' being the only misfire and mainly worth seeing as a curiosity piece and for historical interest, and even that wasn't a complete mess), 'The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case' is nearly one of the best and funniest Laurel and Hardy short films up to this point of their output, one of their best from their overall early work and very nearly one of my personal favourites of theirs. Their filmography, apart from a few bumps along the way, was getting better and better and 'The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case' exemplifies this.It does though have the odd sluggish moment but the only real fault here for me was the ending which like others have said felt very tacked on.'The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case' is non-stop funniness all the way, with one of the better first halves for any Laurel and Hardy effort at this point of their output. There is insane craziness that doesn't get too silly, a wackiness that rarely loses its energy and the sly wit is here, some of the material may not be massively innovative but how it's executed actually feels fresh and it doesn't get repetitive. On top of the comic touches, there is genuine spookiness and suspense as well as a great Gothic atmosphere.Laurel and Hardy are on top form here, both are well used, both have material worthy of them and they're equal rather than one being funnier than the other (before Laurel tended to be funnier and more interesting than Hardy, who tended to be underused). Their chemistry feels like a partnership here too, before 'Two Tars' you were yearning for more scenes with them together but from that point and in 'The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case' we are far from robbed of that.'The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case' looks good visually with some nice Gothic touches, has energy and the direction gets the best out of the stars, is at ease with the material and doesn't let it get too busy or static. The supporting players are solid.Concluding, great. 9/10 Bethany Cox",418,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

As a long time Disney fan I'm probably biased but having the story retold with my favourite actor was a treat for my eyes. I still got emotional at the end of the movie. It's a feel good movie and some ppl just expect too much. Did they want to see a completely new story or what? Not sophisticated enough for them? It's a Disney classic pls.. Idk but I would recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to kick back and relax for a couple hours with a happy ending and familiar awesome songs.,124,1,,0,No reference
1670,975004,2005-06-17,wgeddings,Batman Begins (2005),10.0,"I was a comic collector as a child and young adult so I obviously love comic book movies. The Superman movies were okay and the Batman movies were also barely okay. They emphasized the things that made them non-comic book and took away many of the comic book elements. When Marvel started getting great movies with X-Men and Spiderman, I saw that someone finally had learned to do it right. Of course there are some misses (Elektra) but overall, I have come to expect more of Marvel comic book movies than anything from DC (the company which owned Superman, Batman, Justice League, etc.).This movie really goes back to the comic book roots. Forget the other Batman movies, they have nothing to do with this one. In this Batman, you see how Bruce becomes a hero and why he chose Batman. The portrayal of Gotham and of Thomas Wayne (Bruce's father) help to flesh things out more like the way a comic story would than ""character development"" in a movie fashion. The league of shadows and the Scarecrow all flow with the story rather than serve as elements inserted as generic villains of the week.I completely enjoyed this movie and although some elements are different from the comic book, they are true to the spirit of the books and that is what counts (like Spiderman being able to shoot webbing without webshooters was still faithful to the idea of the comic). I hope you will give it a try and support Hollywood making movie actually from comic books rather than just movies with titles or characters from comic books.",268,0,,0,No reference

It's a short and yet entertaining journey for the whole family that is most definitely worth seeing with the whole family. The modern feel of the movie with the olden times setting is done really well and the humor works with the great cast of characters. Not going to give anything more away, but I will just say even with repeated watches it's still good.

1678,2144385,2011-06-27,JamesHitchcock,Batman Begins (2005),7.0,"Together with ""Superman"", Batman is probably the comic-book character who has most become part of popular culture. They have, in a way, become urban legends, in the sense that they are the legendary folk-heroes of a modern, urbanised industrial culture, just as Robin Hood and King Arthur were the legendary folk-heroes of rural, pre-industrial Britain. The two crime-fighting superheroes are superficially similar, but their legends are different in tone. The ""Superman"" stories are more optimistic; life in the light, airy city of Metropolis is generally good, and any malefactors are dealt with by the gentlemanly Superman, originally from an alien planet but an ardent patriot for his adopted country, who fights crime out of an idealistic belief in truth, justice and the American way. Gotham City, by contrast, is a darker, more sinister place, a decaying-crime-ridden city. Batman himself, in most incarnations of the character, is portrayed as psychologically disturbed, a superhero crime fighter whose motivation is not so much idealism as revenge for the murder of his parents. The original ""Superman"" franchise was responsible for kick-starting the modern superhero movie, a genre which has enjoyed a remarkably long lease of life, and when this franchise ran out of steam in the late eighties, the torch passed to the ""Batman"" series. Although many people praised the two Tim Burton films, the four episodes from the nineties never struck me as being entirely successful, largely due to the lack of a single actor who could incarnate the hero in the same way as the late Christopher Reeve succeeded in making himself the definitive Superman. Michael Keaton always struck me as miscast, Val Kilmer was just dull, and even the normally charismatic George Clooney failed to arouse much interest. In my youth the Batman I was familiar with was Adam West from the light-hearted TV series, but his interpretation of the character was abandoned by Tim Burton in the first two episodes of the film series. The two episodes directed by Joel Schumacher, however, were much lighter in tone, even if they never became quite as camp and jokey as the TV programme, and the critical failure of the second of these, ""Batman & Robin"", led to the franchise being rethought. ""Batman Begins"" was the first ""Batman"" film for eight years, and the new director Christopher Nolan returns to the dark, brooding look of the Burton films. ""Batman Begins"", as the title suggests, takes the legend back to the beginning. It tells the story of the young Bruce Wayne and of how his wealthy parents- portrayed here as idealistic philanthropists and benefactors of the city- are gunned down by a mugger. Burning with desire for revenge, Bruce disappears to the Himalayas to train with a mysterious crime-fighting organisation known as the League of Shadows. And here the film springs a surprise. The influence of Chinese martial arts movies has led to the stock cliché in American films of the noble Asian martial-arts warrior who combines fighting skills with a quasi-religious philosophy and a strong moral code. It therefore comes as something of a surprise when the League turns out not to be an enlightened brotherhood of holy warrior-monks but a ruthless vigilante force which Bruce, concerned about its lack of compassion, refuses to join. The head of the League, Ra's al Ghul, later turns up as the chief villain, author of a plot to destroy Gotham City, which he sees as hopelessly corrupt. The other villain featured is the Scarecrow, a corrupt psychiatrist who specialises in the use of fear-creating hallucinogenic toxins. I won't summarise the rest of the plot (it gets far too complex), but I will say that of the five ""Batman"" films I have seen this struck me as the best. (I haven't seen the recent ""The Dark Knight""). One reason for this is a remarkably strong cast. Christian Bale is certainly the best of the four actors to have played the main character; he is able to suggest the psychological anguish which torments Bruce/Batman, yet at the same time make him a largely sympathetic character with whom the audience can identify. Other distinguished actors in the cast- all of whom play their parts very well- include Michael Caine as Wayne's butler Alfred, Liam Neeson in a rare appearance as a villain as Ra's al Ghul, Tom Wilkinson as the gangster Carmine Falcone, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, an executive of Wayne Enterprises who becomes Batman's ally, and Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, one of the few honest cops on the Gotham force. (Gordon is here a mere sergeant, not Commissioner of Police as he was in the TV series). The weak link is the insipid Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, Bruce's childhood friend who becomes a crusading prosecutor. (Rachel was presumably invented to provide an important female character in an otherwise male-dominated film). The other reason for the relative success of ""Batman Begins"" is a more intelligent than usual script dealing with such weighty matters as vigilantism, the relationship between justice and revenge and the relationship between fear and power. (Both Falcone and the Scarecrow draw their power from their ability to inspire fear in others). Overall, this is more than just a run-of-the-mill superhero caper. 7/10",869,0,,0,No reference

""Narcos: Mexico"" uses the same modus operandi but unfortunately fails in all aspects to reach the same level of brilliance as the original series ""Narcos"". Sad to, but everything is of significantly lower quality, not least the acting. No character has the intensity and nerve seen in all of the 3 seasons of ""Narcos"". Unfortunately, Diego Luna is not even close to convincing as protagonist. Waiting for him to actually start acting, to see the development of the character of growing into and becoming a cartel leader, turns out to be futile. For a stark contrast, the scene in episode 5 with Wagner Moura returning as Pablo Escobar (and several other characters/actors from the original ""Narcos"") and Diego Luna is very revealing. In short: the ""Narcos""-crew in general and Moura in particular inexorably and hands off just steals the show... The contrast is quite embarrassing. The juxtaposition of ""Narcos: Mexico"" with its predecessor brings clarity; making top notch programming is no joke. Points for effort deserved- but this killed the magic of the series.

Like they wrote on paper list of plot points they would like to have in the movie and then wrote some story to join it together. At first it starts as Bourne Identity/Leon ripoff, then it goes into classic revenge tale of a cop who's child was a drug victim, so he joins main protagonist to hunt criminal mastermind using unusual methods... And then it goes for the Memento/Oldboy kind of third act with a huge twist that will leave you in awe (sarcasm sign)... This movie steals from all over the place... Not to say that you can't make a good movie sticking to genre conventions, Tarantino made a career for himself by referencing and ripping off other people... But usually it's expected that you throw some of your own touches into the mix, and it also doesn't hurt to be little self aware. This movie takes it self way too seriously! So seriously that by the third act it's laughably bad.

But maybe it's not fair to label it as a bad movie just because it steals every psychological thriller ever made, so let's deconstruct it's level of badness. Execution is really bad... And don't say how i'm nitpicking, because if you have the money to get all of those locations equipment etc. It wouldn't hurt if you knew how to choreographed and shoot action. Other than that one shitty scene where Nikola Kojo breaks this one guys nose (they would cut after every punch to a same shot, only different take... why, only god knows), there isn't that may opportunities to show how bad at it they actually are at it but the last big showdown shitty as hell in those terms. From continuity errors to errors of logical kind... Nikola Kojo is trying to give it his best, and he is... He's trying to give some sort of depth to a shallow character but he is just plain overacting. And really, are you gonna cast Dragan Petrovic in that role, by the minute you see him on the screen you know that something's not right with him... it's his typical role... Jut like Nikola Kojo is here in his almost typical role... Maja Karan plays only one role ever, she's always the same and it's no exception here. Almost everyone is playing their typical character here, everything about this movie says that it's a movie made by committee. it's really a shame that in Serbia only small group of people get to decide on that projects should money be spent and that they always give it to the untalented people with no vision or artistic expression.

In the near future couples are incapable of having children as females have become infertile and society is in a state of crumbling when a lone black girl(who is pregnant) is the only hope of an antidote. The task of our lead(Clive Owen) is to take her to safety aided by a few others. The film looks bleak because of the saturated colors and England looks like a depressing place. The camerawork and pacing is quite good and a long tracking shot in a car is rather beautiful in its execution. The director would go on to helm Gravity and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban so the style is a constant.

No further development of characters, all black and white, all it matters for a good horror movie is horror itself. In ""dans la foret"" we have a character who struggles and fights with his demons and in his desperation turns to his 6 years old son for help, a little boy, who having a special charisma can actually personalize his father's evil side. To a sentimentally intelligent viewer the ""peace"" the little boy offers to his father, a process which helps him too to get rid of his nightmares as it is illustrated in the end of the film is really heartbreaking and deeply human. Horror is part of the story but not its goal. I strongly recommend the film to the ones who like psychological thrillers based on human characters and not just horror.

Even when I hate a movie, I can usually point to something that was done well. But not this time.I suppose I could say that Bad Santa elicited a few guilty chuckles here and there; I felt dirty and uncomfortable laughing but the sheer ridiculousness of the titular character did, once or twice, bring a sheepish smile to my lips. It wasn't enjoyable, however, and I ardently wish I hadn't seen this venomously hateful wart of a film.Billy Bob Thornton plays a sodden, sociopathic con man who, along with a smarmy, foul- mouthed midget, uses his position as a shopping mall Santa to break into department stores after hours and crack safes. He is also an abusive, self-loathing sex addict and, as his midget accomplice informs him at one point, everything about him is ugly. He commits random acts of destruction and violence in a sort of drunken haze; this is not a sympathetic character, nor even an antihero. It is clear from the beginning that ""Santa"" is a very dangerous, chaotic man.There's so much profanity in the dialogue that it's often hard to make out exactly what the characters are talking about. You can feel the writers' love of potty-mouthed toilet humor, as they interject it unnecessarily into every single scene. There is also a predictable number of graphic sex scenes, crotch-kicking gags, unfunny jokes involving a senile elderly woman and her emotionally disturbed, mentally challenged son, and so forth. Never does the movie tinge its irreverence with even a hint of warmth; this is a coldly cruel production designed to titillate the lowest and worst in its audience.I came away from Bad Santa feeling unhappy and disturbed. There is no message here, no point, except that calculated nihilism will always win in the end and concepts like love, beauty, and hope are for saps and suckers who exist only as playthings for the antisocial. This is a movie for true misanthropes only.",347,0,,0,No reference

He's from a well-to-do family, and she knows they could never work as a couple, even though she wants to let herself love him. He seems not to care about their differences, even when he finds out what she does for a living. It all ends tragically and abruptly, but makes for some very compelling melodrama in the meantime.The pre-Code frankness and grit do a lot to keep the maudlin sentimentality at bay in this story that could come across as a second-rate soap opera. If this had been made ten years later (which it was, in a version starring Vivien Leigh and which I have not seen), it would have been drenched in a syrupy score that would have given us non-stop cues about what emotions we were supposed to be feeling at every turn. But there's a matter-of-factness about this film that's as surprising as any of the actual content. I've found that frequently with these pre-Code films, what's shocking about them is not the racy material, but rather the tone pervading them.Clark gives a very good performance, but I was actually more impressed with Kent Douglass as the young soldier. He has a natural acting style that seems ahead of its time compared to his contemporaries. And Bette Davis has a small role as the soldier's sister, and proves why she became one of the biggest stars of all time. Every time she's on screen, and even in a few instances when you can't see her but can only hear her, she completely dominates the film.And maybe this makes me sound supremely stupid, but I didn't know London dealt with a blitz during WWI as well.Grade: A-",297,0,,0,No reference

1704,2562255,2013-11-19,damianeberly,Driving Lessons (2006),2.0,There are two reasons why I think that diving lessons was a bad movie and a complete wast of time. First of all there were to many things not finished. The other problem with this movie was it took to long for it to enfold.even know it is a coming to age kind of movie it would of not hurt to put a little more detail into what happened to some of the people like Mr.Fincham. Let me start with why the ending of this movie could have been put together better.When the movie ended there were more questions than answerers. There are three pieces that were not answered and could have helped the move the movie to a more peaceful ending. First what happened to Mr. Fincham? The last time we saw him he hit someone with a car and after was never seen again. For all we know he could still be out there hitting people with cars. The problem I have is what happened to the girl Ben was with. The last time we saw her she was saying buy to Ben and never showed up again. Wouldn't you think she would show up at least one more time to talk to Ben but just like Mr. Fincham saw is never seen again. The final thing is what is going to happen to Ben's family. It ended with him kind of talking to his dad and it looked like he would never talk to mom again than it ended with no way to guess if he is going to talk to anyone ever again. These are the reason why I did not like the way the movie and the way it ended. The other reason why I did not like this very boring movie is it took about an hour to get to anything that was even interesting. The beginning of the movie was slow and had very little meaning to the whole movie. When Ben did meet Evie the movie started to pick up. For a little bit the movie was going at the right speed but then it started to pick up that pace. At the end of the movie to many things happened at the same time and right after that it just ended. It felt like someone hit the fast-forward button for the final 30 minutes and then right when everything was told the same person hit the pause button and never hit the play button again. If you would fix these parts in the movie I think the movie would have been a lot better than how they made it. It was almost a waste of time as a movie because not that many things was explained and charters just came in than after a while were never seen again.,468,0,,0,No reference

It makes a stylish premise for this movie, which was based on the best-selling ""Dr. Strange"" comics.The ""astral"" sequences are handled with style and grace.  The actors play their respective parts very well.I'd recommend this neat little movie both as entertainment and as a springboard for discussions.

1711,2888092,2015-06-20,aedesjanus,Sound and Fury (2000),7.0,"Two brothers, one deaf (Peter Artinian) and one hearing (Chris Artinian), have deaf children and struggle with the question of getting cochlear implants for them. Whereas Chris is entirely for the procedure, Peter and his wife, Nita (also deaf), have great difficulties accepting what they feel would separate their daughter from them. The film's setting is a solidly middle class community on Long Island.The profound contradictions between Peter's affirmation of his deaf identity, and his having proved that independent of it, he is a ""success"", and his desire to impose his sense of community on his young daughter is strangely compelling. Peter's intensity regarding his daughter comes across as narcissistic and disingenuous. Nita's manipulation of the child in one of the final scenes goes a long way to alienate the audience.But Aronson succeeds in making both sides of the family appear ambivalent. The presence of all at the annual deaf convention leads to heated debates about the destruction of community that the technology will bring. These debates also throw into relief the projection that the hearing have about deafness as handicap. Emotionally, the deaf community is portrayed as having constituted itself as a self-protective, parallel society. There is strength in their otherness, as they are distinct and do not want to overcome this.By being biologically modified they become part of the greater capitalist narrative of success or failure, independent of what makes them different. This is a loss, and Peter is the most sensitive to this, despite how impossible it is for him to articulate it in the film. The irony is that the esoteric part of his experience has also cut him off from the ability to evolve to a point in his thinking that would transcend his limitations. The film is much less about the limitations of deafness per se, but rather on the long terms emotional impacts of alterity, self-imposed or otherwise. Being other took all of Peter's strength and is fulcrum of the choices he has made. It also provides for him the chance to depend on others who have made the same unwilling sacrifices.With his alterity removed, he is no longer a hero. His sacrifices perhaps fleeting and unnecessary. It is here that the frailty and ambivalence of self-importance is portrayed. With no counter-factual otherness to bind him to others, the perceived poetry that was his suffering, will be silenced. For Peter, this is a form of being born again deaf in another dimension. But all of this does not create meaning for a little girl who has no intrinsic standing in this pathos. If she can belong, she no does need to be the measure of another (in)justice. No one makes that clearer to Peter than his hearing mother, father, and brother.Aronson's intense scrutiny of the ambivalence of otherness is fascinating because of just how much detail it leaves in place. We can feel the right answer, but are somehow left with an unresolved and unsettling feeling of being perpetrators. By believing in the right of the normal to assert itself, we assert it in ways that implicitly negatively impact others. Aronson's film does not help us resolve this tension, and that is at the core of the films poignancy.",536,0,,0,No reference

The Hobbit is an entertaining, heartwarming, and humorous film that nobody will recognize that views it with a critical eye. Having seen it in 48 frames per second I see why people dislike the technology. As a teenage film critic I couldn't help but notice the mistakes. The speed of the frames is jarring at first, many things that would look real look fake...then, I start seeing plates flying, start hearing the dwarfs sing, and start feeling the emotion and humor and the action starts and I'm entranced in the likability of the film. Slowly I'm not watching a movie but being transported into Middle Earth. The frame rate stops becoming annoying and starts enhancing the experience. If you treat this like a movie you won't enjoy the fun. If you try to treat it like actual events in the Lord of the Rings series you miss the point of the film. Bilbo is recalling the story from his memory, and like Gandalf says in the movie, ""All good stories deserve embellishment."" This is the way it's being told, maybe not how it happened. The editing is slower than modern films. Many complained about the pace, but every scene has a purpose in future sequels, no scene is poorly written, and I loved every single one of these characters, including the trippy Radagast. 48 frames isn't perfect yet, isn't the new standard, but a new way to watch film. If you find yourself too attached to the cinematic experience this will be different. It's not headache 3D, it gives the feeling of a live performance with awesome effects, and gives HD minus the annoyance. I love it! It turns of the film critic and brings in the story lover.This deserves a 10, it is by far the most immersive films of the year, but because it is a prequel to a superior series I cannot raise expectations too high.

1713,2911851,2015-07-31,pyrocitor,The Grass Is Greener (1960),8.0,"Bookmarked by a cheery chorus extolling the joys of ""the stately homes of England"", Stanley Donen's The Grass is Greener at first promises to be a pleasantly rich, thoroughly British comedy of manners, repartee and archly subtle barbs ready to go. The film elicits so comfortable a viewing state, in fact, that it takes some time to clue into the slow, inextricable escalation evolving on screen. The final result is an impressive transformation indeed: a sly, witty affair (pun intended) that, while unpacking the virtue of old-fashioned sensibilities, demonstrates a markedly modern undercurrent of risqué subtext and the place of tradition and posterity in the twentieth century. Donen's film is a charming and sophisticated satire, without ever becoming stuffy or unengaging. Most importantly, it highly enjoyable through and through.The film's clever script by Hugh Williams and Margaret Vyner, nimbly repurposing their own play, keeps the plot plugging along at a slow but subtly rising pace, with an opening poking fun at vacant tourists and the upper class elite stubborn enough to cling to the antiquated decadence of their heritage while begrudgingly opening their historic homes to the riff raff for sustainable income. However, as the conflict settles in, enough genuinely surprisingly twists and turns and pockets of action pop up for the film to never feel excessively talky. It's also impressive how cavalier the film is about its central infidelity conflict and (arguably more controversial) the motivations behind sustaining a strained marriage. Mercifully absent is the implicit judgement in many comparable narratives released in the thick of the Hays Code, making the film feel much more like a story than an ideologically spring-loaded cautionary tale.Unsurprisingly, the film's main draw is its trifecta of Hollywood mega stars comprising the central love triangle, the allure of whom Donen cheekily demystifies by introducing them as squabbling babies over the opening credits. However, rather than awards-baiting scene-chomping, Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum all turn restrained, deadpan performances - this is a British comedy of manners, after all, and acting out would be intolerably uncouth. Nonetheless, all three possess such natural star magnetism that, when armed with the script's arsenal of clever zingers and double-entendres, makes them eminently watchable throughout.An uncomfortable situation unwound to its full satirical potential, The Grass is Greener unpacks social performativity with deft ease. Fans of the stars, or those seeking an old-fashioned jaunt with a slyly contemporary edge are cordially invited to experience the distinct pleasure of visiting this stately home of England.-8/10",415,0,,0,No reference

It got worse during each action scene. Why the hell do they film it as if the actors have cameras attached to every part of their body?

1719,615979,2003-06-19,tedg,Punchline (1988),,"Spoilers herein.Filmmakers like to tinker with genres. That's the most direct and easy path to cleverness. One template is to make two genres into characters, then to embody them in people. When the people interact, you have a battle of film genres. When the people are alone, you have the genre in its normal form. Lynch took this to extremes with ""Blue Velvet"" of the year or two before. Although the craft is far less here, the ambition is equally advanced.On the one hand, we have a simple date movie: charming Sally (with her charming girls) has a marriage dilemma. There's some charming humor with making dinner. There's some minor threat to all this sweetness (the threat represented by the big, bad Church), even (gasp!!!) a bad hairdo. But loving husband comes through in the end. Sally is perfect for this, our prototype of absolute earnestness, moving through Lucille redheadedness.On the other hand we have a genre that has exploded in the past decade: the reflexive film where the performances are about performances, the skits are about skits, the character is schizoid because the position of the actor is also, simultaneously playing the performed and the performer. Here it is a standup comedian whose life and performance are confused. Sally is an archetype but she is also a performer so she finds herself sharing the stage, even contesting the stage with Hanks. Naturally she doesn't need to win, and her genre resolves as planned.Hanks does need to win. He lives in two layers: the madness of the performer and the madness of the performance: a commonly sought situation for intelligent actors. I call this folding. The whole film is constructed around one scene, the scene in the diner where Sally distances her genre from Hanks; genre and (because he is layered) his character. Watch him try the inside-outside acting shifts that Jack Nicholson invented. Watch him quote one of the most influential films in the folded films movement (for Hollywood), ""Singing in the Rain."" Watch him even try a few Brando mannerisms.Its a pretty brilliant idea. And it is pretty inspired and risky acting. Hanks has since become a joke, When he says he made only three good movies, I am certain he has this one in mind. Actually, his thread is bungled by the writer/director. There?s a bad decision in introducing his character with an anatomy test. And his material doesn't match his character: when comedy is a defense against life it is different than lots of what he does, excepting the ""hate stylist"" notion.But he really does try here, and it is an intelligent notion.Ted?s Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",446,0,,0,No reference

The problem I have with most though is that I've seen so many I tend to figure them out before the final moments of the film. So when one comes along that catches me completely off guard it becomes one that I want people to know about. I SEE YOU is one of those films.The movie is actually divided into two parts, the second half reflecting on the first. It's fall in a small town and the people are frightened for their children when a young teen goes missing. Det. Greg Harper (Jon Tenney) is the lead detective on the case, a case with few clues. But that's not the only issue Harper is dealing with.There is problems at home as well. Harper's wife Jackie (Helen Hunt) was cheating on him and they're trying to make things work. His son Connor (Judah Lewis) is resentful of his mother's indiscretion and holds her responsible for the falling apart of their family. Every effort she makes to try and correct things he tosses back in her face.The ""have you seen"" posters are placed around town and the search for the boy continues. When Harper and his partner Spitzky (Gregory Alan Williams) go back over the crime scene they discover something they missed the first time around. It's a green pocket knife and references a previous crime they worked years ago. Could that same killer have returned?As the case moves forward strange things begin happening in the Harper home. And entire drawer of silverware disappears. Noises are heard. Windows are found open. Then the worst of it all happens when Jackie's lover shows up trying to convince her to run away with him. Leaving him in the garage when she goes to answer the door, someone kills him. Is there something supernatural involved here? Or could it be something else. Time for a spoiler alert if you don't want to know.This is where the movie shifts gears as Connor reads a text screen that asks him if he's ever heard of phrogging. If, like me, you haven't I'm sure your hitting your cell phone now to look it up. Phrogging is when perpetrators, mostly teens, sneak into a home and attempt to live there without the knowledge of the home owner. It's a way to have a place to stay and to get some sort of thrill.Mindy (Libe Barer) and Alec (Owen Teague) are two such teens who have placed themselves in the Harper home, hiding out when they are home and wandering around when they're gone. These are the two responsible for the mysterious goings on. But it gets better. Alec is one to push things to the edge while Mindy plays it safe. Could it be that Alec plans on taking things even further than Mindy expects?This plot twists is mesmerizing and director Adam Randall uses a deft touch to bring it all about. Using up perhaps two thirds of the films short 96 minute running time he crafts the story to fit a certain mold, a horror film if you will involving what are potentially spooks gone wild. And then like Hitchcock did when he altered the story of a secretary stealing money into a serial killer in PSYCHO, the movie changes into something completely different. Quite an accomplishment for only a second film from Randall.Screenwriter Devon Graye is now someone I want to watch. An actor with 53 films under his built this is the first one he's written. He's done a magnificent job for his first time out. The characters are believable and ones we come to care for. We wonder if perhaps Jackie is losing her mind. Or is there something supernatural? Or is it the phroggers? Or could it be something else entirely?Hunt doesn't make that many movies these days and it was a pleasure to see her back in a role she handles with ease. It looks like she's making a return to acting after several years away and that's a good thing to happen. Tenney is an actor who's been overlooked for too long. He too does a great job here. And all of the young actors on hand also turn in performances that are exceptional, something we rarely see from teens on film.To my knowledge this film played in few if any theaters and that's a shame. I've seen bigger budgeted films with more hoopla upon their release that didn't compare to this one. For me I know it's one I can not only recommend heartily but could sit and watch more than once looking for those tiny details I might have missed the first time around. For now I would tell any and all that this film makes a great viewing night and suggest you rent it when you can.",803,0,,0,No reference

That is except gambling and bluffing a way thru life. When grumpy Colonel Willoughby-Gore visits the class, he is mortified to find the boys have learnt next to nothing of value in Twist's class. Seeking to get Twist fired, Gore calls on the school board to fire him. But wanting to be fair, the board suggest that Twist and eight of is class enter the inter-school examinations in London. Where, if they make the grade, Twist will save his job. Oh dear! Not only is his job in the hands of a bunch of gambling, smoking dunces, but trouble comes in the form of Arty Jones, an escaped convict and father to one of Twist's boys. There's a robbery in the pipeline, and Twist and his class are going to be right in the middle of it.To all intents and purposes, Good Morning Boys is structurally a remake of Will Hay's frothy entertainer, Boys Will Be Boys from 1935. Much like the 35 film, this film sees Hay as a bumbling teacher surrounded by roguish boys and with shifty crooks on the horizon. There's still an affluent lady who's on Twist's side, a gruff Colonel who's out to get Twist and a crooked father of one of the boys after a priceless item. However, in spite of the obvious similarities (there's more, such as the ""Watt is a unit of electricity"" replacing the ""how high is a Chinaman""? skit), the quality of writing and direction is considerably better.This was the first of eight films that Marcel Varnel directed Hay in, of which it's fair to say contain half a dozen of them that are Hay's best pictures. Correctly suggesting that both men were comfortable working with each other. The other first of note is that this was the film that saw Hay bring Dr Benjamin Twist to the screen, he would reprise the character twice more in Convict 99 (1938) and Hey! Hey! USA (also 1938). Here the plot contains plenty of zip to it as teacher and boys end up in Paris, where the Louvre, and a certain Mona Lisa painting, provide scope for plenty of laughs. Of which Hay and his colleagues are only too happy to deliver the goods. Prior to this we have indulged in cheeky cheating, search party fun patrol and a bookies blackboard skit that's purely joyous in its writing. But it's with the Paris set finale that it hits its mark, acrobats and punch ups are merely the start of the fun on its way.Joining Hay on the cast list is the integral to his career, Graham Moffatt as Albert Brown {a character Moffatt played 7 times with Hay}. With notable performances also coming from Martita Hunt, Peter Gawthorne, Fewlass Llewellyn, Mark Daly, Lilli Palmer (who sings the delightful ""Baby, Whatcha Gonna Do Tonight?"") and look out for a young Charles Hawtrey as a posh class swot. It may be missing the considerable comic excellence of Hay's other important career sidekick, Moore Marriott, but it's still one of the better Hay movies to forever enjoy and savour. 8/10",533,0,,0,No reference

One of the problems with Kansas Raiders is that the Youngers and Jameses were psychotic killers, too. Making them heroes is like making a hero out of O J Simpson or Charles Manson.But we could go on about that. There is adequate action and adventure. The hero isn't exactly likable, though Frank James is. It is usual for films to depict Jesse as the hot head who gets killed, and Frank as level headed. This is poetic license, and few people have problems with this.Certainly a lot of garbage if taken seriously, but I give it a 3 because it is good for light hearted fare, but I recommend an R rating for this, while I'd give ""Ride For the Devil"" a G rating, because of the misinformation and the horrible morality of making Jesse James a hero.Finally, watching this film will really make you appreciate the quality of ""Ride With the Devil"", if you already don't appreciate it.",295,0,,0,No reference

Gable, a con man, has to hot-foot it from the police after a scam gone wrong and winds up in the apartment of Harlow, who's no slouch in the pilfering business herself, though she gets her dough from an array of men in her life. After an uneasy start, they become close and embark on a relationship, one that isn't above the odd con job, but, when one goes horribly wrong, Gable is on the lam again and Harlow is sent off to a reformatory for women! Here things get a little sticky as Harlow pines for Gable and he risks everything in order to see her. A gaggle of fellow inmates work overtime in order to reunite the couple as the police close in. Gable looks positively adorable here. He delivers his lines with confidence and panache, but also reveals many different shades as his character begins to regard Harlow as more than just another floozy. His big emotional scene is, perhaps, a bit beyond his range, but most of the time he's in fine form and shares sparkling chemistry with his leading lady. Harlow is equally fine. She has a boatload of one-liners and wisecracks and delivers them all with her wonderfully common and knowing persona. She doesn't skimp on the emotional aspects of her character, though. It's a strong performance with a lot of variety to it. She is filmed, however, with some astonishingly heavy soft focus for someone who was only 22 or 23! Erwin appears as one of Harlow's devoted suitors and Burgess (the real-life niece of Fay Bainter) is one of Gable's cast-offs. She and Harlow have some terrifically bitchy exchanges in the film along with some physicality. Notable for its time is the fairly prominent presence of Harris as a black inmate at the reformatory. Though she is depicted as rooming in a different area, she spends much time in Harlow's room and has a substantial role with no mention made of race. Her father in the film, played by Reed, also has a critical role, though that is one of the more saccharine bits of the storyline. A good example of how busy MGM's stable of supporting players were is Friderici as the head matron. She appeared in 15 films the year before this one and 10 this year before dying in December (and appearing in two previously-filmed 1934 films after that!) The vast difference between the lighthearted first half and the more soapy second half may disappoint some viewers, but fans of the stars will surely enjoy seeing them go through their paces regardless.

I always like to begin with something positive, but this is the first film I've ever reviewed where I could find nothing good to say.This film ran and looked like what my kid brother and I used to shoot for fun when we were kids.Seriously, this film just never comes together. There were some decent actors; for example Walter Perez gave it all he could to try to find depth in an otherwise two-dimensional, clichéd drug lord character, Jason. The problem was he was fishing in shallow water. And, whoever heard of a drug lord named Jason?My question is, how did this film even get made? Weren't there checks and balances along the way that screamed, ""CAUTION, CAUTION, STAY AWAY""? The script is the main problem, the directing and acting follows close behind, but I blame the people who paid for this film to even be produced. Did they know ANYTHING at all about film making before they jumped into the business? I guess there will always be foolish people with more money than sense who want to be in the movie-making business.I think the best I can say about this film is that with a $2.5 million budget and only about a $77,707 take, it restores my faith in the movie-going public.",221,0,,0,No reference

1753,1820933,2009-06-24,EijnarAmadeus,Rosemary's Baby (1968),9.0,"Roman Polanski's 1968 classic 'Rosemary's Baby' deals with a subject matter that's first class horror material; the birth of Antichrist. Set in mid 60ties New York we meet the married couple of housewife Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and struggling actor Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes). Moving into their new apartment they befriend the old neighbor couple of Minnie and Roman Castavet, who Guy becomes unusually close to. Guy soon lands a major role and starts heading for success, and with this he decides to stop his self-centered behavior and focus on his wife and so they decide to have a baby. Becoming ill the same night, Rosemary encounters a terrible dream the night of the intercourse with spiritualistic and mythological aspects, which is the start of a slowly spiraling pregnancy towards darkness.Polanski created a shocking film when it was released in 1968. It's thematic content is frightening and obnoxious, and it certainly lead the way for William Friedkin's 1973 'The Exorcist'. Mia Farrow's performance is her best, it's a harsh performance that shows her sickening mind and body afraid of what she's facing; Cassavetes (who was the symbol of cool and daring independent movie-making as a director in the 60ties and 70ties) pulls out a strange but interesting performance, at further viewings it may you might feel that Guy knows what's going on from the very first second, but then again, he pulls out this lovable husband that shows genuine interest in her well-being. And for me, the film is mostly engaging as an interior study of marriage facing unsureness and scare, with the pure horror elements of the plot coming second rate when it comes down at the end. It's more a drama film with a dark underbelly (with certainly interesting revelatory aspects), than a full-on shocking horror film about the birth of Antichrist. Cause like in 'The Exorcist', you have a demon-possessed little girl with a transformed, monstrous face who's vomiting, spitting, squirming, attacking and shouting crude one-liners; in 'Rosemary's Baby' we're given an intensity surrounding ""what's going on with this bright young lady?"" - and the horror comes in her grueling sickening, her more and more dominant paranoia, her husband's mysterious behavior, the old couple's weird behavior, and all the subtle clues given throughout. 'Rosemary's Baby' was a daring film back then, and its own ""under-performance"" of the plot grows more and more in mind afterward.",397,0,,0,No reference

Surface is definitely one of the best TV shows I ever saw, with excellent actors and crew, and almost perfect effects. It's real blessing that Croatian television bought rights for this series, cause I wouldn't know about it - this way I saw first two episodes on a telly and that moment I found whole series on the internet (that was no piracy - just couldn't wait for Surface to end)... One of the reasons why one of our TV stations bought Surface, lays in fact that Croatian actor Rade Serbedzija has one of leading roles in episodes 1-7, but like I said - it was like blessing. I watched 15 episodes in a blink of an eye, and really can't understand why show with so many credits ended just like that? Every day we are watching thousands of really stupid TV shows - why producers ended this fantastic series after 1st season?

During the first parts of the film I have to be honest, I was confused. But then as the movie continued, even with its different form of narrative in which the events are all tangled up it was easy to follow.
What the film does best is how it makes you question you own actions in the past, and if given with the option to forget or change it, would you? I, for one thought a lot about some of my past actions that I wish I could do something about. When you know the outcome of an event it really makes you wonder what you could have done differently and how that would affect you in the present.
Jim Carrey's acting is great in the film, as you can really relate to him and his conflict, and how he is unsure and shy. The way I see it, Joel and Clementine compliment each other. Joel is soft-spoken and careful, and Clementine speaks her mind and always goes with the moment. Together they have experiences that they wouldn't have had if they weren't together, as she makes him live more and takes him out of his seemingly boring life. He helps her stay in the moment, but I think that overall Clementine gave Joel more than he did to her. His life turns interesting and he does things he would have never done otherwise.
An interesting thing of the film is the other storyline of Mary, Stan and Dr. Howard. It's interesting because Mary had her memory erased and moved on in life and started dating Stan, but as she learned the truth this life she had been living collapsed. In my opinion her decision to give everyone their memories was not the correct one. Like these people have most likely moved on, and yes, they might have lost precious memories, but it was their decision and maybe they are happy now. Maybe some people fought back the procedure inside their head, like Joel did, but not everyone, who knows what the erased from their mind. Maybe their memories were extremely painful to remember, and because of this I believe this decision was not the morally correct one.
Finally, at the end of the film Joel and Clementine will give it another chance at being together after their memories have been returned. Personally I think that the two of them will be able to work it out as a pair and stay together, as they will learn from their previous mistakes. Regardless of this, the most important learnings are that of taking risks, giving second chances and to hold on to that that makes you feel happy and complete",476,0,,0,No reference

When watching it the stuff between Johnson and Hart is so good that I have to hope they are going to do another movie with a script like this one. This movie is more fun than any film I have seen in a long time.Too often when WWF Wrestler's get into acting, their egos are so large, they can't transfer it into acting or comedy. Dwayne Johnson (aka. The Rock) does that transfer here. He shows he can act and do comedy with great skill at both and does not let anything get in his way. Kevin Hart does not hurt as the two of them with a full foot difference in height really seem to have this down. Their timing and pace are so good that I could not help laughing more than I have at a movie in a long time.It is almost hard at times to take the CIA spy plot seriously, but then every so often you get to wondering who are really the good guys and who are really the bad guys. The script is good enough to keep you wondering for most of the film. Centering around a 20 year high school reunion the plot works well. This one is worth checking out because it really lightens the mood and the supporting cast really backs it up too. Both Amy Ryan and Danielle Nicolet stand tall here despite being shorter than Kevin Hart. The Golden Jet and Bob Stone make this film funny, and the support and Thurber's Direction pace here are just about perfect.

1769,2639020,2014-04-02,Sickcess,Violent Shit (1989),6.0,"And yes, to state it clearly, this movie is exactly what the title says. This movie is about K. the butcher shitter, who walks around in the countryside and in the forest killing people, coupled with two scenes I guess showing how his abusive mother made him into a psycho killer. And that pretty much sums it all up.Before I begin the trashing, I want to say that I actually liked this movie, and would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate no-budget splatter, who can look past all the blunders made by Schnaas and appreciate the violence, the effort and all Schnaas' contributions to German low budget gore.Yes, there is a huge amount of gore in this movie, but the fx is so bad (somewhat creative however) that there is no way to take it seriously. Also there is a huge weirdness factor in this film. Like the scene where K. is a child where there is some random demon guy who talks to him while he is locked in the basement, a scene where K. find a crucified Christ in the woods and decides to crawl into his stomach and maybe weirdest of all, a more than three minute scene of just looking through the windshield of a car while driving on a small dirt road in nighttime, while a bad heavy metal song is played in the background. To ad to the weirdness, you would expect there to be some comedy in a film where the name of the lead is K. the butcher shitter. There is none. There is also some weird image filter used sometimes, which makes the image grainy and the framing choppy (I don't know what the effect is called, but the movement looks kind of like a slow stroboscope), which is just plain annoying and serves no purpose whatsoever. Schnaas also clearly knew nothing about editing and camera work since almost every scene has confusing changes in perspective and the cutting is many times abominably bad (remember, this is Schnaas' first movie and he has bettered himself since).So why would I still recommend this film? First of all, is's extremely violent and just for that I think it's worth seeing. If you can look past how bad all the gore looks, there is plenty to spare. You will never get bored, because the violent scenes are extremely frequent throughout the movie. Also, the weirdness doesn't have to be a bad thing. It is actually quite funny. Also, even though he didn't speak one word, I liked K. the butcher shitter, as he is quite freaky. Furthermore Schnaas is a guy who clearly is passionate about what he is doing, and every gore hound should appreciate that. So this is a really bad film, but it's a fun bad film.

In fact most of these movies have not even appeared on TV. RKO Radio's ""Frail Women"" (made in 1931, released in early 1932) is a case in point. The movie is set in 1914 when women of virtue sacrificed everything for love of the men who were going off to fight in the First World War. Why? Simply because the women felt that they too should make a sacrifice, and it was the biggest thing they could do for the men who were going off to fight for their country and would most probably never return. Mary Newcomb plays such a woman. She bears a daughter who is now a teenager in the movie, played by Margaret Vines. To add another screw to the story, the daughter has been adopted by a man (played by Athole Stewart) who didn't know the girl was illegitimate. And to add yet a further complication, the man's son wants to marry the girl!

This movie does provide, however, a good example of how the advertising for a film can deviate from what the film actually offers. One of the posters for ""Badlands of Montana"" prominently features -- in gaudy color -- a drawing of a shirtless man standing outdoors, hands tied above head, writhing in pain and with an agonized expression on his face as another man, in the background, cracks a whip in a long, sinuous arc. The whip has just struck the back of the shirtless man which is already crisscrossed with bloody welt marks. ""A lash for every crime he did NOT commit!"" proclaims the ad-line.

The shirtless man is meant to be the lead actor, Rex Reason, though the drawing doesn't much resemble him, and while Reason is whipped in the movie, this scene barely corresponds to the depiction on the poster. In the movie, Reason keeps his shirt on, he's bound in a different way from that shown in the artwork, and he doesn't indulge in the writhing displayed by his advertising counterpart. What's more, he's whipped inside a barn rather than in the outdoor setting shown on the poster.

Perhaps the designers of the poster had not actually seen the completed film when doing their work and had only been told that it contained a scene of Rex Reason being flogged. Perhaps they'd viewed the scene but thought it dull and decided to liven it up. Or perhaps two different versions of the whipping were filmed and the dull version wound up in the final print. In any case, the patron who bought a ticket to ""Badlands of Montana"" on the basis of that poster must have been very disappointed.

Ironically, the scene in the movie showing Reason being whipped could easily have resembled the scene on the poster. Reason could have had his shirt pulled off prior to his punishment. After all, he had a good physique and wasn't adverse to showing it off. (Just look at all his swimsuit scenes in ""The Creature Walks Among Us."") In fact, later in ""Badlands,"" Reason does display a bit of bare torso. And there's no reason he couldn't have been tied up as shown on the poster, rather than in the view-blocking, behind-a-ladder position chosen for the cameras. And the scene could have taken place outside the barn rather than inside it.

Of a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. After a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways.The male prostitute then goes on a downward self-destructive spiral trying to find his ""one true love"", repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented, looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love.In the meanwhile, he hooks up with one ugly guy (who I thought was also a male prostitute), a gay basher, and some guy who ends up having a ""three-second sexual intercourse session"" with him in a back alley.It never ceases to amaze me how films STILL portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds, such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm! All of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them, to which he discards their telephone numbers.
There is a brief side-plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. There is also another brief side-plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window. And there is also one more brief side-plot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person.None of these things really connect with each other, only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is.

There was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the world's saddest song on it.Otherwise, this movie just seems to go on forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem very dreamlike, but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare!
I found the ending to be confusing as I wasn't quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven? That would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe. But seeing as this is an ""independent film"", movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to ""use your imagination"". 
For those of you who are seeking out nudity, there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows. In other words, don't waste your time with this one.My Rating - 2 out of 10",500,0,,0,No reference

He also pays respect to those who have moved on from this world, and to childhood memories that have left an everlasting impression.

But who can he trust? The film appears to be both absurd and over-the-top serious, and watching it you'll find yourself asking just where is it dead serious and where does satire or (self-)parody start? The slow tempo and long, brooding silences before sometimes outrageously weighted lines, the gloomy lighting and the sudden hysterical swings of the people in the film - all of this was certainly intended, but the purpose of the film is by no means clear, so the viewer has to decide for himself just what enemy Giliap is fighting or what he is searching.If you've seen ""Songs from the Second Floor"" you'll recognize some of the style - the long, slow shots, the blunt, searching or unresponsive dialog lines, the dreary, somehow naked and unprotected facial expressions.

1779,2029745,2010-10-09,Michael_Elliott,When Michael Calls (1972 TV Movie),,"When Michael Calls (1972) ** 1/2 (out of 4)Mildly effective made-for-TV flick about a woman (Elizabeth Ashley) who begins receiving phone calls from her nephew Michael but the only problem is that he died fifteen years earlier. Soon her ex-husband (Ben Gazzara) and other nephew (Michael Douglas) begin to investigate is Michael could actually be alive or if someone else is just trying to do her harm. These TV flicks from the 70s always have that certain atmosphere that can only be found in movies like this, BAD RONALD and DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK. This here certainly isn't as good as those two examples but we still get that eerie atmosphere and that alone makes this worth sitting through even if in the end this isn't a classic. I think the best thing going for the film are the performances by the three leads. Gazzara plays a lawyer who doesn't mind throwing his weight around to get what he wants and I thought he was pretty good in the role. That tough rawness he brings to all his roles is always fun to watch and he certainly helps keep this thing moving along. Ashley is also very good in the film, although it's hard to believe her as the aunt to Douglas especially when in real life she was only five years older than him. With that said, she certainly displayed a certain vulnerability that made the movie a bit more effective. Douglas is billed as a ""Special Guest Star"" but he actually has a pretty big role here and appears throughout the movie. The screenplay tries very hard to be like something you'd expect to see from Hitchcock as it tries to keep the suspense up by having you constantly guessing what's going on. I think it's pretty simple to figure out what's up after about the forty-minute mark but I'm sure some might be kept in the dark up until the ending. While I didn't fall for all the twists and turns this still turned out to be fairly fun thanks in large part to the cast and whoever it was that voiced the kid on the phone. Another good thing about these films from the 70s that dealt with phones is that they were always able to find someone creepy for the voice work.",389,0,,0,No reference

Hereafter is well acted, and in the end, quite wonderful.

It also revolves around a French Journalist named Marie(Cecil De France) who was recently in a tsunami and survived, but went into the after world for a brief period of time. And then there's Marcus, an English boy who's twin brother has recently died in a car accident.Marie wants to write a novel about her experience in the after world, but everyone is skeptical. While Marcus wants to find George and talk to his brother. All of these characters and their stories are heart wrenching.The characters are all troubled people who want to move on but just can't, and that part of the films intrigue. The build up to the climax is gripping, and the ending to Hereafter is wonderful.

1794,2725799,2014-09-13,dougdoepke,Home of the Brave (1949),,"Five soldiers are sent to map out a Japanese held island during WWII. Friction erupts when it turns out that one of the men is blackThe years 1949, 50, & 51, witnessed a spate of social conscience movies before the McCarthyite-HUAC purges put an end to them. Unfortunately, this is one of the more obscure. So far as I know, the movie's rarely been revived-- in fact, I had to order a DVD decades after first viewing. Still, the film's many moments of sheer rawness have stayed with me over time.In my book, the 90-minutes is not a complete success. I still have trouble with the psychiatrist's (Corey) facile analysis of Moss's (Edwards) problem following island combat. It's much too pat and self-assured to be convincing, more like a happy ending contrivance. Yet this Hollywood moment is more than offset by the racially charged atmosphere of the remainder. Note, for example, how the three men react to Moss on his first arrival, which sets the racial stage for what follows. Finch (Bridges) embraces his old friend; Mingo (Lovejoy) is understandably dubious; while racist TJ (Brodie) snubs the black man. Given Mingo's doubts, (understandable, given the intimate nature of the mission that now includes a racial outsider), it's really his ambivalence on which the plot pivots. Lovejoy's low-key performance makes Mingo easy to overlook. Yet, it's really Mingo's trajectory that delivers the movie's ultimate message. I'm with those who think Lovejoy steals the movie in his own mild way.But get a load of that jungle. It's creepy enough to suck the air out of a dirigible. Anyone like Finch who goes into that maw shouldn't expect to come out. At this point in his career Bridges was one of the most interesting actors around. Always virile and athletic, he's a nice guy here. Yet, catch him in the noir classic The Sound of Fury (1950). There he's egotistical and mean-spirited in totally convincing fashion. Too bad the bulk of his later career, following communist allegations, was spent within the confines of serial TV.Of course, the movie's mainly remembered for James Edwards' role as a young dignified black man. I think we'd have to go back to Paul Robeson in the 1930's to find a similar black-man persona. Unfortunately, African-Americans were consigned to buffoonish or menial roles during the period. But here, Edwards presents a movie star appearance in a difficult role. His Peter Moss is proud and dignified one moment, yet confused and vulnerable the next. All of which befits an educated outsider in uncertain surroundings. Clearly, there's a laudable effort to deal with the effects racism has on a victim's internal dynamics. Thus, the narrative was an unusual Hollywood attempt at racial honesty, but one that was unfortunately cut short-- after all, the US couldn't fight a cold war by airing its dirty linen to the world. Anyway, thanks reviewer CeOTIS for filling in some facts about Edwards. Clearly, he was suited for Poitier or Belafonte type roles, but I guess his associations with lefties consigned him to the fringes. A genuine loss.The movie itself manages to rivet interest despite its stage origins. The few sets are confining. Still that has the effect of concentrating the drama. Plus, the fact that we never see the enemy lends an even more unsettling atmosphere. The sudden use of the epithet 'nigger' is jolting to contemporary ears. And especially so, when the easy-going Finch under pressure begins to mouth the word. Then we get an idea of how embedded skin color is in the general culture. Seems to me, however, some latitude should be granted to the lack of combat realism that other reviewers use to criticize. After all, the movie's not really a war movie. Instead, it's a social conscience film using wartime conditions to illuminate conditions at home. Note, however, that the script lays the blame for race prejudice on the individual, that is, unless I missed something. That way more explosive topics like politics or the economy are finessed.Anyway, viewers who appreciate this film should catch up with other racial films of that pregnant period. Let me recommend—Intruder in the Dust (1950); Lost Boundaries (1949); The Well (1951); No Way Out (1950); and Pinky (1949). Despite isolated exceptions, like The Defiant Ones (1958), movies would have to wait another 20-years before the issues would again be taken up in sustained fashion. Nonetheless, the human drama here has lost little of its power over the intervening decades. A tribute, I think, to all those involved.",754,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

Though my own childhood occurred a decade after the setting for ""A Christmas Story"", there's no mistaking the angst of a nine year old's condition awaiting the hallowed day, wondering whether a favorite gift would be waiting under the tree. The appeal of the film is timeless in it's own way, and funny in it's depiction of the foibles of youth. At about Ralphie's age, my own son tested the integrity of the old tongue on the pole trick, fortunately to no serious outcome as the rest of the family was watching from inside the house during Christmas dessert. Grandpa to the rescue with a cup of warm water, thereby saving the fire department an inconvenient trip down the road.

Attempting to answer the question of whether Santa Claus is real or not would probably have been too overt a theme for the picture, so the movie's take on the loss of youthful innocence is handled a bit differently. That Ovaltine scene when Ralphie deciphers the radio message with his Little Orphan Annie secret decoder pin is one of the best put downs ever of the season's crass commercialism.

All of the story's little vignettes work in capturing the innocence and wonder of a simpler era, from standing up to the neighborhood bully to the 'shoot your eye out' mentality of over anxious mother hens with their precocious children. Somehow I managed to sidestep the taste testing effects of Lux, Palmolive and Lifebuoy, but most of the rest of the picture evoked the fond memories of a childhood growing up in a small town with the kind of issues faced by Ralphie and his buddies. I even remember a friend's first use of the 'F' word, mispronouncing it in an attempt to make it sound less vulgar and offensive than it was.

Just recently, I read about the renovation and opening of the original Christmas Story house in downtown Cleveland where the movie was made. A separate museum across the street is home to memorabilia from the film, though the 'leg lamp' is prominently displayed in the window of the house as it appeared in the film. Funny how a film can change one's perception of things; I now always hear the word pronounced 'fra-gee-lay'.

Of course, every Christmas now the movie is shown in marathon sessions on cable, this year TBS won the honors. Because it's been so easily accessible, I've disregarded it the last few years, but decided to watch it start to finish today in a burst of holiday nostalgia.

1799,3171365,2016-10-30,Daviteo,Lazer Team (2015),7.0,"I'm a longtime Rooster Teeth fan so I gave the movie a 7 to bolster the review and for the effort. The actual score would be lower if I weren't familiar with the people behind the movie, and the reason for this comes down to one main problem: they bit off more than they could handle, especially with only a $2.5 million budget. That might seem like a lot but for what they were trying to accomplish, that's infinitesimal. So the effort and dedication of the film team is what bolsters my score to a 7.Another issue with the film is the humor, which is sometimes hit or miss. Humor always needs to come organically and unfortunately there were times that it seemed very forced here for the sake of a joke. When it landed, often with he case of Gavin's character, it's because it's a character himself is just ""being himself"" and that ends up being quite funny. In the future, if there's a joke, a mini-story should be built around it to make sure they audience will buy everything about the setup and delivery, because I could easily see people not going along with each gag in this film.I'm looking forward to more films from RT but I would issue three cautions:On your next film, scale it back. If you have $2 million, make a $2 million movie. This movie, with all the people, props, effects, and scope is a much larger-budgeted film with a smaller budget than it needed and I think that's where a lot of the negative comments on here stem from. I hope that, if they get two or three million again for their next film, they scale the scope down to something that's tighter, stronger, and a bit more believable. If it's a comedy, I would hope that it's something that lands each and every joke and that's told with believable acting. I also hope that their next film is NOT Lazerteam 2 ... yet. I think that a film like that would be great as a third or fourth film, but I sincerely hope they scale the scope back and use a large budget to focus on really sticking the landing for acting, humor, and effects for each part of that.Lazerteam was made in big part by and for the fans and because of that there was sort of a safety net—the fans, myself included, laughed at a lot of the in-jokes and actors that I've grown to know on the various podcasts and YouTube videos, but for someone who has no idea who the RT folks are or what the community is about, I could see them feeling that this isn't a very good movie. I hope that RT's next film strays from this and makes a very solid movie that's ""for the theater,"" or ""for everyone who pays for a ticket."" In other words, I hope that they go into the next film with a ""cold audience"" in mind, an audience that is unfamiliar with anything that's been done in the past or anything that has to do with the community.Third, to restate, with the budget they had they tried making a $10 million or $20 million movie and it pulled the final product down. I've learned this the hard way on films I've made until I finally found a balance between budget and what one can realistically pull off, and Lazerteam ultimately suffered because of this, and I really hope their next film doesn't.In short, I really want these folks to succeed and a lot of the criticism I feel, and I'm usually really good at judging this, is because of the three factors above. Lazerteam was a very honest and impressive effort at an Olympic-level routine while only being a very talented college-level gymnast. I hope they train hard and focus a bit more on a tighter story, characters, dialogue, jokes, and have less effects on their next effort so that instead of being wobbly and having to regain their balance because they almost tumble, they're able to stick the landing and have a product that works for ALL audiences, not just Rooster Teeth fans.",697,1,,0,No reference
1800,1325894,2006-11-07,markperk123,The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning (2006 Video Game),,"Short.

And too dang many invisible walls.

The flying levels were poorly executed rail shooters- shouldn't have been included.

11/7/2006 That is one of very few negative things I could say about this latest Spyro iteration that came out just a couple of weeks ago.

It is what I wanted to see the Gamecube do to Spyro.

Myself and my wife have been playing Spyro faithfully since his birth on the ps1. We thoroughly enjoyed his outings until, The XBOX/Gamecube/PS2 generation came along. We were sure that the XBOX-esquire rendering made capable by our Gamecube were going to show us what Spyro really was meant to be. But, alas, they were terrible.

What poor excuses those games were, and with such a great license...

So, I have been waiting a couple of years now for a good Spyro game to emerge from all this newer gen technology. Both attempts on the Gamecube have been pretty miserable- the framerate dipping so low at times that you felt embarrassed to be playing it at times. The unfinished feel of them was so hard to ignore, that it made playing it an almost uncomfortable experience. I continued playing them just in the hope that maybe the next level would be done by a better designer, with better graphics or smoother running because it was more thoroughly built. It never came.

So we waited, until I walked into GameStop here in Las Vegas, trading in some old games, hoping my eye would fall upon something inspired in the used games section. It took me about 30 second or so when I saw it- the bright blue image of a new Spyro game in the Gamecube area! Wow! I snatched it up at once, with a truly neat surprise for my wife.

The Legend Of Spyro- A New Beginning.

Wow! This was more than I could have hoped! We were nuts about the old Spyro, and the box looked great! We got it home, put it in, and it fired right up with beautiful graphics, perfectly smooth in the engine it was running on, and an opening demo that blew my out of my seat! This Spyro was something completely new...that much was clear.

This is an evolved Spyro with devastating attacks, at some points going practically nuclear in their visually devastating, camera shaking glory.

Holy cow! The controls operated so beautifully too... this was gorgeous and responsive too... wow... great start! I loved it... the tutorials you go through are filled with ""The Legend of Spyro"" back story that was wonderful to hear... a ton of time was put into the story of Spyro's place in the history of dragondom, and the world he is an important part of. After all, a purple dragon is only born but once in 2000 years, and he is the answer to the prophecy told throughout the ages.

It was very cool to learn so much about one of our favorite platformer stars! It was so detailed and amazing that I just couldn't wait to see what it would develop into after the tutorials.

That, my friends, is the killer.

The crushing blow hit. You get to learn your 4th skill element, get trained in it's 3 variations, and you get ready to rock some wild new spyro worlds... right??? Then- DAMMIT! You go after Cinder (the Dark ""lordress"" of this game) for about an hour or so, defeat her, then No-Way! CREDITS! It was ramping up so amazingly into what surely would have been a blockbuster game, but POOF! You make it to the end of the tutorial, and this games over! You can go through it all in probably 12 hours, probably less.

Great tutorial... no game.

I just hope that this is a precursor to a massive, 30 world upcoming next gen game that will have made this game truly worth it.

I give it a 7 out of 10 due to length.

8.75 on it's merits alone. 1/2 point deduction for the flying levels.

It really is a good game.

Especially if you love Spyro.

They didn't have a single meaningful dialogue but this was somehow enough to make someone who has decided to live their life on the road to give her search for her long lost father and live in some random town where she hates the people at her work. (Also why do they never discuss any actual price specifics on the car, I feel like someone who live own the road for that long would be money conscious and where the f*** did she get money to afford that other house she bought). The whole art gala scene and Chuck becoming her father were the dumbest movie twists I've seen in years. At least Camilla Belle was cute only thing that kept me watch.

1805,3533327,2018-03-10,Michael Fargo,Mozart in the Jungle (2014–2018),10.0,"I came late to this series and have just finished binge-watching 4 seasons. The cast is one of the attractions here, but New York is the other. A lot of the grit behind the scenes of the world of classical music has been scrubbed. Show me an oboist that resides in an apartment like the superb Debra Monk's. A lot of the eccentricity of classical musicians is also tamed, but there's Malcolm McDowell delightfully representing that contingency as well as Gael Garcia Bernal who both make the madness of musicians more attractive than it actually is. The camaraderie is also put forward, and the jealousies and back-biting shoved in the wings. What's left is a series full of Romanticism, mysticism and the thrill that classical music can bring. A brief segment showing the children's orchestra sawing out Beethoven's 5th is the more familiar experience we have in concert halls. This is a show that puts classic music on the altar it deserves, omitting the sacrifice and hard work that produces it. It makes us believe that all of us could raise a baton transport ourselves and an audience to Nirvana, and that's okay with me. 
As well, the production itself is superb. When we leave New York for Venice, Mexico and Japan, nothing is lost. But there's nothing better than watching Bernadette Peters strutting through the Guggenheim like she owns the place (she owns just about any space she inhabits). And spending time in Venice with Ana Maria Martinez is all too brief but the farewell episode with her floating on a barge down the canals of Venice to collide with Placido Domingo was epic.
I was smitten by Lola Kirke's awkward portrayal of Hailey Rutledge. But compared to Bernal's extravagant performance, as well as the rest of the cast (peppered with New York's glitterati), she gets a little lost in the swirling magic that producers Coppola, Schwartzman, et al., have bravely assembled.

1807,724900,2004-02-05,scharnbergmax-se,The Collector (1965),9.0,"This is not a review of the movie. It is a HALF review. I shall say the bare minimum about the male' side. The extensive interest of a young boy, Freddie, is collecting butterflies. Although he is an amateur, his great knowledge is respected by professional entomologists. Freddie is secretly in love with an art student, Miranda. But he is too shy to attempt a normal approach. When he wins a lot of money, he buys a lonely country estate, and transforms the cellar of the annex into a comfortable and rather large room, though without windows. In turn, he chloroforms and kidnaps Miranda and locks her up in the annex. He imagines that if she gets to know him, she might fall in love with him. After a few weeks he says with rage: You COULD fall in love with me if you tried. You just DON'T TRY.' After a month Miranda gets the opportunity to hit his head with a shovel. But he manages to lock her up before he goes to a hospital. While he is away for some days, the warming apparatus in the annex breaks down. Miranda becomes ill and dies. - This is the half part of the movie about which I shall say very little. Clearly, something is wrong with Freddie's mind. And his subsequent logical reflections', assessing the pros and cons whether Miranda's death was his fault or not, reveals the credit writer's insight into some kinds of mental diseases. Moreover, the situation into which Miranda is thrown is so distant from ordinary experience, that normal people cannot be expected to act in a perfectly rational manner. Miranda tries out many strategies. But it must have been manifest to Freddie that she never takes any step, until every less costly step has failed. - - - Henceforth I shall turn to the female' part and, in particular, to aspects that may easily be overlooked. Even before Miranda was kidnapped she had certain hypocritical attitudes, which prevented more adequate strategies. I entertain no illusion that Miranda could easily have got herself released. But it was indeed in her power to refrain from making things worse. She felt contempt for such people as Freddie, and would have demonstrated her contempt if he had approached her in a normal way. When he eventually showed her his impressive collection of butterflies, her only reaction was that he was an abhorrent mass murderer. She was overwhelmed with pity with one single butterfly in a glass that was not yet dead, and she begged Freddie to release it. However, her own father was a medical doctor. And whatever our ethical evaluation, a very large part of medical science and contemporary medical research involve extremely painful experiments on animals. If Freddie was cruel to hundreds of butterflies, what was Miranda's father to millions of vertebrates? Probably her fundamental ethical rule was that whatever is kept out of view, is kept out of ethics. Do professors of entomology constitute a specific category of scoundrels? At a time when Freddie had promised to release Miranda at a certain date, and when she seems to have believed him, she said with genuine kindness: `I do wish you would come to London. This [= the life Freddie is living now, alone and with one special interest] is death.' With less hypocrisy Miranda might have understood that her kidnapper would be seriously wounded, if she depreciated his deepest interest and greatest skill. In fact, the event when he showed her his butterfly collection was the first emergence of anything external to the prisoner-and-guard-relation. Miranda worked with the beauty of colour and form of art, and Freddie worked with the beauty of colour and form of nature. Here was one topic about which both could talk in reciprocal respect. If Miranda had been a more skilled strategist, she might even have said: Why didn't you think of making a photo of some of your boxes, and post them to me and ask if I would like to see your entire collection and maybe paint some of the butterflies?' And, truthfully or not, she might have added: I would have come. Definitely.' - Elsewhere in the movie Miranda makes another big strategic flop. She assures Freddie that he could read Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye', understand the book, and discuss it with Miranda's usual friends. He does read it, but their subsequent discussion ends with Miranda reproaching Freddie for rejecting the book just because you cannot understand it'. And when his desperation grows because of his incapacity of communicating with Miranda, Freddie finally says: You see, I was right in bringing you here. We could never have made friends outside.' Now, I happen to be highly acquainted with Novels, poems, and dramas. But I think that Miranda's perception of Salinger's book is sheer nonsense, while I would have no difficulty in discussing the book with Freddie. If Salinger's aim was to depict an exceptional boy who cannot help being the way he is because of some endocrine disease, I might have felt sorry for him. Perhaps even his flagrant intolerance could be excused, despite his own dire need of tolerance from others. But I see no personal charm in his intolerance. Nor can I find any trace that he hates everything that is false'. And if Salinger intended to illustrate how similar this boy is to all human beings in not fitting anywhere, Salinger has failed miserably. - - - Formally the movie could be called a horror film. But contemporary users will hardly be upset by so little horror; they may profit more from focusing on the psychological interaction. In the 1960s a gasp pervaded the entire audience in the ultimate scene, when it becomes clear that Freddie is preparing for kidnapping a certain other girl. No such reaction emerged when I saw the movie two years ago. - - - Special admiration deserves the butterfly-thin music, mostly played on a zither, but nevertheless highly threatening.",1002,0,,0,No reference
1808,2127117,2011-05-18,Bunuel1976,The Eve of St. Mark (1944),7.0,"A good war drama adapted by George Seaton from a literate Maxwell Anderson play is given the typical Fox polish and an experienced director to counter a cast peppered with new young talent (notably Anne Baxter, William Eythe, Michael O'Shea, Henry Morgan and Vincent Price).Of course, the film was intended as a morale-booster but, thankfully, the propaganda element (usually abetted by racist jibes) is kept at bay here; on the contrary, it strives to depict the characters as normal human beings who are thrust into extraordinary and often painful situations. Still, the expected doses of comedy (supplied by O'Shea) and romance (not only does country-boy Eythe become engaged to neighbor Baxter, but the whole gang gets to entertain a couple of lonely bar-room girls once in uniform) are present and accounted for; incidentally, it is odd seeing Price (looking quite youthful and serving as the butt of his buddies' jokes for his cerebral superiority being offset by perennial pennilessness!) amid this environment.The last act involves the war action proper, and even this is largely taken up by two of the men (Price included)'s bouts with malaria; the finale, then, sees the squad who had been cornered in a cave effect a fortuitous escape by sea (apparently, the ending of the original play was more downbeat)followed by the voluntary conscription of Eythe's younger brother.

1809,3230838,2017-02-07,sbsieber,Mother's Day (I) (2016),1.0,"This is one of those movies that doesn't have a script so much as talking points. Actors do a lot of mugging and spluttering in an attempt to emote and say words at the same time, and it doesn't always work. Jennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson are the worst offenders. These are actors who need a solid script with real words, or they just go off on tangents that look like exaggerated improv-class hamming. Aniston throwing a fit in her car is some of the worst acting I have seen on film in a long time; it was an embarrassment. Here is a wonderful comedic actress who has been given little to work with and no direction, and it shows. The scene where she goes off on her husband's new wife at a children's pageant is cringe-worthy, and only serves to make her character unappealing - who does she think she is to think that she has the right to reserve a chair in the front row just for her purse?In general, the acting is awful, and cartoonish. Even dependable veterans like Margo Martindale come off looking bad. She and her on- screen husband portray ignorant ""trailer trash"" in a way that is an insult to the audience's intelligence and to all people living in trailers everywhere; seeing the husband driving his RV while simultaneously sucking on a macerated chicken bone was one of the more egregious ham-fisted attempts at characterization in this movie, of which there are many. The extreme lop-sided hairstyle of the gay character is another example, as is her contribution of a ""womb"" float to the Mother's Day parade (although in this day of ""pussy protests"", perhaps not.) The action scene with the womb float chasing the trailer (for no apparent good reason) at dangerously high speeds through a highly populated town centre was wildly annoying as was the over-the-top backyard party scene with the large blow-up ""bouncy"" slide that deflates to comedic (NOT) hysteria. It's all just bad, bad, bad. I could go on, but I think I make my point. This is a movie that has too many moving parts, where everyone lives in a brightly coloured, high intensity cartoon world. There is too much pointless action, and mind-numbing dialogue that is obviously improvised by actors who really don't understand their characters.

Borat, one of the three characters from Cohen's Da Ali G Show, is a completely naive and moronic character that Cohen plays with so much conviction that it's actually scary. One even wonders whether Cohen is a genius or a madman.

Borat is directed by Larry Charles, whose previous efforts were the disappointing Bob Dylan vehicle, Masked and Anonymous, and several episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. All these projects had major creative input by their respective stars, Bob Dylan, and Larry David, as does his new film.

Shot in a mockumentary-style, the film chronicles Kazakh reporter Borat and his overweight producer (Ken Davitian) in their adventures in the ""U.S. and A."" They are sent to create a documentary about our globalizing culture. However, Borat quickly falls in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing her on a rerun of Baywatch, and the plot ultimately turns into Borat's quest to California to marry Anderson. What's interesting is that Cohen, a Jew, is actually speaking a combination of Hebrew and Yiddish with a Polish accent in his subtitled mumblings. The film's plot is very weak. However, it's extremely doubtful that anyone in the audience would actually care, as they would be too busy laughing hysterically.

Cohen finds humor in the reactions of everyday people in response to Borat's antics and candid inquiries. Cohen seems to never stop, as the movie is basically funny the whole way through. Cohen and Charles even accomplish the unthinkable in this film by creating sympathy for such a repulsive and clueless character. Completely broke, lonely and out of gas, Borat creates a fire for himself outside a building, and one actually feels sorry for him. Though Borat appears like such a despicable character, in reality, he is far too moronic to hate.

Cohen might actually be making a statement concerning racism with this film, because beyond his tongue-in-cheek shtick, Borat unknowingly reveals what kinds of people are actually out there, the nice, along with the bigots and sexists.

Even Borat himself proclaims he hates gays and Jews, but it becomes apparent that he has never even met either until his voyage into America. The bottom line is, no matter how stupid the plot is, and how politically incorrect it may be, this movie is completely hilarious all the way through.",414,0,,0,No reference

Gotham City: dark, dangerous, 'protected' only by a mostly corrupt police department. Despite the best efforts of D.A. Harvey Dent and police commissioner Jim Gordon, the city becomes increasingly unsafe...until a Dark Knight arises. We all know criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot...so his disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. He becomes a bat. Enter Vicky Vale, a prize-winning photo journalist who wants to uncover the secret of the mysterious ""bat-man"". And enter Jack Napier, one-time enforcer for Boss Grissom, horribly disfigured after a firefight in a chemical factory...who, devoid of the last vestiges of sanity, seizes control of Gotham's underworld as the psychotic, unpredictable Clown Prince of Crime...the Joker. Gotham's only hope, it seems, lies in this dark, brooding vigilante. And just how does billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne fit into all of this?

While the film is titled 'Batman', it's quite a shock to see Tim Burton commit a high amount of running time to the villain of the picture, in the form of the Joker. These sections seem to be more of a showcase of Jack Nicholson's comedic talents than anything to do with the story, and a star vehicle is the last think 'Batman' should have been. Thankfully, Nicholson himself is more than worthy of the challenge of tackling the disturbed, almost pantomimic Joker. Rarely descending into ham, Nicholson simply owns the frame. However, Michael Keaton is also good as the Caped Crusader, and convinces as a normal guy...a rarity in superhero movies.

The opening sequence is too plain. Compared to Hollywood blockbusters, who had very striking opening sequences with too much graphics. I felt pity for for the French ambassadors family who was blown away in a truck just like that. & WORSE, at end part was like, ""THAT'S IT??"" What I only like is the character of the villain Anthony Chapel. His personality & the way he talk is pretty annoying. But it suits better for the movie. Steven Seagal was my favorite martial arts superstar. But it shows in 2006, he already grown old & gone bloated.

1821,3287283,2017-04-29,prabhunster,Ichi (2008),8.0,"In all honesty, the original reason I decided to watch this movie was the keywords, ""Blind Swordsman."" in the synopsis. I envisioned a film about epic sword fights and superhuman feats. This is one case where I was glad that I was wrong.Don't get me wrong, there are still enough (well-choreographed) fight scenes to entertain the average joe. But the fight scenes are by no means the bulk of the movie. I appreciated that the fight scenes were deliberate, that is, each specific fight was justified with reasoning behind it, whether it be a plot device to further the story or give some small insight to a character's past. There wasn't any fighting' for the sake of fighting'The wandering protagonist, Ichi, is a Goze (a blind woman who barely scrapes by, working as a wandering musician). Unbeknownst to most, she also happens to be a master swordsman of unknown origin. All we see is a laconic, emotionally repressed young lady who has found one singular purpose in life, a journey of sorts. Although she tries to avoid conflict with others, she also is willing to maim/kill anyone without hesitation or regret if they obstruct her path or pose a threat. She takes neither pride nor shame in killing, but she doesn't lack morality. It may just appear that way since her persona is buried so deep that she appears to be a hollow/soulless shell at times. Although undesired, she carries a certain allure about her which attracts attention.. A blind swordswoman with such exceptional skills is enough to make anyone curious/scared.Although the movie may sound very dark, the theme is well-balanced with an appropriate amount of humor. This is due to the introduction of a good-hearted, but overly confident man, Toma, who joins Ichi on her quest. Toma recognizes Ichi's amazing fighting skill and feels some sense of emasculation. He claims to be ""quite the swordsman"" himself but his demonstrated technique says otherwise, The characters play well off of each other, given their extremely polarized personalities. It allows for the occasional playful moment in an otherwise serious and dramatic movie,Throughout their journey, Ichi and Toma learn about each other, as well about themselves. The overriding themes of character development, self-realization, and overcoming one's inner demons are the true essence of the movie. That said, their journey has its ups and downs but due as a series of events unfolds, they quickly find their lives more and more in the balance, building to an amazing climax. Overall, I really liked the movie. It's common knowledge that this premise is not original, but the form it takes is what makes this movie special. At times, it's both easy and difficult to relate to Ichi, but once you hear her full story, you'll likely gain some perspective into this flawed but beautiful person. A rare, delicate flower which will eventually bloom into something amazingly breathtaking. And yet, this flower is also capable of death, unbeknownst to many. When a flower is at conflict with itself, what will happen when you approach it?",509,0,,0,No reference
1822,2207952,2011-11-20,dpfacialfan,Beast (2001 Video),8.0,"I liked this porno movie. Or more accurately, I liked the sex scenes in this porno movie. I was kind of surprised that I liked the sex scenes as much as I did, because this looked like it could be a terrible movie. It looked like it could be one of those weird fetish porno movies with crazy outfits, that is shot in some really stylish way which totally ruins every scene. Well, thank god that wasn't the case.

I must say that the scenes were shot with some good angles and I really liked the fact that they didn't show too many close ups. The lesbian scene could have used more lighting and the last scene had some shots with too bright lights, but other than that there wasn't much technical misses. All the girls that perform in this movie are also very hot, especially Jessica Drake and Miko Lee. One thing that bothered me was that pretty much every scene felt a little short. But that is a sign that the scene was really enjoyable.

Out of the scenes in this movie, the one with Maya Divine was absolutely the weakest. Maya is a good performer and I've seen a few good scenes with her, but here they have covered up her beautiful body, or should I say tits, with some kind of dress. The scene was still watchable, but could have been better. The other scene that I had a problem with was the one with April Flowers. Once again this girl is in a condom scene. I recently watched the movie ""Wild Pair"" were she was ""fucking"" Lee Stone with a condom. Well here she ""fucks"" him again with a condom. I don't know what it is, because I've seen this chick do guys without a condom, so it can't be that. And Lee Stone bangs chicks many times without a condom, so I just don't get it. Well, at least the director does a good job with the camera and mostly shoots it from a distance, so that way the condom doesn't show as clearly. On the plus side I must say that I once again enjoyed April's oral skills. It's not every girl that can deep throat a dick like that. Most women would have a lot to learn from this chick. The ""fucking"" was also quite good in this scene. Too bad that the guy watching didn't join in, because I would have really enjoyed to see this girl get DP:ed.

This movie stars the beautiful and sexy Jessica Drake. And this was shot back when Jessica was in her prime. Although we get to see Jessica in hot action in two scenes, I felt a little disappointed. Both scenes were good scenes but as I said before they were really short. I feel like Jessica didn't get to shine as much as she should have. In the first scene Jessica has sex with Ava Vincent (Jewel Valmont). Ava mostly gives spectacular performances in lesbian scenes and this is no exception. It seems like this girl enjoys pussy more than cock. The problem with this scene is that it doesn't show much of Jessica's hot body. The scene mostly shows Ava and her body. The reason for that is that the scene only has Jessica pleasuring Ava, but never Ava pleasuring Jessica. The scene starts with Jessica giving Ava a licking and then show her with a ""strap on"", which Ava sucks before Jessica ""fucks"" her with it. The other scene with Jessica has her once again ""fucking"" her real life partner back then, Evan Stone. This scene is a good one despite the fact that it doesn't show Jessica sucking cock until after the cumshot when she cleans it up. I really liked the shots of Jessica riding Evan Stone's big cock in the cowgirl position. They show us some nice shots from the front, instead of the back. I've always preferred the shot from the front because that's when you see the girls body and facial expressions at the same time. It's a real shame that this is a angle seldom used in hardcore porno movies. Another treat with this scene was that it shows Jessica taking Evan's big cock up her tight ass. I haven't seen this girl in too many scenes were she takes it up her ass. I've not seen her newer movies but at least in the old ones it's not something she does on a daily bases. Jessica's ass looks really tight and Evan is really gentle with it. But at the end he sticks it a little rougher in her ass and Jessica really seems to enjoy it.

The biggest surprise with this movie however, was how Miko Lee totally stole the show. This girl was in two scenes and both scenes were good, especially the first one. In the first one she's dressed up as a catholic schoolgirl who totally dominates the guy she's having sex with. I really like her nasty insults and dirty talk throughout the scene. There really isn't much scenes like this in mainstream porn were the girl totally dominates the guy and has her way with him, and that's really sad, because I really enjoy them. Miko had great energy in the scene and I really liked her in the cowgirl position as well. In the second scene she has sex with a guy in a dirty bathroom with Jessica in charge of the show. Here she plays a more submissive role and she nails it once again. It was great to see Miko in the reverse cowgirl position in this scene. It really gave Miko a chance to once again show off her spectacular body. I've not seen many scenes with Miko, but the ones I've seen I've really enjoyed. I must say that she's one of my top 5 Asian porn stars and probably one of the most underrated porn stars of all time.",997,0,,0,No reference
1823,330213,2001-09-03,steelcorpfilms,The House by the Cemetery (1981),6.0,"After watching this movie a second time, I understood more but I was still left with one word to describe it after it was done.  Huh?  I'm not sure if much of anything in this movie makes any sense whatsoever, but then again, that's one of it's good qualities in my opinion.All through the movie, it seems as if every character has at least one deep, dark secret they're hiding, but none of the secrets ever actually come out. I think that's where this movie went wrong; it had a bunch of really good, yet pointless, plot setups and no real follow through.  Even the main plot seemed to be hastily thrown together at the last minute.It seems as if this movie was just an excuse to kill off a handful of people in particularly gruesome ways while trying as hard as it can to confuse the shit out of the audience.  Now that brings me to this flick's best aspect, the gore.  As usual, Fulci's gore effects are great, with tons of blood and no shying away from the violence.  There were one or two shots that looked incredibly real.The acting was pretty cheesy, especially the family's son, Bob.  Man, could that kid scream like a little girl (no offense to any little girls out there).  Wouldn't have surprised me if my ears were bleeding by the end of the movie.Biggest technical problem I saw was the music.  Don't get me wrong, the music itself was eerie and creepy and great.  The thing was that right in the middle of a scene, or even right in the middle of a dramatic part of a scene, it would just cut out and the movie would be dead silent (except for Bob's screams, of course).Would've given it a lower rating, but the gore was really good, and I happen to like flicks that make absolutely no sense.  If you're in the mood to be really confused without the hope of resolution and you want to see some good gore, check this flick out.",342,0,,0,No reference
1824,3269263,2017-04-02,arturolawyer,The Admiral (2015),9.0,"I award this movie only nine stars because nothing man-made, including this review, has been proved to be perfect so far. But ""Admiral"" is as close to perfection as it gets. Frank Lammers, cast as Michiel de Ruyter, is up to this challenging role. He leads the fleet of the Dutch Republic, a confederation of seven often quarreling provinces or states, against the powerful fleet of the British empire. He is an inspiring commander and a doting husband and father. He is a military tactician of the first order and a soldier's soldier. The lovely Sanne Langelar, cast as his wife and as the mother of his three children, has just as much integrity and valor as he does. When in the middle of the night a multitudinous, violent mob bent on destruction swarms around the home where she lives with her children, she confronts them alone, wearing no greater protection than a nightgown. The supporting cast is outstanding and works well together to bring alive a dynamic period of Dutch history. The Republic's success in naval warfare didn't discourage her opponents, who combined against her. This turning of events is the tragic background for the convincing performance of Barry Atsma, cast as Johan de Witt, the ""Grand Pensioner"" of the Republic. He poignantly portrays the transient nature of success and its dangers. Under his stewardship, the Republic scored victories against the British crown. While he earned a measure of satisfaction, those victories bred factionalism and resentment at home. As de Witt, Atsma journeys from consummate optimism to soul-crushing self doubt. His loathsome end tinged with the stench of betrayal comes when the frontiers of the Republic buckle under the combined assault of her massed enemies. Lieke Van Lexmond is sumptuously seductive and wholesome in the role of his wife, Wendela. Egbert Jan Weeber, cast as Willem III, proves himself up to the demands of his ""anti- hero"" role, which requires him to be principled, conniving, and remorseful at different points. Charles Dance portrays British monarch Charles II as the avatar or British power, supremely disdainful towards anyone opposed to his designs, proving that he enjoyed a degree of impunity that de Witt, who was one defeat removed from being lynched, sorely lacked. Discussing the work of all the others who made the film possible would add excessive length to this review, whose point is pretty straightforward: go watch the movie!I'm sure that the true story of how a small nation like Holland survived and prospered in Europe is rich, complex, and full of lessons.

1825,1822064,2009-06-27,roedyg,Minority Report (2002),10.0,"I long ignored this movie because of the title. ""The Minority Report"" sounded as exciting as a documentary on the decline of General Motors from an accountant's point of view.This a brilliant movie. It is a tour de force of the imagination. It reminded me of Blade Runner -- a gritty, thoughtful, believable vision of the future, casually laid out in great detail in much the way a drama about the old west would be handled. It is not just a few gimmicks. It creates a complete world, complete with shopping malls, advertising, office buildings, gardens, airports, cars, elevators...The scene when Cruise gets new eyes is pure little-boy Spielberg, grossing out his younger sister with an unlimited budget.

1826,2937176,2015-09-12,tyler_castro,We Bare Bears (2014–2019),10.0,"Firstly, I would like to say that Cartoon Network is one of the best programs right now when it comes to children's entertainment. We Bare Bears, Steven Universe, and Over the Garden Wall (even if it is a mini-series) are prime examples of what this channel is capable of doing.Regarding this particular show, this is probably the funniest cartoon show I've seen in a long while. And I mean LONG while. It revolves around three anthropomorphic bears who try to blend in with human society. We have Grizz, the leader of the trio and the oldest, who is a loud and enthusiastic character who has a lot of heart. What I like about him is that he shows pure and genuine care for his friends, on top of his humorous love for everything. Sure, he is comical most of the time, but his character shines brightest when he asks questions in worry and concern (""Are they bullying you?"" and ""Are we in the way of you making friends?"" are some examples of his sincere kindness, where he isn't loudly speaking).Next we have Panda, who is the middle-sibling. Panda is very shy and to himself, and is in most cases the voice-of-reason. He often spends his time on his phone, for he is obsessed with social media. Panda is also very, very silly. He is the most childish out of the group, and is treated like the youngest a good portion of the time. He is the sweet one, and his innocent and shy nature toward things make him the most adorable. Plus, a lot of people can relate to his love of manga and online-dating. He is a surprisingly realistic character.Finally we have Ice Bear, the youngest. Ice Bear is the odd one out of the bunch, speaking in a monotone voice, and exclusively in third person. Now, when it comes to shows like this, there is always the odd one. Most of the time, cartoon shows make this character outright random, or stupid. But with Ice Bear, as far as these characters go, got it out of the park. Ice Bear is silent, sure, but he is also very caring with his friends, much like Grizz. Also, while he doesn't show that much emotion in his words, he does feel emotions. There are scenes where he is downright angry, and scenes where he has a giant smile on his face. He isn't a weird funny statue. There is room for a lot of character development in him, as well as the two others. What this show does right is combining humor and emotion into one. What's great about We Bare Bears is that it will never try and make you laugh, it just does it. The humor flows so smoothly, and it is clean of any bathroom-humor and jokes about bodily secretion. A lot of shows nowadays tend to think passing gas and obnoxiously stupid characters are funny, which is only correct if you're talking about toddlers. This show has none of that; it makes you laugh without it being in-your-face, and it has my utmost respect for that. The show can also be emotional, one episode making me verbally gasp as one character hit another. A particularly sad episode was ""Burrito"" which had a very emotional ending (which will not be spoiled here).Finally, the animation. THEY. DID. EVERYTHING. RIGHT! The humans in this show aren't cookie-cutter designs, even if they are in the background. We see curvy women, people with freckles, foreigners and even women who wear Hijabs! Even the sub-character, Chloe, is Korean. I haven't seen a show this broad in characters in a while (besides Steven Universe, which also hit a home run with this).To sum this review up, watch this show. Only 12 episodes are out so far, but they are great. Arguably the most polished show I've seen on Cartoon Network.",647,0,,0,No reference

Bad guys miss, good guys walk heads up high and never-ending clips in their guns and mow them down. Dialogue exists not to flesh out characters, but to produce one-liners. Yes, I had fun watching this. Solid stuff which provides exactly what it promises. The old school action stars missing this one out (mainly Kurt Russell, Wesley Snipes, Steven Seagal and Van Damme) deserve a kick in the butt for doing so.

Law"",and later on other shows would emerged like ""A Different World"",""Seinfeld"", and so forth. In the fall of 1985 it appeared that Beatrice Arthur(who struck gold with ""Maude"",a series that was on CBS created by Norman Lear,which was a spin-off to ""All In The Family"")made a triumph return to television in a new series called ""The Golden Girls"",which was created by Susan Harris. Harris,was already a pioneer in television history when this show premiered on NBC-TV in 1985,since Harris was also behind the creative force of several classic television shows which included ""Soap"",""Benson"",""It's A Living"",and later on ""Empty Nest"". Susan Harris also brought along her winning team of producers for this series as well which included Paul Junger-Witt and Tony Thomas.""The Golden Girls"",made it's premiere debut on September 14,1985 and from the first episode was a immediate hit. It was from that first episode that the show became a powerhouse winner on the network's monster Saturday night lineup of shows which included the successful African-American comedies of ""227"" and ""Amen"",the spin off to ""The Golden Girls"" titled ""Empty Nest"",and the hard hitting action crime drama of ""Hunter"",rounded out to evening programming during NBC's successful comedy-drama lineup during part of the mid-1980's and way into the early 1990's. ""The Golden Girls"" series ran for seven seasons on NBC-TV from September 14,1985 to the final episode of the series on September 7, 1992. The series produced an astounding 180 episodes and won 65 Emmy nominations,11 Emmy Awards,4 Golden Globe Awards,and 2 Viewers for Quality Television Awards. All the lead actresses won Emmys for their performances on the show. ""The Golden Girls"" along with ""All In The Family"",not to mention ""Cheers"",""Frasier"",""Will and Grace"",and to an further extent classic shows like ""M*A*S*H"",""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"",and ""The Andy Griffith Show""(The Don Knotts Episodes) is in a category where all the principal actors have won more Emmy awards in the history of television and ""The Golden Girls"" is right up there in the league of winners.The characters are elderly women all obviously over 50 years of age and lived in an upscale apartment in suburban Miami,Florida. Dorothy(Beatrice Arthur),a smart mouth divorce widow from Brooklyn along with her old-world Sicilian mother Sophia(Estelle Getty),a bubble-headed Minnesota native Rose(Betty White)and a sex-crazed belle from Georgia Blanche(Rue McClanahan). This characters were the best quartet of actresses ever assembled in the history of television and for seven seasons on NBC,""The Golden Girls"" dominated the ratings with vigor,spunk along with some outrageous hilarious hijinks which made it a monster hit on Saturday nights. The series may have been hilarious but it did push the envelope on some of the things that dominated the headlines during its run including some topics that at the time were strictly taboo from TV,but the show handled it with sheer brilliance while providing the laughs. Its no wonder that some of the episodes were extremely funny---just look at the show sometimes and you'll be amazed. And the guest stars that this show had: The guest rosters reads like a who's who here from guest stars like Burt Reynolds, George Clooney, Harold Gould, Phil Leeds, Don Rickles, Mickey Rooney, to Leslie Nielsen, Don Ameche, and Dick Van Dyke.

That being said, I was able to sneak my way in through the swarms of people that did meet the qualifications and I will tell you my thoughts.Predictability. There was no question what was going to happen throughout the film. From the beginning where the little girl was chosen to the girl shooting the apple out of the pig's mouth to the 2 people winning the games. I assume that they figured 90% of the people read the book and already know what is going to happen so there is no need to hide anything or create any element of surprise...Beauty. I am told that the girl is described as being ridiculously beautiful. I'm sorry Jennifer, you're attractive, but I would highly doubt you were in anyone's top 10 before this movie came out. I also just noticed she is supposed to be 16... I don't think so sweetheart.Believability/Technology. So you are telling me that they have thousands of rich people in this giant city that splurge on everything, yet there are a few hundred people in each district that live in poverty. That is a stretch, but still believable, until they show you that they have the technology to create beasts out of thin air that can destroy anything in sight. Yet they still require these outlying districts do farm and get food. You can't automate a farm? Really? You can launch fireballs through the sky by swiping on some giant computer, but you can't grow food without oppressed slave-type people? They broadcast in the sky! Automate a farm, that's all I'm saying...Twilight Effect. Twilight had the vampire and the werewolf, and that was so popular that it actually created sects of fans that were either one or the other, so let's steal that idea because young teens are all about it. So they keep going between the guy she liked from back home and the guy that she was stuck with in the game. We've seen it before, but it will probably work, again and again, because teens and preteens are all about boyfriends and girlfriends and love and... Comic characters. Luckily they didn't go that far, it's not like they created suits that not only protect them from fire but also can create it by either spinning or being in a cart.Thinking.

When the guy from district 11 let Katniss (Hate that name by the way, makes me think Cat *iss) escape because of her friendship with the little girl from district 11, how did he know anything about their relationship? I understand he overheard the girl say she killed the little girl and maybe that the two of them had some sort of friendship, but to let her go, I feel he had to have known a lot more for him to realistically do that.Pace. I felt the movie was very drawn out, yet anytime something important was happening it was rushed.Woody. I actually thought he was a good actor. I didn't like that fact that he was a total drunk and wouldn't listen to them, then one scene later he was sober and doing everything he could to help. His transition felt rushed.The Ending. Where the hell did those dogs come from? That felt very rushed. I would have liked a little more background. Maybe someone mentioning it earlier like ""Watch out at the end, after x amount of time they release the beast things"" Then the whole berry thing was a little lame.

That's what it took? 74 years of sending 2 people down to get killed, knowing they will die, then when she is on a mission that she is lighting fires and using herself as bait she dies, and that is what it took for the district to fight back? They knew she was dead as soon as she left, just like the other 146 people before her. You figure this would have happened before that, 12 districts, 2 people, 74 years, so you are saying all these people sat through 1776 people dying over generations, but this is what caused an uprising? Costumes. I actually liked the costumes. It showed a good contrast between the rich and the poor. Very eye-catching and showed that they were all rich. I also liked the shape of the beard; it was very unique and helped the believability by showing that this wasn't earth or at least the earth that we know, so it makes sense that there are a lot of things that are different. Wait a second... I just read the IMDb and noticed that this is supposed to be North America in the not-so-distant future... I'm sorry but there is no way this is the not so distant future.All in all. I think it was way over-hyped, but I never saw twilight and that made a ton of money and I am told was even more hyped and even worse. At least the acting in this, for the most part, was tolerable. They didn't have as much overacting as Twilight did (at least from the previews that I saw). I don't regret watching it, but I won't be standing in line to watch it again. At least they didn't make it 3D; I don't think I would have been able to stomach an $18 ticket.",973,1,,0,No reference

While it may not be fair to compare both the series, the second installment of Fantastic Beasts crammed too much of Harry Potter in it, that it forgot about its own characters and story.Pros
The score was fantastic, the casting was perfect and it bought back a lot of memories. The action was amazing (opening sequence was one of the best I have ever seen). The visuals were gorgeous and mesmerising. The characters are lovely and honestly, the characters are the reason I watched this film.Cons :The entirety of the movie was sloppy and many scenes were badly executed. Some of the best characters in the first movie are not the centre of attention and are barely there in the movie. Sometimes, it felt like watching a play where there were more plots and more reveals and the movie wanted to run badly on the 'shock factor'. The chemistry between the characters was off , unlike the first film.Final review : A wonderful movie which may have taken itself too far.

What want to do is comment on some of the inaccuracies and bias in the film. 1 Firstly as someone else pointed out Martin was never shot in Canada2 In one part of the film KIngsely says that the IRA are terrorists and Martin replies that he is discriminated against by the British who act like terrorists. This is never challenged and its never mentioned that the security forces contain Northern Irish people too. The film acts almost as if protestants are not legitimate citizens on Northern Ireland. It seems to want to reduce the conflict to the facile level of a British army occupying Ireland which is what ignorant Americans always claimed. So in this way it panders to ignorance.3 For the information of the film makers people in 1980's Northern Ireland referred to parking lots as car parks, called hoods, yobs or hoodlums, and did not used the sentence construction 'get to' as in 'I get to have a new car...'. The attempt to Americanise the English language (presumably so that ignorant people can understand it better) detracts from its realism.4 At the beginning of the film Martin runs from a police/ Army checkpoint and is chased until he is caught. I can assure the film makers that in Northern Ireland at that time anyone running from a checkpoint would have been shot. Ohh but then we would have had no film, so that can't be allowed to happen can it?",257,1,,1,Reference to other reviews
1840,3024028,2016-02-08,MartinHafer,Horrors of the Black Museum (1959),6.0,"""Horrors of the Black Museum"" is a reasonably enjoyable film, though some other films with similar styles of wild murders are certainly a lot more enjoyable such as ""Theatre of Blood"" and the Dr. Phibes films. There are also a few times where the script could have used a bit of a polish.Michael Gough plays a nasty writer who is creating a museum of crime. The police think he's creepy but also respect his practically encyclopedic knowledge of murders. What they don't realize is that his books and museum are so accurate because he commits crimes...or at least, by proxy. It turns out that he's hypnotized his assistant into becoming a murderer and he does all the crimes for him---presumably because Gough's character has extreme difficulty walking.As for the murders, they're very grisly for 1959 and often very creative. Seeing one person with spikes shooting into their eyes another decapitated and another killed with ice tongs to the throat certainly is memorable!! But in the case of the ice tongs, it's actually VERY stupid and a bad cliché. This is because someone realizes who the killer is and instead of going to the cops, she tries to blackmail him!!! And, there is no one around to stop him from killing her...DUH!!! The ending also seemed a tad disappointing. Still, the craziness of the killing and the typically angry performance by Gough make this worth seeing even if it isn't exactly art and even if you learn almost immediately after the beginning of the film who the guy is who is behind the killings!!",263,0,,0,No reference

1842,5327699,2020-10-19,meydiana-65242,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001),10.0,"There's nothing like the first
There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life.

This is an original film that examines the political strife in post-Cold War Eastern Europe the difficulties faced by immigrants in modern America.  But it doesn't stop there: Lana's Rain also looks at the Eastern European criminal underworld, and its affects on refugees in America.  It also takes an unflinching look at the horrors of prostitution, through the eyes of original characters in this fascinating genre piece.The story is told through a familiar genre: the action/crime picture, but this isn't some Tarantino knock-off or film noir wannabe. Michael Ojeda's debut takes a real daring step by having Eastern European actors speaking in Croatian for much of the film!  In an age where too much dialog is dumbed-down by Hollywood and when foreign films are poorly dubbed by producers, it's refreshing to see an American director using language the way it was meant to be.  Ojeda keeps the action flowing neatly, while getting us into the lives of these characters.  We end up caring a lot about these people.As for the cast of unknowns: they are uniformly excellent.  I heard that `Lana' Oksana Orlenko, won the best actress award at the Milan Film Festival.  No surprises there! She's immensely talented, radiating pathos and a raw sensuality from the screen.

I first saw it when it  as the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and loved it ever since. I ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters, and if it was playing today I'd go out to see it again.
Now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads. Matthau was brilliant, but had the misfortune of being nominated against Jack Nicholson's Oscar winning performance of Randall P. MacMurphy in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest. Burns did win, though Richard Benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well. Even the smallest roles were played to perfection, like Fritz Feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial. Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film, the direction of the greatly underrated Herbert Ross. Ross who previously brought a two person play, ""The Owl And The Pussycat"" to the screen and made a full movie out of it, does it again. He opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play. He fleashens out the story and the characters.
Here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special. Though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is totally new. A few years ago I did see at the broadway revival of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful. But I think that Ross and screenwriter, playwright Simon improved on it.

1848,1975291,2010-06-07,dierregi,Sex and the City 2 (2010),4.0,"This movie got dreadful reviews, so I was curious to judge for myself. I am assuming that nobody would go and watch ""Sex & the City"" expecting any serious sort of entertainment. Consequently, I was surprised to read the poisonous review of film critics who suddenly realized that Carrie & co. are selfish, spoiled and hedonistically interested only in themselves. This should come as no surprised to anybody familiar with SATC. Anyway, back to the movie: it offers a couple of hours of entertainment without any pretense of being taken seriously. That is, apart from the product placement – I am sure somebody is expecting you to invest big cash in shoes and handbags. However, if you are not easily lured into spending big bucks, it is a relatively safe experience. For me, it was like one of those fantasy movies of the 30's, with Carole Lombard as a millionaire heiress and William Powell as her butler. It is an escapist fantasy for people living during hard times and Willing to spend a couple of hours without worrying about the future – just like during the Depression. Hundreds of such escapist movies were churned out during the Depression and nowadays they are considered classic.I do not want to imply that SATC2 is in any way a classic, but neither is the horrendous movie described by critics. My guess is they were so negative because they would like to live like Carrie & co., but cannot afford it. In fact, not many of us can, but some of us can at least be so sincere as to admit that living like them looks more fun than being a missionary in a rundown village without electricity or running water. Sainthood is not for everyoneI also understand the choice of Middle East as an area relatively untouched by the world economic crisis and as a good location for a luxury fantasy. Having written this I must add that indeed the product placement, the fashion and the greed of the ladies are OTT and feel a bit nauseating. I will not even tackle the subject of disrespect and the Muslim traditions, because it truly does not make any sense in this context.Conclusion: Many critics love violent, dark movies such as the Batman franchise and other action movies. Apparently there is never too much blood, too many car chase scenes or too many bullets flying around.

As two ace but out-of-work middle-aged salesmen who video-conference their way to a coveted summer internship at Google, the two A-list comedians are the very reasons why the loosely-scripted and perhaps entirely formulaic underdog tale still proves enjoyable.As with 'Crashers', this Shawn Levy-directed film coasts along by the sheer easy interplay between the actors – Vaughn with his glib-but desperate patter and Wilson with his earnest sweetness. Indeed, Vaughn's screenplay – which he co-wrote with Jared Stern based upon his own story - specifically plays in both dialogue and character to the natural rapport and personality of the two stars, so much so that even their banter over some triviality – like the merits of including Alanis Morissette's 'Ironic' on their 'Get Psyched' mix – is so effortlessly engaging.Thanks to their camaraderie, what is otherwise a two-hour commercial for GoogleWorld comes off much less ingratiating. To be fair, 'the world's number one company' can't quite be held responsible for this longest example of product placement; it was Vaughn after all who pitched this movie to the company, which then saw no reason not to reject his offer of free publicity. Nonetheless, the 'Google is great' subtext is too blatant to be ignored –whether in terms of endless free food or access to 'nap-pods' - and your tolerance for 'Googliness' will still affect how much you enjoy this buddy comedy.Acknowledging the digital divide that exists between the tech-savvy and the tech-goondos in today's world, Vaughn and Wilson start off as mid- 40-somethings that are hopelessly old-school analog idiots. As such narrative trajectories demand, they are ostracised among the other interns who are mostly half their age. But teamed with a bunch of misfit geek kids in a Hunger Games-like competition where the winners gets the chance at full-time jobs, the seemingly clueless Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Vaughn) get their chance to demonstrate that it isn't all about tech-speak and tech-knowhow; rather, some old-fashioned teamwork and salesmanship might just make all the difference.These are interesting observations about the new corporate America, but earnest as the film may be about imparting such wisdom, its approach is as corny as can be, complete with a cringe-inducing climax that sees the band of outcasts triumph the arrogant smarty-pants led by an appropriately cocky Max Minghella. Instead, the film truly comes alive when it simply lets Vaughn and Wilson do what they do best – and that is, play street smart and party-hearty. Easily the film's funniest sequence has Nick and Billy showing their troupe how to have a wild night out at a strip club, unleashing the inner animal in a clammy high- IQ Asian boy Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael) with low social skills, a glum cynic Stuart (Dylan O'Brien) whose head is constantly buried in his smartphone, a sexually curious South Asian Neha (Tiya Sircar) and even their socially awkward 23-year-old Google team leader Lyle (Josh Brener).Outside the club though, Vaughn and Wilson get recurrent amusing gags haggling the intimidating head of their intern programme Mr Chetty (Aasif Mandvi) and a Google staffer Dana (Rose Bryne) respectively. They also gently riff on 'X-Men' and 'Flashdance', though the use of the latter does wear out its welcome especially to those who have no inkling of that 80s cultural benchmark. Still, the better moments belong to the ones where Vaughn and Wilson are simply allowed to hang loose and be funny, a last-ditch effort to inject some dramatic tension with Vaughn's departure from the team prior to their crucial last task resolved in a deus-ex-machina that rings hollow.Like we said earlier, this is a film that runs entirely on the exceedingly affable, good-natured charm of its two leads. To his credit, Levy does a fair job keeping the film light-hearted yet pacey, while giving Vaughn and Wilson the space to exercise their considerable improvisational comedy gifts. Put aside the Google-oogling, and what you have is an opportunity to simply chill with two funny old pals, who Crash-ed their way out of a Wedding eight years earlier and are back for a reunion that feels every bit as delightful.",722,0,,0,No reference

1864,747032,2004-03-23,F Gwynplaine MacIntyre,Strangler's Morgue (1946),1.0,"Beginning in the first year of Queen Victoria's reign, there were rumours in England of a bizarre criminal nicknamed Springheel Jack, who was allegedly able to leap to superhuman distances and heights. The legend lasted into Edward VII's time, with the result that a few minor but genuine criminals began calling themselves Springheel Jack. (A minor character in Michael Crichton's novel 'The Great Train Robbery' uses this name.) Several Victorian stage melodramas featured Springheel Jack as a character. This film is based on one such play ... although it takes place in 1805, which is too early for Jack's exploits.

Handsome Jack Wraydon is a captain in an army regiment quartered in Essex, prepared to defend England against an invasion by the troops of Napoleon. (No mention is made of the French army's disastrous attempt to invade Fishguard, Wales, in 1798.) Captain Wraydon is nicknamed Springheel Jack, for his prodigious ability to high-jump ... which we keep hearing about in the dialogue, but which we never see onscreen. Jack Wraydon is afraid to marry, due to 'the curse of the Wraydons'. Supposedly, his family has a history of hereditary insanity, but the only documented example of this is his deceased uncle Philip, who was a mad inventor.

Meanwhile, some blaggard known only as 'The Chief' (Tod Slaughter, as hissable as always) is preying upon the king's soldiers, strangling them with laughable ease. The Chief has two henchmen who speak with the most blatantly phony Cockney accents I've ever heard ... even worse than Dick van Dyke in 'Mary Poppins'. SPOILERS COMING. It turns out that the Chief is actually Philip Wraydon, alive after all. Philip has apparently invented some sort of infernal machine which amplifies the 'power' of the human body, enabling him to make prodigious leaps which enable him to frame his nephew Jack for Philip's crimes. Regrettably, we never actually see Tod Slaughter doing his Springheel Jack routine: a pity, as it would have been hilarious to see this fat little man kangarooing his way across the screen.

All of Tod Slaughter's films are very creaky, with only 'Sweeney Todd' and 'The Face at the Window' enjoyable for modern audiences. 'The Curse of the Wraydon' is very likely his worst. This material is beyond stagebound. At the alleged 'climax' of the film, two characters stand in a room and have a long slow conversation in which they agree that they ought to hurry to the old mill. When they finish this conversation, one of them says 'Hurry!', which is the cue for both of them to saunter towards the mill. As they approach the mill, they hear a scream. This prompts them to stop in their tracks and have another long conversation, in which they agree that they ought to investigate the scream. Having settled this, they stroll purposefully forward.

In this entire film, there's one and only one clever cinematic device. After Philip Wraydon frames Jack for his own crimes, a reward is posted for Jack Wraydon's capture. The reward is 100 guineas. (In real life, the reward would have been in pounds ... even though spade guineas were still in circulation in 1805.) We see the reward poster in close-up, while -- through a series of dissolves -- the reward gradually increases. This effect is spoilt somewhat by the fact that the reward handbill is printed in what is obviously 20th-century typography.

At the end of the film, Philip chucks his nephew Jack into one of those dungeon pits with walls that gradually move together, crushing anyone between them. All this time, we've been hearing about Jack's ability to leap to superhuman heights ... so now we expect finally to see that ability onscreen, even if it requires trick photography. Curses! Foiled again! Jack escapes from the pit by another method entirely ... and of course Tod Slaughter falls into the pit, just in time to get crushed by his own infernal machine.

'The Curse of the Wraydons' is so bang awful, I'm tempted to rate it zero points. But due to my interest in the actual Springheel Jack mystery -- which I mentioned in my novel 'The Woman Between the Worlds' -- I'll rate this movie one point out of 10.

Graphic depictions of reproduction by gigantic, ancient, supernatural, monster, insects. Even that's boring. They can't carry this film. In part because their supposed capacity to be a parasite to Godzilla is oddly bypassed..... That's gotta be the real story angle with this set up surely!? But no. No. It isn't. Possibly designing them to resemble the beast from 20000 fathoms would have injected some non-boringness into them by being a kudus gaining reference for monster movie fans?! But no. No. They didn't.As many people have said this film is structured as a slow burn story, mainly availing the audience of snippets of Godzilla until he is unleashed in the climactic engagement with the Muto's. Snippets eventually have skirmishes added to them until the big kaboom fight.It's nice to know that the monsters in this film have read their fair share of film scripts. So that they know how to behave. Entirely the opposite of the monsters in the director Edwards' breakout film.By contrast the madness and of the Japanese Godzilla is gone. Why make Godzilla films if they're not mad? It's the main crazy enjoyment that I get from them! Sometimes watching Japanese Godzilla films I'm not sure if I have any sense of any sense at all and that's utterly absent in this film. The film makes rigid sense.Also Godzilla himself is surely a direct agent acting on humanity within Japanese film traditions: either as our enemy/destroyer/agent of judgement or as our odd/mad protector. From space alien giant robots and other denizens of ""Monster Island"" and such like.Here Godzilla seems remote to humanity as a whole. Apart that is, from one American family possessed of truly prodigious ""right place right time"" capacity. It's good to see that they read film scripts too!As another attempt to make an American version of a Godzilla film this is to my mind a failure.For me the actual artistic design of Godzilla has some good in it and his smashing sky scrapers with impacts from his prone body is actually quite cool in it's solid way. The skydiving military sequence is a proper piece of blockbuster filmmaking in my opinion.Therefore personally I rate this film 3/10; a notch above barely dismal level because one or two sequences of good visuals, one scene outstanding, are included.",395,1,,1,Reference to other reviews
1870,2312954,2012-07-03,tieman64,Urban Cowboy (1980),,"James Bridges directs ""Urban Cowboy"", an attempt to cash in on John Badham's ""Saturday Night Fever"". Both films star John Travolta, though here he trades bell-bottoms, disco balls and dance floors for cowboy hats, mechanical bulls, pickup trucks and square dancing.For some reason, 1980s Hollywood saw a boom in films which romanticised blue-collar work. Here Travolta and his gang spend their days working hard with hardhats at oil refineries, before spending their well-earned nights dancing at local clubs or riding mechanical bulls. Travolta's love interest in the film is Sissy, played by Debra Winger, who ""wants to be independent"", much to the chagrin of Travolta who ""doesn't think gals should behave that way"". Sissy thus defiantly ""rides a mechanical bull"" in a ""sexy manner"" which ""attracts men"" and ""makes Travolta angry"". The couple then fight, break up and get back together. Much of the film consists of men spouting macho wisdom (""a man don't back down when things get tough""), proving their masculinity by riding mechanical bulls, dancing like cowboys or beating up women. Like many of the ""urban cowboy flicks"" of this era (see Eastwood's ""Bronco Billy""), our cowboy hero thus spends most of his time, not beating Indians, but battering and attempting to tame uppity women. Interestingly, Travolta's a ""cowboy"" only when at his town's Western-themed dance halls and bars. Outside these establishments he's just a regular, blue collar worker. His masculinity is thus solely defined by what happens on the dance floor. When Sissy (her name a slur) encroaches on this, Travolta gets hilariously mad. Very literally, the film is about cowboys who, having lost their mythical Wild West to big oil companies, mega-corporations and stifling 9 to 5 routines, sublimate their resentment by battering and besting each other on mechanical bulls. When women start riding the bulls, the already fragile egos of these guys goes berserk.While there's ample material here for a look at working class frustrations and the dying of subcultures, the film misses the point of its own story and completely ignores the causes of all its flying fists...namely those big factories and the logic of the almighty dollar. For this whole 1980s, romanticized blue-collar movement done better in under 4 minutes, listen to Lennon's ""Working Class Hero"" a couple times.5/10 – Good ambiance and decor undermined by dumb plot.

1875,165666,2000-04-27,curtis-8,Three Amigos! (1986),,"""Three Amigos"" has always struck me as a movie filled with more missed opportunities than actual laughs. It's not a bad movie by any means; the concept is clever and in fact many individual segments are brilliant.But far too often the director, John Landis, seems to have been relying on his three leads (Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short) to simply ""be funny"" without the aid of a funny script. This approach can work if you happen to film 10 times as many improvs as you need so you can then pick out the truly funny ones (see ""Austin Powers""). There are so many long, drawn out scenes where the Three Amigos simply seem to be mugging aimlessly while they wait for Landis to yell ""Cut!""BUT--and this is a big but--Steve Martin's screenplay does have several hilariously weird bits and Landis does stage some wonderful musical numbers to Randy Newman's songs. All in all, ""Three Amigos"" is much better than Landis' other half-assed Saturday Night Live type flick ""Spies Like Us"". In fact, ""Three Amigos"" is better than almost anything Landis has don for the past decade and a half (unfortunately, most of his recent movies have sucked big time, so the praise is admittedly faint).",207,0,,0,No reference

Why does he seem to be immortal? Is he Jesus? Will he be able to deliver the messages in the afterlife? To tell Evie she's loved? To find out where Grace's kids' shoes are? To get the song from Christopher Sunday? Will he see Laurie there? Well, sure, those are all good questions-- but instead, let's watch Patty moderate a sit-down between two 'aspects' of Kevin, to try to figure out *why* he keeps running from the women who love him. Oh, and he has to use his dick- now practically a character unto itself- to open a door, nothing to interpret there. {thump.} (Yes, it *thumps* when he sets it on something.) Genius.And how answers were encoded in Patty's dialog with Kevin after he 'summoned' her? Telling him that she was there because he chose her; that he could have turned back at any time, but he persisted despite ""knowing what was inside him;"" that killing everybody on the anniversary was just 'giving them what they wanted,' because they expected something to happen? One hour of TV, endless hours of analysis! Which, in the end, is all some of us want from our fiction, and why we'll miss this show so much after next week.There was some gripping drama, yes, and some heartbreak (literally)- it wouldn't be The Leftovers without that- but this episode was also wickedly funny in its absurdity. Which may be exactly what we need between a deeply-moving-but-sad ""Certified"" and what may end up being a *really* heavy ""Book of Nora."" So in the end, it doesn't feel wasted, despite setting aside, or alternately just taking for granted the supernatural questions (okay, I get it, season 2 theme song, ""let the mystery be""), because it brought everything back 'home' to the character who's at the center of the story, and dug into his heart to try and understand, at long last, what drives him.As to what next week will bring, the last moments of ""The Book of Kevin"" suggested that he and Nora won't be reuniting next week, but there might still be hope: if this week ended with Kevin ""nuking the afterlife,"" clearing out the souls held there and preventing him from ever returning, then just maybe he and Nora can reconcile and spend the rest of their lives together (naïve, maybe, but one can hope), but not 'eternity' afterwards... Six more days until we find out.Unless we don't.",465,0,,0,No reference
1887,3373948,2017-08-26,net_orders,Shinshaku Yotsuya kaidan: kôhen (1949),5.0,"YOTSUYA KAIDAN, PART II (SHINSHAKU YOTSUYA KAIDAN: KOUHEN). Viewed on Streaming. Score = six (6) stars; cinematography = six (6) stars; lighting = two (2) stars; restoration = one (1) star. Director Keisuke Kinoshita wraps up his stretched-out tale involving a wimpy, unemployed samurai who murders wife #1 in order to marry a rich wife # 2, and is immediately and endless remorseful to the point of imaging the seeing of wife # 1 all over the place. The Director cleverly factors in a number of strange events and starts to build ghostly suspense in the first half of the story. Unfortunately, this momentum evaporates with the subsequent endless, tedious, over-the-top emoting of lead actor Shigeru Amachi in the role of the wife-murdering (and wimpy) samurai as well as subplots involving multiple levels of blackmail. A house fire (see below) finally puts the hammy samurai character out of the viewer's misery. Actor Osamu Takizawa delivers the best performance by far as a self-declared, one-man Yakuza! The film provides an incredulous ""Hollywood Happy Ending"" with an after-life shot of the samurai and wife # 1 strolling among (what else?) cherry blossoms! The production seems overly ""stage-bound,"" as action is mostly limited to running and jumping around a small interior set especially during a spectacularly-photographed fire at the film's conclusion (see below). Further, lead actresses and actors seemed to have learned their trade on the live stage given their stilted mannerisms (or perhaps this is just due to poor direction?). Cinematography (narrow screen, black and white) is very good. There are several fine tracking shots and the fire scenes at the end of the movie make it appear as if actresses and actors are right on the middle of a burning set! Lighting is mostly poor with many scenes just too dark to determine what is happening. Score is fine. Subtitles are close enough. Restoration is among the missing. This is a 70-year old film, and, sadly, it sure looks and sounds like it! Not especially recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",338,0,,0,No reference
1888,3288862,2017-05-01,fionaleahkelly,The Ghastly Love of Johnny X (2012),9.0,"In 2012, The Ghastly Love of Johnny X grossed $117 during its one week theatrical run, making it the lowest grossing movie of that year. Nearly five years later it played in a one-room theater in a suburb of Akron, Ohio where I saw it for the first time.At the time, I didn't know anything about the film other than what I got from the trailer. It played the week before in the same theater preceding a showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I thought that the trailer looked cool, and I recognized Creed Bratton (who plays Creed Bratton in The Office), so I decided to see the film the following week.The film is a black and white sci-fi musical. It sounds bizarre, but it works in a weird way. It's a love letter to old sci-fi films, and it uses a 50's aesthetic to give it some flavor.The biggest thing that stuck with me from the film is that it's truly art. I don't think many people can actually pull off black and white (whether that be in photography or film), but Paul Bunnell (director, writer, and producer) clearly thought about his visuals throughout the film. The film has an extremely strong grasp on light and dark contrasts. This leads to many pretty images throughout the film, and it makes the scenery visually interesting. While the diner or club or desert may have been muted in color, Bunnell brings out the beauty of these places by contrasting the lightness of the background with darkness in the foreground.Even beyond the visual aspects of the film, everything is tightly constructed and considered. The film manages to be an homage to the genre without ever veering too far into camp or employing a dues ex machina to help the characters escape from a situation. The rules of this quirky and compelling universe are all laid out clearly at the beginning of the film.Throughout Johnny X, the characters manage to draw the line between camp and genuine emotion. The characters are playing genre tropes, to be sure, but they are also fleshed out. Each character has motivations but also wants and dreams. The genuine nature of the characters plays a big role in selling this film.If anything, movie-lovers should seek this film out because of its place in cinematic history. This is the final film appearance of Kevin McCarthy, star of Invasion of the Body-Snatchers. It is also the last film to be made with Kodac Eastman Plus-X Negative Film 5231 (the film is now discontinued), which gives the movie its signature look.Overall, however, The Ghastly Love of Johnny X's title as lowest-grossing film of 2012 is not a reflection on its quality. Fans of classic sci-fi or cult movies should definitely add this film to their list.",466,0,,0,No reference

It all becomes a little more intricate than that when the lives of the forensic investigators searching for this ""Devil"" get intertwined with the case.We are from the generation which adores movies like ""Se7en"", ""Zodiac"" or shows like ""Mindhunters"". A thriller where you have to catch the murderer before he makes someone else his target is really something which keeps us on the edge of our seats. Asur is certainly that but a bit more as well. It creates an exceptional cocktail of modern forensic science and mystic Indian mythology. So basically, it gives the audience a taste of future advancements as well as make them wistful by referencing the stories we heard from our parents/grandparents.Every episode has the power to keep you hooked with a highpoint leaving you wanting more. It is undeniably something you can binge in one go. The star cast is well suited in their respective roles. Watching Arshad Warsi in a stern avatar was a delight. He played his part with finesse, so did Barun Sobti, who had to showcase a range of sentiments throughout the series.The only thing that feels like a little drag is that all the ecstasy of watching a unique series could not hide the fact that how easily foreseeable the climax was. Also, there were quite some questions the season left us with which might be answered in the next season, possibly, but they feel more like loopholes that the Asur writers just overlooked and moved on fixating on how to make it more appealing.I love how Indian creators are now producing inimitable series with the dawn of web hosting applications like Prime Video, Netflix and Voot. Some are winning our hearts, like, ""Sacred Games"" and ""Made in Heaven"" but rest all are getting lost in the plethora of content getting dumped on these platforms now and then. The premise of ""Asur"" promises to be different, which it absolutely is, but in turn, it compromises on some truly essential aspects of a good television thriller. I would definitely give it a go if I were you, hoping that season two solves all the ambiguity and answer all the questions we have.",382,0,,0,No reference
1891,5476135,2020-12-14,bensonmum2,Fourteen Hours (1951),7.0,"A normal beat cop, Officer Charles Dunnigan (Paul Douglas), is tasked with talking a would-be jumper off a ledge fifteen floors above the New York streets.Overall, Fourteen Hours is an entertaining film with plenty of drama and tension. There are a couple of things that made the movie stand out to me. First, I was incredibly impressed with the way the film was put together by director Henry Hathaway. Fourteen Hours featured far more action than I expected from a film set on a 2'X4' ledge. All of the comings and goings in the hotel room attached to the ledge and everything going on on the street below help keep things interesting and moving. It's an amazing amount of activity for a little piece of concrete. And I was equally impressed with some of the camera work. There were moments filmed from the ledge looking down to the street below that made me feel as if I were there. My vertigo actually kicked in.Second, the acting is superb. Paul Douglas, in particular, is excellent. He's so believable trying to talk the man off the ledge, all the while conveying the fact that he has no idea what he's doing. And you can see the real care in his voice and face as each new idea is brought forward. Really strong piece of acting. The rest of the cast is just as good, including: Richard Basehart as the confused man on the ledge and Agnes Moorehead as the overwrought mother. I also enjoyed spotting a few uncredited faces in the cast, like Russell Hicks, Harvey Lembeck, and Ossie Davis (especially proud of myself for this one).Fourteen Hours is also known for being Grace Kelly's first film role. She's fine and all, but her storyline could have been cut without harming the film at all. That extra five minutes weren't really necessary. I won't say the same about the subplot featuring Jeffery Hunter and Debra Paget. Their ""cute"" little story made for a nice contrast to the drama on the ledge.7/10",339,0,,0,No reference

The story is about a director who has been working in Hollywood all his life and is pretty useless. He hires an assistant who is actually intelligent and starts making progress for the director. Unfortuntly for the assistant, the house he works in is full of crazies! The director is the out of touch indian who is an amnesiac, blows his top over everything, and is used to paying his assistants $1.25 an hour to degrade them (very swimming with sharks). His wife is this high strunk housewife who freaks out over nothing. His son, judd, is the cream of the crop. He is a psychotic, obsessive-compulsive, wannabe actor. The scene where Judd comes in and does his ""Acting"" performance for the assistant is classic! He constantly lives in fear of the ceiling caving in on him, lives in constant pain from an oversize hemorrhoid, and does tasteless homosexual humor. The director does everything to try to belittle his assistant like talking over him, and in one scene, making him drive 2 hours away to deliver a script 10 minutes before the assistant is supposed to be off work, all the while not paying him gas, mileage, or overtime. When the assistant complains the director says ""thats showbiz""! Another classic scene is when the director tries to cut $25 off the assistant pay because the assistant left the computer on the night before (because the idiot director had him type a 3 page letter one minute before the assistant had to leave and get to his afternoon job). All this after the director going 1 year owing his assistant $1800!

The trouble is there are just so many missed opportunities for humor. Not much of a laugh-out-loud in the entire thing. Absurdity is the name of the game, and the absurdity isn't all that funny. Nice try, I'll give it 5 stars for effort, but frankly the script needed a lot more polish by funnier writers. I'd like to see this idea re-done with more wit. Don't give up guys; try it again.

1894,582823,2003-04-09,unclealan,The MatchMaker (1997),7.0,"I've seen this movie perhaps six times or more over the past few years, have lived in Massachusetts for awhile, and have traveled around Ireland -- so I feel fully qualified to comment on the content of this film.First, it has a totally believable premise: an idiot Senator from Massachusetts (no surprise here), based on advice from a slimeball consultant (deftly played by Dennis Leary) sends a lackey (Janeane Garofalo) on a mission to Ireland to document his family roots, so that he can use this information to pander to his Irish constituents during a close re-election campaign.The lackey (named Marcy) arrives in a small village during the middle of a match-making festival, tries in vain to research the Senator's family history, ends up questioning her own morality and hypocrisy, and eventually falls for a local bar-keeping Irishman (Sean, played by David O'Hara).  Love triumphs in the end back at Quincy Market in Boston.  How sweet.
The MatchMaker was beautifully filmed, has an excellent soundtrack, and the Irish characters, who are the true stars of the film, play their parts well. Many of the actors in the delightful movie ""Waking Ned Devine"" appear here as well.  Overall it's a pleasant comedy.  Especially fun to watch is matchmaker Milo O'Shea, and the banter he shares with a competitor (Rosaleen Linehan).  The scene where the local townsfolk rebel against the Senator in a ""staged"" family reunion is also a laugh-aloud hoot.However, the film is not without its problems. It's chock full of Irish stereotypes (numerous references to JFK, and lots of drinking, singing, and dancing in the pubs).  The characters all seem to be overtly friendly to Marcy.  Yes, the Irish are indeed friendly folk, but this movie goes way over the top at times.  Marcy's in town for but a few days, yet the townspeople speak and interact with her as if they've known her for years, even after they discover her true motive for being there. Pleeeease.The biggest problem I have with the movie is Garofalo herself.  She's just not cut out to play a romantic part.  She's a drinking buddy, not a lover. Her scenes with David O'Hara are awkward at best.  Sure, she's mildly attractive (at least she was in 1997), but she's also gruff and gritty. These are Garofalo's supposed comedic traits, but, like her political opinions, they wear on you after awhile, and it becomes clearly and quickly apparent that she was miscast here.One final dig against Janeane.  I try to separate one's politics from the performance, but, like her character in this movie, Garofalo is a hypocrite. She's often labeled those in the current administration as ""stupid,"" even though she's just a ""hip"" college dropout who has little qualification (other than being famous), to question their intelligence.  The accuracy of Garofalo's views is best illustrated in the following exchange in the film between her and O'Hara...Marcy: Is being ""stupid"" like being high all the time?Sean:  No, it's like being right all the time.Well said Sean, well said.",502,0,,0,No reference

If you are going to make a movie from an original masterpiece you should attempt to be as true as possible to the original work, however, it is clear that the script writers had little imagination on how to dramatize and remain true to the original work.

Only then does a complicated relationship start between them, which is likely to be heading towards a love story. Unlike many such stories from other films, but maybe as it happens not only on many occasions in life, love is not a pre-condition of the intimate relationship, but the other way.The relationship between Alain and Marion has every chance to lead to nothing. There is about 20 years of age difference between them, and both go through deep and different crises. Alain Moreau is a singer who crossed the 50 years threshold and is beyond the peak of his career and vocal abilities. He sings in dance clubs and at various social events, interprets covers and knows how to dialogue with an audience made up of mostly aged women. He is passionate about what he does, but his profession and his career are threatened by the karaoke trend and the sunset of the dance halls that were once so popular. Marion works at a real estate agency, she is a beautiful woman and an efficient professional, whose private life is marked by a first marriage that seems to have ended very badly for her, leading to the alienation of her son about ten years old. Alain and Marion meet again, they are attracted to each other, but the relationship is hesitant, it needs pretexts, is full of silences and separations. It is precisely this uncertainty that makes the relationship between the two credible. True love stories are rarely linear and straight forward.The quality of the film owes much to the two lead actors. Gérard Depardieu is huge in this film and he amazes me again with the combination of unique and personal charisma and the way he manages to melt into the role. He plays and sings with passion, loves and asks himself permanently, and at no point do we doubt that he is both Alain Moreau and Gérard Depardieu. Cécile de France is beautiful and vulnerable. Many of the scenes between them are composed of few words, of silence and glances, and yet the chemistry between the two is evident. They seem to be constantly wondering what is happening to them and why love appeared in their path in such an improbable embodiment. Their meetings often take place in mansions or villas for sale, impersonal or personalized by and for others, alien to their experiences in a way that reminded me of Michelangelo Antonioni's films. The atmosphere of the dance clubs and the industry of music for consumption is excellently rendered, and I want to point out here also the supporting acting performances of Mathieu Amalric and Christine Citti. The film is sensitive and credible, and has many chances to remain in the viewers' memory long after watching it.",500,0,,0,No reference

This a very political movie, trying to justify why America waged a war over more than one country because of the alleged action of very small group of extremest residing in these countries.No surprise that the movie had little success on the foreign market. This movie is offensive and is depicting only what is favorable for the Americans in an exaggerating way and missing the reality of the war.

Plus he pointed out that crazy megaphone!!)Someone else generic says ""This turned out to be one helluva vacation"", someone else says ""Its not fair this should happen to me"" and a character responds to the querie ""What about Christine?"" with the answer ""She didn't make it.""The attacks mainly consist of heightened music, the camera guy bobbing the camera up and down to make the ants look as though they are moving.  Throw some water dyed red on their face, and you're less one more cast member.There was an intentionally funny moment that deserves mention.  Two of the survivors are on the street and hear a sound like the ants are approaching, but its just a kid riding a Big Wheels.  The end must be seen to be believed, but it consists of a sugar factory, a queen ant with gas, zombie townies and the best line in the movie..""They are superior""H.G. Wells is spinning in his grave.  I love this movie but obviously do not have a ton of respect for it.  Regardless of anything else, I think we should all raise a glass to Warren Estes, who is listed in the end credits as 'Ant Co-Ordinator'..who else ever held that job on a set?

It's something of a shame that this movie may be best remembered for the incident on Katie Hepburn's last day of filming. Appalled at the way Mank had treated a damaged and vulnerable Monty Clift throughout the shoot Hepburn ascertained from Mank that there was no way she would be required for retakes, dubbing, etc and then spat in his face. Unlike some of the posters here I still found things to admire in Clift's performance even though light years from his best; Taylor, of course, has the big scene at the end and makes the most of it but Hepburn is no slouch herself so in terms of emoting it's the viewer who comes off best.",206,1,,1,Reference to other reviews

The power these newspapermen wield when interrogating witnesses, making up stories, and pushing around a milquetoast D.A. is crazy. Maybe if you believe that most news is 'fake news' this film may resonate with you, but otherwise the script is so lacking in every way (intelligence, artistry, charm,....) and it's a slog to sit through even with its short runtime. The main newspaperman (Kenneth Thomson) is annoying, and there's not nearly enough of Joan Blondell.

1913,1635110,2008-05-12,ian-1211,Me Too! (2006– ),4.0,"Well, to being, this programme is from the same folk who did ""Balamory"" (which I never really did like) but was good for children. Now this does have the same good points as Balamory but there are certainly some things that bother about this show. Well, this place is set where Balamory in also in, yes you guess it, Scotland. There are a lot of television show coming from Scotland at the moment (they must have a big industry). I enjoy a great deal of children's shows from Scotland but I love their accents and scenery. The actors are all probably Scottish so that does liven things up a bit. The good parts also include that it teaches children like problem solving, mathematical skills (telling the time) and life at work (although they wouldn't be doing this stuff of their own for at least another 14 years of so) along with good singing skills (if that for any use?). Now down to the negatives, which are as long my right arm. First off, Granny Murray is plain creepy. Sorry to the actress who plays her but she is! I can't stand it the way she says ""Hello, Honey-pieeeee! Come a wee in"" to us the viewers in every episode (like we are going into her house). Very disturbing. Kids might like it because they might feel included but I fell this is a bit too much in your face. Secondary, she is just too happy. Far too happy it non-existent. Nobody can be that happy all the time. And her laughs are like a witch's gaggle. Plus, at the end of every episode she tells us what she did with the children while we were concentrating on the adult and it the same thing over and over and over and over again (Why were splishing, splashing, dunking, sliding etc. etc. etc.) it the same story the whole darn thing. The adults who we then go off with to follow to work but they ask us in each episode to show them the way to get there and sign a song about it. Jeez, if you know the way to work since you been doing same job for a matter of years then why are you asking us for? Why do they run around town chatting to non-living objects like saying ""Hello, Bus! Hello, Carpet! Hello, Computer! Hello, Bike!"" Not only is this moronic but it encourages to take no notice of reality and think it okay to talk to objects (which will certainly not reply back!) Can you imagine your child walking down a street and start saying ""Hello, Lollipop! Hello, Balloon! Hello, Dustbin! Hello, Needle"" (A Syringe covered with drugs). Not only is this unacceptable behaviour coming from adult figures but do why want our kids trying to talks to clocks, automatic doors and trolleys? I don't think so! Why does Granny Murray childmind a dog????? If the owner wants to leave their pet in another person hand then give it your neighbour or something. A dog is an animal, not a child and in cases like these, a dog around small children could be vicious and may attack them in real life. Not a good image at all!!!! Mickey-John shouldn't be a teacher. He is far too immature and the stuff he teaches his class is pure garbage. Things like ""What shape is a sandwich?"" or ""What does a Jolly Rodger flag look like?"" and even his own class have wake him up to teach them? I wouldn't be very happy if he was teaching my child. Why does two musician ladies keep popping up in everything? They are even on the school grounds and also are allowed to perform to kids during their school-time? Would the headteacher have something to say this? Poor Bobby doesn't get much sleep, does she? In the episodes evolving around her, she clean the buses at night and then in the day she is about interacting with the other characters Surely she must sleep, must she? Poor thing. And finally, there doesn't seem to be any here that is completely educational. There are some good points like I mentioned above but other then that it really just about signing and solving simple-minded & non harmful problems like ""A lost toy"" or ""A spill down your jumper"", that kind of stuff. I know it is probably aiming for 2-3 years old but surely they must know how to deal with those problems by now? They'll find it tedious after a while. Overall, this does have some good points and I know it is a child's show but they are some definite signs of frustrating issues around this teaching children how to spend their time or relying on other people to help you (somebody else always try to help the main character solve their problem). Not a good independence lesson. Overall, this show is okay for distracting your young children but if you looking for a more educational and informative programmes, you best go and look somewhere else. 4/10",845,0,,0,No reference

Cannell. The Cannell touch is clearly evident. A duo of would be heroes, Barry Tarberry (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Black Jack Savage (Stoney Jackson) who are assisted by a nerd genius, Logan ""FX"" Murphy (Steve Hytner) strive to get the bad guys. Tarberry is an American financier whose questionable deals have forced him to flee the country one step ahead of the Feds. And once he takes refuge on a Caribbean island by bribing the President, Tarberry also has to dodge the bounty hunters hired by the bail bondsman that Tarberry stiffed of $500,000. Tarberry discovers the castle he purchased is haunted by the ghost of Black Jack Savage. The two form an unlikely partnership for their own reasons. Kelly is perfect as the handsome hero who has a smidgen of the coward to overcome. Jackson is terrific as the hip 300 year old ghost who has to redeem himself by saving a hundred lives or he will be sent to Hell. Since this was the premise for a series, the movie has much exposition to fill in the background and present the raison detre. The made for TV movie is fun and should be put on a DVD along with the six episodes of the series. It's too bad this didn't click but audiences may have passed on this as a retrofit of Riptide with one of the good guys as a ghost.

Maybe because of the recent comic assault from films like American Pie and There's Something About Mary, people might be turned off by the measured deliveries and wry performances. The cast is uniformly fine most notably Jason Lee's unsatisfied billionaire, Alfre Woodard's knowing but lonely eatery owner, and Hope Davis' (will you marry me?!?) troubled but sweet headcase. Another volley of kudos should be mentioned towards Mumford's unifying theme of exceptance without question. Where else in recent cinematic memory have we had the likes of portly Pruitt Taylor Vince and the vivacious Mary McDonnell falling for each other while the Woodard/Lee angle thrives despite differences not only in race but in age too.

Julianne Moore also does a great job in her role as a woman who has turned to the bottle after her own romantic endeavors have failed. If I had one minor quibble about her part, I would have to say that her accent was a little hokey-sounding to me in some parts, but this is a very minor flaw. It only really bothered me at one or two points in the movie. I honestly could find no flaw with Firth's performance in this; he played a really complex, multi-layered character with adroitness.The other major reason to watch this movie was just the sheer beauty of the filmmaking. Could I have expected anything else from Tom Ford? I was DROOLING over the fashion, and I'm not normally a 60's/Mad Men-type junkie.

I have yet to see a more beautiful movie. I'll explain below.The first is the play of emotions. At first Cabiria is upset after falling in the water. Then she smiles and laughs. Then she's upset. This transformation of emotions makes you throughout the movie want to see her smile. And when she laughs you're in heaven. With her. This is one reason: transformation of emotions, and your wish for Cabiria to get to laugh.The second thing that moved me with all my emotions was her reaction to sufferance. In her life she suffered before the movie (bad parents, prostitution, social status, poverty), throughout the movie (although her way of living rarely show you her sufferance in the movie, you feel she's very happy), and probably after the movie ends (again, bad future most likely). At the final part of the movie the pain is excruciating. She loses everything that connects her to the life (all her money & house), love (lover), social status (marriage) and some hope (in life and Virgin Mary). This is all in one scene. Actually, all she has left are her friends and possibly a suitcase. And then it happens: she's happy. In the very final part her reaction is: she yells, while crying, to the rubbing lover to kill her. She repeats this. And the final scene is a victory on life. Sure, her life was, is (oh, boy, what must her feelings be right now) and will be filled with pain. But he takes this reality, a certain fact, nothing's more concrete than this, and twists it: she's happy. In a face of tears, after a horrifying painful experience, she looks at the unsuspecting people around her that are joyful, happy, friendly, and takes their feeling: she smiles, almost laughing. There is no reality. The sufferance is beaten. Life has no hard touch on her. This is much more than hope. She is not wishing for a better future. She's living it now. Life is transformed with her final joy.I have yet to see a better movie. It's the one movie for which: I registered on IMDb, I voted, I read all the comments, I wrote this comment. No second place.

1925,187491,2000-07-05,coverme6,The Matrix (1999),,"""The Matrix"" is definitely a film of epic proportions. With

great, eye-popping special effects, splendidly cheographed gun

fights that would make John Woo blush, and larger-than-life

performances by the stars. When this movie first came out in mid

'99, ""Star Wars: the Phantom Menace"" was still wowing many

movie-goers. But ""The Matrix"" gave viewers a whole new ride, one

that made ""Star Wars"" look pitifully weak, and well.... DEAD!

Keanu Reeves is Thomas Anderson, AKA Neo, a mild-mannered

businessman/computer hacker, who is given the shock of his life

when he discovers that he is chosen by an elite team of

physically and mentally enhanced individuals, led by a

mysterious guru named Morpheus (played by the mystifying

Laurence Fishburne). This team shows Neo the world of the

Matrix, which is basically the real world, which our world is

basically false. Everything in the real world is in shambles

because of the fact that machines have taken order. Neo

reluctantly agrees to take part in rebelling against the

machines, battling against the agents, evil folks who mastered

the Matrix's powers who despise the rebels.

Other than the fact that the effects in this movie are dynamic,

the inspirations and philosophy behind ""The Matrix"" is also

compelling. This movie had borrowed many ideas and concepts from

other movies, such as ""Star Wars"" (the idea of using an inner

force within), ""The Terminator"" (the idea of man against

machine), ""Fight Club"" (breaking away from society), and ""Men in

Black"" (the wearing of Rayban sunglasses and the idea of joining

an elite cult and not going back to regular life).

""The Matrix"" is most probably the kind of movie that will become

a true landmark in the history of cinema; the kind that will be

a major influence to many other films to come, as did ""Star

Wars"" and ""The Terminator."" This movie practically won many

Oscar awards for effects and sound, I'm pretty surprised it

didn't win anything for performances. And what did ""The Phantom

Menace"" win? Practically nothing! Sorry, Mr. Lucas, sometimes

the competition can be EXTREMELY powerfull! """,346,0,,0,No reference

1928,2773927,2014-12-08,SimonJack,Bright Lights (1930),5.0,"""Bright Lights"" is a good example of early cinema after the advent of sound. It includes some popular actors from the silent era who transitioned well enough in sound, but whose careers lasted less than a dozen more years. Dorothy Mackaill, Frank Fay, Inez Courtney, Edward Nugent, Daphne Pollard, and Philip Strange had short careers in sound. James Murray and Edmund Breese died in the mid-1930s and Noah Beery died in 1946. Only Tom Dugan had a film career that lasted into the 1950s and ended with his death in 1955. I mention this as one reason that few of these names may be known today – other than by serious movie buffs. Mackaill was a moderately talented singer and actor who played glamor roles in a variety of film genres. But, as film technology advances leapfrogged within a few short years of sound, the competition increased. The glamor age of Hollywood was just beginning. Many new beautiful and talented actresses came on the scene. That included several multi-talented women who could also sing and/or dance. Alice Faye, Jeanette MacDonald, Deanna Durbin, Judy Garland, Eleanor Powell and Ginger Rogers had talents that dwarfed Mackaill. Mackaill made her last theatrical movie in 1937. She was just 34, and she would live to be 87. Frank Fay started in movies with sound. Although a talented actor and singer, he faced the same competition Mackaill had. But, added to his declining career was his huge ego, a drinking problem, and difficulty in working with others. His film career all but ended with three early films in the 1940s. Some viewers and the DVD sales company like to promote this as a ""pre- code"" movie. I think that's done for a lot of films that would not have much of a problem when the motion picture industry began to enforce its code in 1934. But, Mackaill was one of the stars who played roles that had provocative scenes or scantily dressed women. This film has a silhouette scene of the actress undressing behind a screen. Other than that, the chorus costumes and performances were no more revealing or suggestive than any of the many musical films from the mid-1930s onward. ""Bright Lights"" is what might be called a formulaic film of early musicals. The musicals most of us remember and enjoy from the past are those that have considerable plots. They tell the stories with musical and/or dance numbers at intervals. But, the earliest of the sound era musicals were mostly revues. They had scripts with very thin plots, if any, and were mostly staged music and dance numbers, sometimes with comedy stuck in, as in the vaudeville days. Besides this example, the technical and production aspects of ""Bright Lights"" are examples of the early transitions in film. For instance, the heavy use of makeup in this film is most obvious with Frank Fay. The acting at times seems stuck in place – probably because this was filmed with fixed microphone locations. And, the acting itself still has some twinges of melodrama – a carryover from the silent film days.There are no memorable songs from this film, and the choreography of the big numbers is rudimentary compared to later accomplished musicals. The film has a thin plot, but there are no exceptional performances. It has some historical value for a look at a handful of early actors who bowed out of films within a few short years. And, it has some value in showing the state of the film craft in its early years of transition to sound and other major advances.",598,0,,0,No reference
1929,1364536,2007-01-01,blanche-2,A Night at the Opera (1935),10.0,"""A Night at the Opera"" is one of those films you can see dozens of times and laugh just as hard as you did the first time. The brothers get mixed up with an opera company and a divo and diva in love - Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle, and trying to get the two to perform together.

The one-liners come so fast - you keep thinking you'll remember them, but one is funnier than the next. I do remember what Groucho says when he sees the gypsy Azucena in the opera, however. ""How would you like to feel how she looks?"" The stateroom scene is, of course, a classic, and my favorite part is when Groucho tells the housekeeper, ""I want two pillows on that bed"" and Harpo sound asleep and being moved everywhere, including onto a tray of food.

But nothing beats the last half hour - the performance of ""Il Trovatore"" with Harpo using the stage ropes like Tarzan, and Chico playing baseball in the orchestra while Groucho sells peanuts. They have replaced part of the overture with ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game.""

Allan Jones plays the tenor Ricardo Baroni who is hoping for his break. Why they cast the blond Jones as a tenor named Baroni - well, there you go. He sings very well and is quite handsome. Kitty Carlisle is the diva waiting, petite and pretty and singing music out of her vocal type, with the exception of ""Alone."" ""Stridono lassu"" and Leonora in Trovatore were both much too heavy for her. She does sing well and what a woman - she's still alive and recently performed at a New York supper club recently at the age of 95.

The only problem with any Marx Brothers film is that when they aren't in front of the camera, suddenly their films become very slow. Because I was trained in opera and have some interest in it, this was less the case than with some of their other films. They were too magical, too energetic, and too darn funny to ever share a spotlight with anyone else. Thank goodness they did, though, as they left us with many treasures.

The 16-minute film with Dutch subtitles has been preserved by EYE Film Institute Netherlands. The clarity is remarkable. Set in the Transvaal and directed by Otis Turner, ""Lost in the Jungle"" gives one an indication of the type of short that Selig was churning out in volume (over 160 in 1911 alone) It was a thrill to see William V. Mong in one of his early performances as Jan Kruga, the inconsiderate father of Kathlyn Williams (who was one of Selig's major stars at the time). Reportedly Williams was clawed by one of the leopards who appear, along with other animals from Selig's zoo (including Toodles the elephant). Charles Clary is also seen as the wealthy son of Frank Weed who wins Williams' heart. Although the plot is fairly predictable, the film represents a valued piece of film history.

1932,429689,2002-05-11,Mark-149,Lady in the Lake (1946),,"Shatteringly clumsy and agonizingly inept treatment of a Chandler story, totally lacking in style, variety and excitement. First impressions, for once, can be trusted: the disastrous opening scene in which Marlowe sits at his desk and *addresses the camera* gives you an utterly correct impression of the kind of cinematic screw-up you are in for. Next disaster: Robert Montgomery is a wholly uninteresting and un-charismatic actor whose attempts to portray the fast-talking, back-chatting Marlowe frequently come across as merely nasty. Failure Number Three is the ludicrous decision to film the entire story as a series of 'point-of-view' shots, giving us a 'Marlowe's-eye-view' of what little there is to see (Don't miss the bit where Marlowe crawls on his hands and knees - and we see the backs of his hands - before going on to use a telephone - when, gosh, we find ourselves looking at a telephone...). The two-fold pointlessness of the continual P.O.V. beggars belief: first, because it throws the weight on supporting players whose third-rate skills cannot carry it; second, because the fact that we have to watch a series of long, unbroken, unvaried, UNINTERESTING takes - in which whoever Marlowe is talking to simply faces the camera 'square-on' and talks 'back' to it - make vast stretches of the film UNBEARABLY TEDIOUS to watch and the details incredibly difficult to take in. Directors don't cut, employ 'reverse angles', reaction shots, profiles and so on for no reason. Fourth problem: removing Marlowe almost entirely from the visible action removes a lot of useful possibilities and adds PRECISELY NONE. Fifth problem: when Marlowe *is* actually visible, all we see is some lug talking to the camera - whereas a 'voice-over' would at least let us see something *different* happening. And why angle the story as a 'solve-it-yourself' mystery when *everyone* tries hard to work out a Chandler plot anyway? All in all, the results are so abysmal that one asks oneself how it could possibly have come to be done that way. Well, here are my suggestions. First, Bogart is a tough act to follow: by putting Marlowe out of view here, someone must have thought they were avoiding unfortunate comparisons. Second, look who the director is: yes, it's wooden leading man Robert Montgomery, who plainly can't see how bad his direction is when he's acting, and won't see (or hear) how bad his acting is when he's directing. Someone has bitten off more than they can chew - and this is the result: an unwatchable, saggy mess that manages to be significantly less interesting than 90 minutes spent putting your books in alphabetical order.",437,0,,0,No reference
1933,2919455,2015-08-12,mdroel20,Springsteen and I (2013),8.0,"It is debatable, but I don't know if there are more passionate fans than Bruce Springsteen fans. Sure, they don't have a nickname like Grateful Dead's ""Deadheads,"" but they don't need one. Ballie Walsh's documentary, Springsteen & I, drives this point home in the most unique of ways. Almost the entire film was created using fan-made videos about what Springsteen means to them. This documentary did not call for pro-shot, high definition videos. That was not the mission. These videos were mostly shot on cellphones, some on laptops, but the quality didn't matter. What mattered were the stories, the emotion, and the gratitude these fans needed to express.Some poignant moments include one man sobbing uncontrollably at the thought of the characters in Bruce's songs and their hardships while another man states, ""Bruce taught me to be a man, a decent man."" These stories show the admiration fans have for him and the influence his music has on his listeners. In addition, many clips show experiences fans have had with Bruce that you would think unimaginable had they not been told in this film. One fan, who was a factory worker in England, made his way to New York City to see a Bruce concert. Unfortunately, his ticket was for the very last row in Madison Square Garden. Miraculously, a bearded man, who was apart of Bruce's camp, approached him to upgrade his ticket prior to the show. The man found his way to the front row, astonished that this had just happened to him. Another fan, who spent his time as a Elvis impersonator, had the lifelong dream of joining Bruce onstage one day. At a Philadelphia show in 2009, this man's dream came true, as Bruce pulled him onstage to perform All Shook Up and Blue Suede Shoes. These stories are incredible, and could only happen at a Bruce concert. He is arguably the most genuine rock star and this movie emphasizes that idea. Walsh concludes the movie with what may be the most telling account of Bruce's passion for his fans. As Bruce concludes his meet and greet with a young man from the film, he takes off one of his bracelets, ties it around this young man's wrist and declares, ""this is a sign of brotherhood.""",379,0,,0,No reference

It was totally his role that no one else could do justice with. Karan Johar again gives us three hours of magical entertainment, but I personally think that making the film go for 2:30 hours and cutting off some unnecessary and less viewer engaging scenes would have made the whole experience even better.

Nothing really innovating, of course, but the important thing is that this indie-film has its heart at the right place. The creature is just a (very big) man but in a rather impressive hairy monster-suit. It's got a really big, fiercely mouth with a whole lot of pointy teeth in it, though his red eyes might have you chuckle a bit. Another natural ingredient in these type of movies (and the filmmakers know it) comes in the shape of Tiffany Shepis, generously showing all of her skin in a shower-scene. Adding a protagonist that's wheelchair-bound was also a nice angle (though done before, of course, with him not being able to leave the house while he's witnessing all the gruesome goings-on through his binoculars). Add a little bit of gore here & there and an end-shot that you just need to have in a movie like this, and you basically have a winner of a creature feature.

I am reminded a lot of Rolling Thunder, which is still quite different than this and actually predates the original First Blood movie by several years.

The only thing I maybe wasn't too big on was the actual wild cat showing up at the very end, so the film finishes weaker than it is for the most part and as most people tend to remember endings fairly well, this is maybe the reason why it is not the most-known of these many Garfield cartoons. Or among the most known you could say too. The funny comment by Garfield at the very end could not make up for that either.

He's the cinematographer, editor and the director himself.Farogh Jafri is their screenplay writer with his Urdu language and diction perfect (Believe me, I was stunned to see him ripping apart a pseudo journalist on his misuse of language, later the press screening). He had made a very strong and a clap-worthy point in this documentary: ""Be it a film as grand as Titanic or as cheap as Malegaon Ka Superman, the real pain is suffered by the writer as he is the only one who lives with the characters. Only 20% of the writer's imagination finds way into the film, the rest 80% stays with him as a pain which no money can compensate."" Mr. Jafri: RESPECT. Like every film, Nasir says, this too has a hero (our superman Shafique), a villain (Akram Khan) and a heroine (Trupti). Where the villain wants to spread filth everywhere and wants every child to spit around, the match-stick thin Superman fights every odd, from bursting into a rickshaw to getting dragged into a gutter by the school bus, to save his heroine. Superman Shafique while shooting also does other odd jobs but aspire to make it as big as Amitabh Bachhan one day. Sad that he died the next day when Malegaon Ka Superman was screened. May his soul rest in peace.Faiza Ahmad Khan's documentary delightfully portrays the parallel kind of film-making revolving around the shoot of Malegaon Ka Superman that is so engrossing that you'll forget that you are watching a documentary. And there you learn how ordinary looking men, working at hand-looms burns a fiery passion within themselves to earn a living and live their hobbies at the same time. Indeed, they are the Supermen of Malegaon.",618,0,,0,No reference

On one hand, I found Matt Ryan's return as John Constantine to be full of charisma and fresh energy, but I ultimately did not care for the exorcism based plot.It's always nice to see the show attempt at new genres and while the show flirted with a horror-themed episode a few times in the front half of this season, 'Daddy Darhkest' was most certainly a full-blown horror episode. However, there's no denying that this episode is riddled with horror cliches and uninspired plot choices. To this point in the season, I haven't been outright upset with the show's use of Damien Darhk, but it often feels unnecessary. With the revelation that Mallus is the true big bad of this season, I'm beginning to care less and less about Darhk and his daughter's whereabouts.Sure, it's always fun to watch Neal McDonough do his thing, but the wandering direction this season feels indicative of the Arrowverse year as a whole. Hopefully the rest of the season can regain its focus and deliver the best season on CW so far in the 2017-2018 TV year. Albeit, that's not saying a whole lot.7.4/10",208,0,,0,No reference
1960,861040,2004-12-01,Snow Leopard,The Gaucho (1927),,"Combining the familiar Douglas Fairbanks action scenes with some unexpected material, ""The Gaucho"" is interesting and pretty good. It might be just a cut below Fairbanks's very best movies, but it has more than enough to satisfy most silent movie fans. The story is involved, and it features some creative turns, while the production is resourceful and quite good for the most part.Fairbanks's character here is not quite the same as in his usual roles. While the story does give him plenty of action and adventure sequences, his character is not nearly as likable as most of the ones that he played. The way that ""The Gaucho"" treats the other characters is not at all what you would have expected from his other movies - normally, even when his character is an outlaw in the eyes of the authorities, you get the feeling that you'd have nothing to fear from him unless you deserved it. Not so here.That does make the character interesting. As with Fairbanks's usual roles, he seeks justice and respect, but unlike most of the others, he also needs redemption in a much deeper sense. And that fits in well with the other unusual aspect of the movie, which is established at the very beginning with the founding of the miraculous shrine. It introduces a supernatural or quasi-religious dimension that is not at all part of movies like ""The Black Pirate"" or ""The Three Musketeers"". Yet, for all that it requires a suspension of disbelief, it works pretty well as part of the overall story.The detailed and sometimes impressive settings, along with the supporting cast, also help out. Lupe Velez has plenty of energy, Gustav von Seyffertitz is a suitable villain, and it's enjoyable to see Mary Pickford's brief appearance. Overall, it's pretty good, despite varying in some respects from time-tested formulas.",305,0,,0,No reference

I enjoyed it. Same as the decor, the scenery goes all out. It looked really nice. Just wished the story was a little less teenage-drama, I guess. Gave it three stars initially. I did however watched season 1 to 4 so I must have enjoyed something. The part with Alie was the fun part I think. I guess because it was the most coherent part. Though the first two and a half seasons I was about to scratch out my eyes out for keeping up. Raised it to four stars. Think it should be somewhere in between. The unbelievable plot-twists and sloppiness throughout the story-line, especially in the first two-and-a-half seasons are what tips it to the negative side of the scale for me.

Not so oddly, none of this occurs in the movie, and the intended assassination has nothing at all to do with the tango. It could be that as a writer and director, Robert Duvall is a much better actor. In fact, I consider him my favorite modern day actor on the strength of such films as ""Open Range"" and ""The Judge"", not to mention the 'Godfather' films he appeared in. But here he just seems out of his league in a picture that meanders around in search of a compelling story line. In particular, the circumstances surrounding the Argentinian collaborators, Orlando (Julio Mechoso) and Miguel (Ruben Blades) was handled very weakly. Their apprehension by authorities was explained after the fact by a bug in John J's (Duvall) room, but it just seemed a very lazy rationale with a noticeable lack of intrigue. Regarding the 'tango' part of the story, I thought the dancers, Luciana Pedraza as Manuela, and Geraldine Rojas as Pirucha, were exceptional in their roles, but would have better served the story if their characters weren't so passive. Maybe this could all be fixed with a re-write in which Robert Duvall plays the part of The Tango Assassin.",227,0,,0,No reference

The issues of identity and belonging these students face is portrayed so well in Rahul Gandotra's ""Road Home."" I frequently show the trailer to students, parents and teachers to explain why these children are different - their international living experiences make them very different from most of theirs peers - as well as what it means to be the ""hidden immigrant,"" as Pollock and Van Reken call them in their book, ""Third Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds."" They may look and even sound like their home-country peers but because of their broadened world view, they do not think or act like them. This leads to many expectations being placed on those children - ones that go largely unmet.

Gandotra's sensitive messages come out loud and clear. Anyone who has ever struggled with answering the question, ""Where are you from?"" should see his film.

I understand what he was trying to say, and I agree, glorifying violence is a problem in our society, but it was just too much.It's like when you first learn how to use editing effects, you want to use them on everything. But you soon grow to understand that less is more. This goes along with his use of violence also.There's a great scene in the deleted scenes where a witness (Ashley Judd) from one of the Mickey/Mallory massacres testifies in court. That scene is the best scene of the entire film. I haven't the faintest idea of why Stone cut it out of the final version. I think he should have dropped some of the other violent scenes (perhaps some of jail scenes?) and kept this in the film -and its still a violent scene, but it justifies the message Stone is trying to get across much better (when the audience in the court laughs as he mocks the victim about the killing of her brother, etc.).I was disappointed.

In my opinion, John Goodman should've been picked for this particular role because he definitely had Gleason's build and look. Don't get me wrong--Garrett did a good job, but Goodman would've carried that role VERY far.This movie covered Gleason's childhood years in a broken home, his stand-up comedy career, his marriage and his various infidelities, as well as his early days in television up until the time of ""The Honeymooners""; but what the film didn't cover (but should have) was his later life beyond ""The Honeymooners"" and his major Hollywood works, from the tearjerker ""Gigot"" (one of my all-time favorite films) to the hilarious ""Smokey and the Bandit"" movies.This film would have merited a rating a ten from me, but I gave it a seven because of the casting choice of Brad Garrett and the film's failure to show us the complete career of Jackie Gleason, who will always be The Great One in the hearts of his many fans.",216,0,,0,No reference
1969,2035619,2010-10-23,johnnyboyz,Le silence de Lorna (2008),8.0,"When we first see the protagonist of 2008 Belgian film The Silence of Lorna, they are flitting around the general area in which they habit; darting from the shops, back through the streets and then home again to an unwelcoming and droll apartment. Their partner is home, smoking and listening to loud rock music. The partner apologises and tells the lead that they'll stop going out and doing what it is they're doing, an exchange that we feel may have just played out for the umpteenth time. The home quarters are colourless and drab, the walls undecorated and furniture sparse – perhaps they've just moved in, perhaps they're really poor or maybe something more sinister is going on. We wonder what the ragged looking partner does that forces them to be as apologetic as they are, the suggestion that they play a friendly game of cards together might itself suggest a gambling problem; the manner in which the partner is shot, that is to say from behind, gets across a sense of anonymity or alienation about them on first sighting, particularly in regards to how the character feels towards them. Very quickly, the Dardenne brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc have caught us up in the world of these people through their realist style and wonderful techniques; a sensation that does not abate until the very end.The lead is the titular Lorna (Dobroshi), a young woman; an Albanian immigrant living illegally within the Belgian city of Leige and in a false, loveless marriage to the aforementioned partner who's named Claudy (Renier). Lorna's a simple enough girl with relatively attainable aspirations although living amidst a complicated scheme, her tone quiet; her dress sense normalised and in Kosovo born actress Arta Dobroshi, an uncomplicated; unspectacular; unknown acting quantity whom carries a close to all but innocent expression on her face throughout as grins at the situation she's in and bears it. Lorna already has a partner away from Claudy whom is also Albanian, a man named Sokol (Ukaj), and has her eye on a disused structure sitting idly on a plot of land that she one day hopes to turn into a snack bar-come-restaurant with him so as to bring in the cash. Her confidant is a local gangster with broader connections to a Russian criminal organisation; somebody we feel she'd have absolutely nothing to do with ordinarily – a cab driver named Fabio (Rongione) whom is able to access her the necessary items needed to live in Belgium out from under this shroud of seediness and falsity.The film is a wonderful, involving mediation on the morality that comes with most of the actions, reactions and scenarios of what Lorna is facing within the film. Living with a man as unappealing as she does; using somebody else for her own gain and breaking international rules so as to be in a designated place are crimes she has either committed or is on the way to committing before the film has even begun. Complications that arise later on with the organisation of somebody's death stretch the band a tad too much for poor Lorna, and it's then she realises the trouble her actions have put both her, and those around her, in. The Dardenne's balance this agonising central character study and the torn morals that come with it with the back-burning gangsters whom oppose Lorna's anti cut-throat ideas of divorce because they incur police involvement. The result is a beautifully crafted and solid piece of drama that's gripping from its humble beginnings right through to its terrifying finale.By day, Lorna works in a laundromat steaming sheets and pressing clothes and so forth. The job entails pressing out and washing out both the grime and creases from numerous sheets which come in, something that echos what she has going on in her private life as her very soul begins to collect the grime and the creases that come with operating within the world she's operating and dealing with the people she's dealing. The grime threatens to reach a breaking point, so much so that a ploy to organise a case of faux-domestic abuse involving Claudy may just be enough to at least save his life as the Russians plan to simply have him overdose; a death which is clearly a step too far from Lorna's perspective and something far too weighty for her conscience to take.The film is a quietly murky piece, and it's this event which does so well in capturing this overlying canopy. Lorna and Claudy being forced by way of the state of desperation they're in to forge a domestic abuse scenario in which one is the victim and one the aggressor. The agonising planning of this event; the excruciating practising of it that must be completed prior to the execution proper and then the fallout which unfolds as a result of it are individual instances that manifest because of what these desperate characters have got themselves involved in. This being a film about process, about processes and the tortuous carrying out of a number of procedures so as to hopefully spawn a fresher, more hopeful dawn is captured wonderfully by the two sibling directors. There's a coldness to proceedings, a detached sense of everybody within the film not liking one another at all although never daring to actually admit it with the long takes that're applied handled expertly: the emotions of pain; frustration; anger and weakness which begins to manifest within numerous characters gradually rearing themselves on the faces within. The film is a brilliant character study, an unnerving thriller and a quite brilliant piece.",933,0,,0,No reference

On one occasion Richard finds Pat with another man, when Harry realizes that his girl friend Kay is having an affair with his best friend Richard and his wife is having an affair with some other man  he gets back to being with his wife in the end.The movie is slow and unfolds at its own pace. It does not have any that extra bit of suspense around the story. The versatile actors do not fill life in the set-up which is said to be of 1940s  though it looks pretty much like 90s décor. The Director Ira Sachs tries to brings twists and turns, and incorporate suspense  but I think, his style does not sustain interest to make the movie rise above the ordinary.Among performances  they are generally above average, but nobody stands out as good or great. Chris Cooper is the best, followed by very handsome and good looking Pierce Brosnan, who at times brings charm to the screen with his presence and style.The best part of the movie was the quote at the end of the movie that I loved  If anyone who knows what is going on the mind of the person sitting next to you, please raise your hand.

First off, many people love to bash this movie because they loath George Lucas. They say that it does not compare to A New Hope or Empire. Well, maybe it doesn't. But perhaps part of the reason for this is simply that many of us were young impressionable children in 1977 or 1980 and so we were more likely to be overwhelmed by a picture (any picture) than we are today.Having said that, I will say that this movie certainly has its flaws. Unlike a lot of people, I did not find the visual effects to be as impressive as some viewers. A great deal of the effects reminded of a high tech video game. The performance of Hayden Christensen was not exceptional but okay. Natalie Portman did a fine job. The story still seems a little empty to me, in terms of information that Lucas has yet to cover (i.e.: the Solo family, the conversion of Anakin to Vader, Anakin's children, Grand Moff Tarkin and so on).

Director Craig Johnson did a nice job of allowing this same sense of freedom on set of The Skeleton Twins. Hader and Wiig's relationship seemed so genuine. In addition, some scenes crossed me as being unstructured, which allowed Hader and Wiig to do what they are known for, improvising. ""Genuine"" is not a word I use often to describe movies, because, quite frankly, there aren't many genuine movies. The rapport between Hader and Wiig made this movie.",159,0,,0,No reference

1987,2607425,2014-02-07,mgruebel,Clash of the Titans (2010),4.0,"""Timeo danaos, et dona ferentes,"" as Julius Caesar himself said. Perseus is the legendary founding father of the Mycean Danaans, but in this film, beware of what he bears: a lackluster performance in a lackluster remake.The plot substitutes Hades for Poseidon as the wrathful God, and Perseus' female chaperone Io for princess Andromeda. The main purpose of the latter seems to be to allow a female character to tag along for the quest; maybe not necessary when you are making a teen-boy action film.The strangest thing about this movie is the mash-up of special effect elements from other fantasy films, rather than coming up with its own elements. For instance, we have Ray Harryhausen's scorpions blown to gigantic size, so like the oliphaunts in ""The Lord of the Rings"" they can bear tents on their backs guided by desert people.The script writing is weak (Perseus curses ""like hell"" a lot, instead of ""like Hades""; his motive is base revenge instead of noble love and salvation; etc) and derivative (of the original and LOTR of all things!), the characters are pretty anemic, with the Gods more human than the humans.A mediocre film than can be watched once, not bad enough to get upset about, not good enough to displace any of the memes created by Harryhausen for the Perseus myth.",219,0,,0,No reference
1988,5225554,2020-09-06,walkingwithprimeval,Robot Jox (1989),7.0,"The premise of this post-apocalyptic, sci-fi action B-movie is certainly an interesting one. It takes place in a post-World War III setting and by this point in the far distant future, people have grown weary of the constant heartache that war brings about (which has since been outlawed in this dystopian world for many years now, so it's illegal for a hostile army to violently engage in enemy territory). To quickly resolve the serious conflict of a political issue in rapid succession, they resort to picking the fittest military soldier from each country to control weaponised, heavy machinery (constructed in a human-like shape), built for the purpose of close-combat warfare on a big gladiatorial battlefield to determine who's nation is the winner (thus settling the dispute).The special effects are exactly what you'd expect from around this time... really awesome! It's a good combination of convincing stop-motion models and animatronic miniatures (both of these techniques help to give off that jerky, stiff movement which seems more robotic), in which all the scenes with the futuristic giant robots were achieved by using trick photography to make them appear much larger than they actually were in real-life (it all felt so seamlessly put together). The film's producer was Albert Band and the stop-motion animation was done by David W. Allen, who would later go on to provide more of his effects heavy work in another one of Band's movies, Doctor Mordrid - Master of the Unkown (1992) by Full Moon Entertainment.They certainly knew how to make movies the practical way back then, didn't they? And more to the point, this is proof that a live-action Transformers film could've been made in the '80s. You can just tell that the studio really gave it their all when making this movie, as it has some pretty high production value when compared to the quality of their other film projects. But I guess the production company went a little overboard on the budgetary costs, seeing as though it was this visually-impressive movie that ultimately contributed to them eventually going bankrupt by the end of the decade. So in a sense, this was Empire Pictures' swansong.People have always gone on talking about the social commentary in this film, but I honestly never looked into it all that deeply before (either I didn't notice on my first few viewings, or it really was just too subtle for me to pick up on). Since the baby-making propaganda and infamous Cold War tension (which was still kind of going on around that time) seem to be frequent things that people often bring up a lot in conversation when discussing this movie, then maybe Paul Verhoeven, of RoboCop (1987) fame, would've been a more fitting choice to do the film instead of Stuart Gordon. Now, I'm not saying anything negative about Gordon as a director. All I'm stating is the fact that someone like Verhoeven could've given it more of a standout, satirical edge with his clever style of filmmaking.You might think this film sounds ridiculously cheesy, but it's just a simple joy in life (whether you're a little kid filled with imagination, or a grown adult who's become jaded over time) to watch two mechanised Titans fighting one another to see who comes out on top as victorious. With the advent of today's computer-generated imagery, the special effects for robots aren't what they used to be. It seems as though they can never get it just right, as the modern CGI-created robots are a little too swift, flexible and weightless, like in Shawn Levy's Real Steel (2011). I think the only one that got it right in recent years was Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim (2013), where you could actually feel the heavy weight and bulky mass of the Jaegers as they moved onscreen.",634,0,,0,No reference

1990,479182,2002-08-21,jjschneider,Black Hawk Down (2001),,"This movie is an uncomfortable, agonizing film for all the gore and feelings of utter helplessness evoked.  The shock value of Saving Private Ryan's opening 25 minutes has now been expanded into a feature length film. Whether this is entertainment or not may be argued.  What is not at issue is that the death, desperation, thirst, and mayhem lasted considerably longer than the 2 hour investment the viewer is asked to make.  While it may elevate the Rangers (NOT Texas Rangers) and the Delta Force to hero status, their sacrifices were certainly worthy of it.  Reviewers who take the film to task as glorifying the American military are embarrassingly ignorant of the history of US/UN involvement in that country.Many reviewers have taken the producers and writers to task for not providing a balanced and more charitable view of the Somalis.  Indeed, this is true.  Like most non-fiction books, the book is better than the translated film version.  I saw the movie before reading Mark Bowden's excellent book which I recommend to anyone seeking an intellectual recounting of the events in Mogadishu.  But it is after all a movie and only that.  A documentary has been done already - the PBS show ""Frontline"" recounted US involvement in Somalia and is also recommended to anyone seeking a dispassionate analysis.In any final analysis, Aided is dead and Somalia still has no viable government.

It looks like, as advertised, that if you enjoyed the ""Bourne"" movies (""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"") you should like this and that was the case with me.....for the first hour. Mark Walhber's ""Bob Lee Swagger"" is a likable hero, a good guy in every sense. Yes, he's macho, intelligent, a thoughtful, patriotic guy, etc.. The scenes where he is eluding everyone in Philadelphia in what would be an impossible dragnet lack a little credibility but they sure are fun to watch.The first half included an interesting study on what it takes to be a good ""sniper."" It also had good photography and I especially liked the overhead shots of Philadelphia. The chase scenes were fun to watch, too. Near the end, the white sniper camouflage outfit Walhberg was wearing in Montana was really cool.THE BAD - Who wrote this script? Oliver Stone? Michael Moore? The DNC? I couldn't believe all the politics - all the Liberal conspiracies and the anti-Bush Administration comments - in the last hour of this movie. First, this extreme paranoid view that everyone in the government is corrupt is vastly overworked by Hollywood and this movie is the topper where they aren't even subtle about these crackpot theories. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you! Filmmakers make literally millions of dollars in this country and do nothing but bash the government. It's really worked to death in this film, more than the Bourne stories. To what extremes film writers go, just check out Elias Koteas' portrayal of government agent in here, and you get my drift. No guy in that position would act like that. The Oliver Stone-like politics come into play big-time when Swagger meets this old guy in Tennessee who espouses every Liberal conspiracy theory that Stone likes to dish out. They still are trying to pass on all the conspiracy theories on the JFK assassination. That, and a not-so-subtle dig at WMDs, President Bush's comments why we are in Iraq, the Secretary of Defense supposedly being a liar and other negative opinions connected with the Iraq War, just keep coming after that. It's unrelenting. They turn a decent action thriller into one big Left Wing propaganda piece. They didn't do that in the Bourne movies, but they sure spew out their political venom in here.That's bad enough but the Rambo-mentality was an insult to all viewers, regardless of political persuasion. There had to be at least 50 trained army guys storming a house with our hero in it, along with his FBI friend, and all 50 guys are killed and the two ""good guys"" don't even get a scratch?! Then, a helicopter arrives with more guys shooting at them, and Swagger kills all of them, too! This is embarrassingly moronic.OVERALL - After a great first hour, this movie dumbed down so badly in the second half that it just left me shaking my head in disbelief! How a film can be so entertaining and somewhat intelligent and go down the dumper so fast and be so stupid in the second half is staggering. It winds up being a ""coulda, shoulda"" movie in which we just lament how good this should have been, but wasn't",556,0,,0,No reference
1993,3532618,2018-03-09,WubsTheFadger,War of the Worlds (2005),6.0,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerGangbusters effects and terrific camerawork propel Steven Spielberg's film well into its last act, when it runs out of energy and ideas. This collapse is especially disappointing because War of the Worlds begins as a provocative look at how terror affects family and community, that is, something more complicated than an explosion movie. If the first part of the film offers an absorbingly detailed look at the family's dysfunction, the ride in the minivan tightens the focus, as they struggle to make sense of the disaster unfolding around them. ""Is it terrorists?"" asks Rob. No, says Dad, this ""came from someplace else."" Rob tries again: ""What do you mean, like Europe?"" This brief comedy only sharpens the scares that follow, not all caused by aliens. Indeed, two of the most awful scenes involve people fighting each other.This and other particulars -- a monstrous surveillance eye on a sinuous, seemingly endless arm invades Harlan's basement; clothes from disintegrated victims float through tree branches; a peanut butter sandwich Ray has thrown at the kitchen window slides almost imperceptibly down the glass as he wonders what to do next; Ray asks a man who appears to have survived a plane crash, ""Are you a passenger?"" -- create a potent mix of recognizable and fantastic moments.

1994,2201960,2011-11-06,alanrayford,Hawaii Five-0 (2010–2020),5.0,"The first five episodes of Hawaii 5-0's debut season were extremely well done. The same is to be said of both the first season finale and the second season premiere. However, the remaining twenty-four episodes of the thirty-one which have aired are nowhere close to being in the same league. Matter of fact, they're boring. I usually don't turn in until around 2:00 a.m. and am wide awake when 5-0 comes on. But this series does something to me, and I usually end up falling asleep for fifteen to twenty minutes per episode. Upon using On Demand to review what I've missed, I'm always left feeling disappointed. The common outburst is something like WTF.

The first season was rough. Sadly the second season doesn't appear to be doing anything except heading in the wrong direction. Case in point, I'll bring up the addition of Lauren Weston (Lauren German). In what weird, Bizarro universe way is she supposed to convincingly portray an elite police officer? She's too young and too slight. It feels like a lazy attempt to boosts 5-0's appeal to the female demo. And that's what the overall problem with this series is. It's so unbelievably forking lazy on all motorforking levels.

The acting is lazy. By birth, by training and by choice, I wouldn't even dream about being an actor. Yet, I can still tell the difference between acting and pretending. Most of the shows I watch (Person of Interest, Supernatural, Once Upon a Time, and Terra Nova) feature actors and actresses doing their jobs. Hawaii 5-0's cast, on the other hand, can only pretend. McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin), Danno (Scott Caan), Chin Ho (Daniel Dae Kim) and Kono (Grace Park) don't feel like cops—even if their names do rhyme. They can stand around, bark orders and spout terminology until they're blue in the face. But, unlike the casts of the L&O and CSI franchises, the leads here can't quite seem to connect with the situation or their surroundings when it doesn't involve running with firearms. Speaking of which

the action is lazy. Ninety percent of the action scenes involve a foot chase between McGarrett and a perp, covering almost half a mile of terrain. They'll jump across low level rooftops, scale fences, roll over car hoods and otherwise live out their childhood ninja fantasies. When McGarrett catches up, there'll be a fight scene. It will be overly choreographed, tightly edited, super stylistic and feel 100% fake. After sprinting a few blocks with your sidearm out and up, it's only natural you'd be up to some high falootin' CQC rather than shooting or puking or both. This is why, when these scenes start, I yawn. They only seem to exist to demonstrate how hyper athletic and tough Steve-O is (now his name rhymes with everyone else's).

The casting is lazy. Hawaii 5-0 relies almost fanatically on high profile guest stars. So far, there've been over twenty including such notables as Peter Fonda, Kevin Sorbo and Rick Springfield. Yet, only Sean Combs had a role which qualified as more than a mere walk on cameo. You can tell the others used this show to see Hawaii on CBS's dollar. Smart and shameless on their part? Hell yes. Lazy and wasteful on the casting director's part? You betcha'.

The writing is perhaps the laziest, most uninspired aspect of this piecemeal show. Did anyone believe Chin Ho's head was going to be blown off? Did anyone think McGarrett would spend more than a second in prison before being reinstated with honors? Did anyone buy Kono as being a crooked cop and not working undercover? The answer should be no, unless you spend your free time diddling chickens while eating glue.

Furthermore, the writing is also too lazy to develop any character besides McGarrett and Danno. Kono often has nothing to do from episode from episode, save take notes and preen. Chin Ho feels like he could become a draw, but is always relegated to playing second fiddle. Yet, every episode is rife with McGarrett/Danno banter that's gone from being funny to forced to insipid and is now edging into homoeroticism. The more I see of Danno's private life, his estranged relationship with his wife, his daughter and the very air he breathes, the more I wish he'd fall into a volcano (my apologies to the volcano). Also, by making McGarrett into such a one man wrecking crew and not developing anyone else's capabilities, the writers have made the other characters redundant. If McGarrett's smarter than Danno and Weston, faster than Kono and tougher than Chin Ho, then why does the show need them?

Hawaii 5-0 has potential. A handful of episodes will attest to this. But due to its uninspired acting, action, casting directors, writers and probably even caterers, there's nothing to it. This honestly doesn't feel like a police procedural or action show. It feels more like an advertisement for a lifestyle, like Miami Vice was. Everything's nice and pretty to look at. Everything's cool and ultra stylized. But there isn't anything to hold this together. There isn't anything to make you feel invested in the characters or the situations beyond an extremely superficial level.

Hawaii 5-0 has all the earmarks of a flash in the pan show. It's one of those programs people will think about and be embarrassed to admit they watched, worked on or produced. The only thing keeping it from becoming a memory is no other network thinking to do a similar, but better show in the same time slot. Given what I've seen so far, something better wouldn't be hard to manage. Should this occur, Hawaii 5-0 dies within weeks.

Now, to be a nice guy and not such a Gloomy Gus, I'll close this review with a compliment. The colors are very lush and vibrant. They nearly succeed in masking how hollow and insubstantial this show is. Once againnearly.",985,0,,0,No reference

1996,1320471,2006-10-30,losingselfalive,Death of a President (2006),,"The concept of the ""mockumentary"" has been around for years. Popularized in films such as This is Spinal Tap or Best In Show, it involves a documentary style of interviewing fictional characters about their fictional lives. Even The Office on TV (a show you really should be watching) can fall under the mockumentary header. A fictional dramatic documentary, an oxymoron in terms if you think about it, is different and comes with a new set of problems. Yeah, maybe you could classify some of Michael Moore's work under that category, but the movie I'm talking about isn't ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", it's ""Death Of A President"". And while ""Death"" may have an unnerving style, and even be quite powerful at times, its central gimmick is hard to sustain for the entire runtime and it ends up being exactly what a documentary shouldn't be: kinda dull.

Using existing footage and sound bites of the current U.S. Administration, Director Gabriel Range has crafted a documentary style drama about the death of current American President George W. Bush. The ""documentary"" involves interviews with featured players, protesters, secret service, police, FBI, accused assassins, who were involved on the day of the President's assassination in October, 2007. Setting the story sometime in the near future, and dropping references to week-old headlines like Nuclear North Korea, makes the film seem eerily prescient. Its like you're watching a newsreel from the future. Very trippy and unsettling.

These early scenes are definitely the best. When George Bush lands in Chicago, there are hundreds of angry, angsty, protesters are waiting on the ground for him. The level of hatred in these scenes, empathized by cutting away to the protesters banging war-drums and chanting, feels almost palatable. Some very good music underneath contributes to the mood. And the faux-interviews with sad-looking government spooks who failed to protect the President feels genuinely emotional. At this moment, the film's spell holds you in its dark sway. You know something bad is about to happen and you feel powerless to prevent it.

But, after the assassination, the momentum grinds to a halt. Just like that, the George W. Snuff Film (which is what you can essentially boil the flick down to) has happened, and you're starring at a good solid hour's worth of fake documentary ahead of you. Like the President's heart, the movie flatlines rather unexpectedly and never recovers. The second act of the movie is the weakest: it involves a lot of investigating and accusations that's hard to get into.

Suddenly, with the dramatic tension removed, all of the characters revert to clichés: the protester suspects are come across as dirty, amoral hippies, the investigators come across as jack boot fascists, the nerdy forensics guy who talks about searching for evidence looks like he stumbled out of the scientist cliché-nerd character workshop, and more. Probably the most disappointing development is how the movie paints Dick Cheney as immediately being hell-bent on pinning the assassination on Evil Boogeyman Syria without a single shred of proof. Yeah, the real Darth Cheney is a dick, but this portrayal just feels like transparent ""U.S.A Is Not O.K."" pontificating. If the filmmakers want to sustain a level of believability that this event actually happened, a documentary should be impartial.

However, after dragging through the 2nd act, we get a few involving and dramatic twists to the storyline. Told mostly through interviews of the individuals involved, all well acted, the movie suddenly hooks back into what made it so compelling at the beginning: the emotional core of watching a documentary and people telling their stories. The assassination may wrap up a little too neatly, but as a dramatic ending, it works astonishingly well and emotionally.

From a technical standpoint, keeping the fiction alive and having real individuals talk about the assassination holds together. There's some good CGI manipulation at work to place the President in a certain situation, and very slick voice editing. Sometimes. Other times it can get to be a little hokey. The few back-of-the-head shots of people like George W. Bush kept reminding me of how George Steinbrenner was portrayed on Sinefeld. And while the splicing together of speeches by public figures is done okay, other times it's just really, really lame. A prime example of this is when Cheney is eulogizing Bush, and inserting the President's name is done rather inelegantly. Ever seen that episode of The Simpsons where Krusty The Clown's video has him mouthing a different name and someone else says, ""Mr. Black""? Yeah, its that bad.

""Death"" has a tense opening, surprisingly powerful and poignant ending, and some reallllyyy long and dry procedural stuff in the middle. If you open and end well, most of the middle is forgivable. As a purely intellectual exercise in how easily documentaries can be constructed, it's worth a glance. ""Death of a President"" is definitely unconventional, outside-of-the-box film-making. But, at its core, its a shock-value gimmick movie and the gimmick can't sustain the entire running time.

Anyway, seriously, you can find better told stories involving the death of presidents by going out and renting ""J.F.K."" or picking up Season 5 of ""24"". And ""Death of A President"" doesn't have anything nearly as cool as Kiefer Sutherland yelling, ""RIGHT HERE! RIGHT NOW! YOU ARE GOING TO FACE JUSTICE!!!"" Considering how dull the flick can get, it could have used a little bit of Jack Bauer.",898,0,,0,No reference

This premise sets up Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996) to be a blend of ""Bewitched"" and ""Mean Girls"".This teen movie belongs to the ""high-school-queen-bee-gets-her-comeuppance"" sub-genre of which there are endless examples. Apparently there is a huge viewing demographic who on some basic level repeatedly get off erotically or emotionally on this humiliation dynamic. The friendship and coming-of-age elements are almost incidental to the story.More central for your thinking viewer are the moral dilemma and ethical considerations raised by the story. Sabrina competes with other girls in track and field events; winning several of them by using her powers to cheat. Little effort is made to show her in any sort of quandary over her decision to cheat. The story hedges a bit on this issue, as her magic is mostly used in response to unwarranted attacks by her rival; but in several of the track & field events her cheating makes losers out of all the other participants and no attempt is made at rationalization or justification.The problem with casting someone like Melissa Joan Hart as your good girl love interest is the absence of even a hint of physical sizzle. Which means that to stay remotely credible with viewers, the bad girl she plays off has to be several erotic levels below Megan Fox; hence Tori Spelling lookalike Lalainia Lindbjerg as Katy Lemore (apparently a play on L'Amore). And Hart's rival Libby in the 1996-2003 series would be played by the even less sizzling Jenna Leigh Green. Which makes their inevitable comeuppances almost sterile. And since Katy does not rank especially high on the queen bee badness scale Sabrina's extreme revenge is way out of proportion. To appreciate the missed opportunity just check out Samantha's inspired abuse of rival Sheila Sommers (played by gorgeous Nancy Kovack) in several episodes of ""Bewitched"".But the producers should get some credit for a glammed up Katy in the ""Zapped"" (1982) inspired final comeuppance scene. Although Sabina has tortured Katy throughout the movie she saves the most extreme for the end, reducing her rival to a disheveled and whimpering wreck. With this ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" sets a new standard in teen movie queen bee degradation, if that is your idea of a turn on or a good time. Going any further with this sort of thing would cross into ""Carrie"" territory and that is an entirely different genre.Sabina's bad boy hunk Seth is played by sleepy looking Ryan Reynolds, he is relatively harmless and almost cluelessly disengaged. Reynolds would play an almost identical character three years later in ""Dick"". ""Dead Like Me's"" Daisy - Laura Harris - plays one of Katy's friends and has a lot of what the main actresses are missing.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",489,0,,0,No reference

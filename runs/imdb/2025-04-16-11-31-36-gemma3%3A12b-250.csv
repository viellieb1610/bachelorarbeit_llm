0,1893220,2009-12-05,Enchorde,地心冒險 (2008),5.0,"Recap: Unsuccessful and mainly disrespected geologist Trevor Anderson is obsessed with the idea that his disappeared brother put forth. That the tectonics works in such a way that another world might exist beneath ours, just like the story Jules Verne wrote. He is so obsessed he almost forgets that he is to take care of his nephew Josh a few days, so when the two of them find an anomaly on Iceland, he got to bring Josh along. He enlists young mountain guide Hannah, but on the expedition, they become trapped in a cave. It leads further and further down and soon they find themselves on the most unbelievable adventure.Comments: Yes, it is an adventure without any comparison, but two things should be known about this movie. First off, it is a family movie. Yes, it is adventurous, but not in any really suspenseful way. More in the goofy, funny way. You should know this before you watch, because otherwise it might become annoying.Second off, it was released in a 3D-version, and the script and direction is clearly adapted to it. It is all too evident, even if you don't get the 3D-version. Some stretches of the film is far too much alike a theme park ride to be really good. But I bet it is spectacular in 3D. Apparently the original writer and director left the production in fear of the movie focusing on effects more than story. His fears proved to be well founded as the story unfortunately takes the back seat to effects far too often. As a grown-up it almost gets boring sometimes, and I guess a few kids might think so too.Surprisingly much of the CGI is of pretty poor quality. Some animals and environment is feeling too much like plastic toys, and the characters are too evidently acting before a blue screen. Sure, I know they must be, but when it looks like they were cut in like in a movies from the forties, it's bad.I didn't much appreciate the acting either, with one exception. Mostly this is due to the characters. Trevor is too goofy and clumsy, and too responsible for the comic effect. Josh suffers from movie-kid syndrome annoyingly putting himself in trouble too much. Only Anita Briem, an authentic Icelandic, as Hannah is a competent character and acts convincingly. I sincerely hopes she get better roles in the future, and returns for the planned sequel.I had hoped for more, even without any high expectations. Maybe next time they could focus more on doing the basics, like a decent story, before they concentrate on the special effects.5/10",435,0,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

This film is a tad bit better than the previous two films due mostly to having a Western location, which adds a different touch to the typical murder mystery. Conway is more energized here and delivers a fine performance and even the supporting players are a step up from previous films with Cliff Clark stealing the show as the dimwitted but tough trying Detective.

Right.

Life is what happens while you're making plans and sometimes life throws a curve or two-and sometimes, life throws the baseball bat at your head. Such is the case here, in a short which starts with a morning straight out of Norman Rockwell that veers into Bosch all too quickly for the primary characters. Memorable, with images that will stick around for quite a while. I'll never see eggs, bacon or produce quite the same way again.

It actually turned out to be a good movie! I like the suspense and the horror mix along with it. I like how the story goes and the music was really cool and adds a whole lot to the composition of the movie. The actors were on top of their game and was great throughout the whole movie. The suspense kept my blood running really fast and my heart beat like crazy! The plot was amazingly unexpected. The dirty bad cops and their schemes made their investigation so believable and the way they take advantage of their job is mind-blowing. Also, the couples' house was really beautiful! The main characters were amazing in their role and they played it really well. And the antagonist was really great too! He also played the role really well. The setting was perfect for the movie. There were no times I got bored while watching Deadline. This movie proves that even with a low budget, a great movie can be produced.",189,0,,0,"No reference.

7,394462,2002-02-19,kinglevy,Jules and Jim (1962),6.0,"I'll warn you ahead of time, this is a bit of a spoiler.

Jules et Jim is one of the best examples of a New Wave love story. New Wave embodies the concept of a director working as an author would towards a great novel, the film is his work. Director Francois Truffaut's variety of great camera effects and subtle symbolism help to improve an otherwise bland screenplay.

The film about love and what it can do to friendships and personalities. It's a tale of three lovers set in France around World War I. Jules and Jim are best friends, Jim a Frenchman and Jules an Austrian. The pair does everything together, until they are separated by a woman named Catherine. Jules marries Catherine and buy a cottage in the country. While Jim lives his life in Paris, Jules and Catherine have a daughter and begin to raise her. The movie grows repetitive near the end, as Catherine betrays nearly every many she is with as her `love' jumps from person to person.

Following the concept of New Wave filmmaking, Truffaut truly is the auteur of the film. The screenplay, based on a novel by Henri Pierre Roché, is a basic French love story. Primarily based upon dialogue rather than actions, the story moves very slowly at times and very quickly at others. These sudden changes of pace done come without warning. There is an early scene with a Jim, Therese and Therese's steam engine trick, hinting that Jim may be spending quite a chunk of time riding on a train. Then there is the squeaky rocking chair in the cottage, representing the constant movement of Catherine and her desires. Perhaps the most memorable scene in the movie is Catherine's daring leap into a river. The scene is beautiful in terms of character development, explaining her seemingly crazy personality.

However, Truffaut's techniques are not without flaws. For example, the fate of Catherine and Jules's daughter Sabine is never explained. Sabine is a great refuge for Jim for a portion of the film, but scenes later she disappears. Near the end of the film when Catherine threatens to kill Jim, she gets a gun out of thin air. There are no gun shops around, no foreshadowing whatsoever. Perhaps this is simply Truffaut's idea of a surprise ending, but it really seems out of place from the rest of the film.

The film is quite a bit longer than it needed to be. Aside from the very end of the movie, the last hour or so grew extremely repetitive. Catherine's toying with her variety of lovers is way too extensive, almost pointless.; the men get hurt, then just keep coming back for more. This seems odd, considering earlier in the movie Catherine was described as a true woman rather than a perfect woman.

New Wave filmmaking is defined in Jules et Jim. It's described by most as poetic, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good. The creative direction makes the movie interesting at times, however the average screenplay makes it quite a boring two hours.",513,0,,0,"No reference.

8,2054968,2010-12-09,runamokprods,Le colonel Chabert (1994),8.0,"Wonderfully acted by Gerard Depardieu and Fanny Ardant, and beautifully shot.A man re-emerges 10 years after being declared dead in the Napoleonic wars. He wants something, but even HE doesn't seem sure what – his money his wife kept, and brought to her new marriage? Revenge on her for forgetting him? To win her back? Meanwhile, her own lawyer also takes on Chabert's side of the case, trying to broker a compromise, before word leaks out and all involved are ruined in scandal. (Fabrice Luchini is great as the lawyer who's motives are always a little mysterious). An interesting, subtle study of what's really of value in life. My only complaint is that some of the Machiavellian machinations are a little obviously played by both Ardant's character and her greedy, wormy new husband, who values a peerage over marriage, love or family. Somehow that artifice makes the film a bit less emotionally powerful than it might be. But I'd certainly see it again.",163,0,,0,"No reference.

It doesn't take much time to figure out that Timothy Treadwell was an unstable personality. There was even a personal crisis mentioned, after which he found a purpose in life in living among bears. Nevertheless, i felt a heartache when watching him talking to them or explaining to the schoolchildren how meek they actually are.We may also assume that he simply had a different outlook on life. But even then you must grow up in Disneyland in order to believe that grizzly bears are man's friends.

Mangal Pandey - who? In short its just an instance of kartoos & its attached melodrama coupled with songs & mangal pandey fighting for it. The rising almost looks like a short story/chapter from a history book than an epic. One would expect more from Amir & a 4 yr production work (not to mention 1 yr post production). Songs were unnecessary & the dialogues were uninspirational too. (imagine mangal pandey shouting all to 'raise' for a war by saying ""chalo chalo"" )But yeah, Amir did an honest job & so did Toby but then history should have more drama & war & bloody gore to show an impact as powerful as it should have been.

21,800058,2004-07-16,livewire-6,King Arthur (2004),,"I was really looking forward to seeing ""King Arthur"". I knew it would be different from the usual treatments of the legend, since it takes place in the fifth century, whereas the Camelot we have come to know and love is rooted in the fifteen century, ""when knighthood was in flower"". I figured ""King Arthur"" would be fresh, interesting and exciting. And it was ... almost.The director and screenwriter hedged their bets a little. Although the main character's real name is Lucius Artorius Castus (played by Clive Owen), he is referred to as Arthur. Guinevere and Lancelot are along for the ride, of course. Gawain and Galahad, too. Even the Round Table is thrown in for good measure. The problem is, only Arthur seems to have any real personality, any conflict or angst. Everybody else just gets swept up and along in his drama.And it's not even a personal, intimate drama. Gone is the tense love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot. What we get in its place is drama of a far more cerebral kind -- more philosophical than emotional. What motivates Arthur and his ""knights""? Longing for a home they have not seen for 15 years ... loyalty to an empire that no longer exists ... and, of all things, belief in the teachings of a heretic (Pelagius). The Rome Arthur fights is not that of the Caesars, but of the Church.I might have been more interested if the film had delved more deeply into the Pelagian heresy, but it only scratches the surface. As a result, I must confess I dozed off several times and missed several (perhaps crucial) scenes. On the whole, I felt I had wasted my time and money.I came hoping for ""one brief shining moment"".

The film had potential to be at least mediocre, but it just didn't work. The film was based around a weak, predictable plot that was filled with glaring plot-holes, and the characters and relationships were too underdeveloped to even make the film a character-driven story. Characters wander in and out of the plot without ever gathering much sympathy or hatred from audiences, and eventually it becomes difficult to care what happens to any of them. Even their dialogue is pitiful: swearing is fine in movies, but this film goes beyond overkill with its ridiculous amount of profanity, even to the point where it becomes distracting. Rather than encouraging viewers to listen for meaning in the characters' words, this film's dialogue quickly becomes a game of seeing just how many variations of the ""F word"" can be jammed into a single sentence.

It has some sort of bizarre attempt at a musical motive, but it is annoyingly repetitive and changes little from scene to scene.

St. Mark's church figures prominently in these scenes as well.This opening sequence gives pause to those who like to think of the 1950s as a less violent time than our own.Although none of the businesses shown on this episode are still there, the buildings mercifully haven't changed very much at all.

Nair either does not understand the book on which the film was based or has no respect for the author, Thackeray. A 750 page book is condensed into a 137 minutes film, and thus a major plot point occurs about every two minutes. Reese Witherspoon's Becky Sharp is a woefully unrealized character, portraying about as much depth as one would encounter in a high school play. In trying to make Sharp sympathetic, the entire point of the book is lost ( the self-serving vanity of all characters from all walks of life, including Becky Sharp). The attempts by Nair to re-interpret Thackeray from a postcolonial viewpoint are laughably half-baked, including a poorly executed pseudo Bollywood dance sequence which occurs nearly two hours into the film and has no relation to anything else that comes before. An Indian historian I talked to found Nair's view of India quite orientalist, as the director exoticizes the culture she's supposed to be championing.On the positive side there are many fine character actors on display, who for the most part are not given anything interesting to do.

            I first heard about this film when it sprung out of nowhere into Jonathon Ross's 'Best Film of the Year' event at number 5. He used the words 'low-budget', and only one scene was shown, and a very badly chosen one at that. (The cafeteria scene with the brilliant Carrie-Ann-Moss) It didn't catch my attention much for these two reasons, hence it was bad marketing.            I then forgot almost instantly about it, until it then, about 6 months later it popped into the IMDB at number 12. (No mean feat when you look what it's up against!) I then saw a better trailer for it, where it showed parts of the first 'reverse scene', where the gun flies backwards into Guy Pearce's hand, and instantly wanted to see it.            I had heard that the film had gotten a limited release, and being out here in Germany, with an equally limited variety of new films, I thought I wouldn't see it for ages. The next day I noticed that my local rental store was closing down, and at my lunch break, went over there to see what was selling. Hiding in a corner towards the back, was Memento. For 20 Deutsche Mark's ! (6 pounds, 10 dollars) Of course I rushed home to grab some money, and came late back to work, but hey, once you've seen the film, and understand my position, it was worth coming late for.
            I watched it once, and was impressed with its originality, and at how clever the middle scenes were, but was somewhat dazed about the end. Only now, after a second viewing, can I say that I understood it all. I know who was good and bad, and who strayed into both categories. Only real brainboxes with IQ's higher than the length of this film would understand it all the first time. Many people will claim to have understood it as they casually walk out of the cinema, but 80% of them will be lying.             I think the point I am trying to get at, is that this is a 'MUST see twice within a month film', for the ultimate viewing pleasure.             Every scene begins a mystery, but then once it has backtracked to familiar ground there is a very strange feeling of satisfaction.
            This certainly deserves to be at number one of any top 10 list, see it now, and if you already have, you probably haven't understood it, so see it again.AND THIS ISN'T FOR ANYBODY WITH SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS THEMSELVES !",426,0,bezieht sich nicht auf bewertungen,1,"Reference to other reviews.

36,1955225,2010-04-19,eucalyptus9,The Lovely Bones (2009),9.0,"I'd heard the acclaim for the novel ""The Lovely Bones"" so got a hold of the book and found the first few chapters interesting and original. Before long, though, it descended into a tedious, boring narrative that eventually had me turning to the end of the book, to find one of the lamest endings to a story I'd encountered.Somehow, out of this tedium Peter Jackson has fashioned a fascinating and beautiful film. The beauty seems to come from his own visionary qualities - many of the scenes of the after life hark back to the imaginative settings he created for his early feature ""Heavenly Creatures'. He's removed some of the novel's subplots - the changing dynamics of the Salmon family with their community, and the affair between Len and Abigail, although the latter gets the merest hint, when Jack is thanking Len for his friendship, and adds, meaningfully ""And thanks for being such a good friend to Abigail."" Subtle. The film had a PG-13 rating in the US and so the rape of Susie is glossed over, but the way that Jackson conveys the horror of her murder, without melodrama and explicitness, is remarkably well done.The cast are universally good. Mark Wahlberg, who was the best thing about ""The Departed"", seems to have since embarked upon a series of shonky performances in atrociously bad films, but in this, he is again excellent. Susan Sarandon has an hilariously funny scene, and Saoirse Ronan is brilliant. She's not a classic screen beauty, but when her erstwhile boyfriend Ray says to her ""You are beautiful, Susie Salmon"", you can't help but agree. I guess that Stanloy Tucci gets the major kudos. He's unrecognisable at first, and his sinister predator is as much a landmark villain as Anthony Hopkins made of Hannibal Lecter.Like Mel Gibson, Jackson's hand as director is evident in all his films. His major flaw is a tendency to go on too damn long - The Return of the King, King Kong - and I thought this movie was heading in the same direction, but he's restrained himself here. Jackson has created a good body of work - Meet The Feebles is always worth another look - but I think that this is his finest film. 9/10",376,0,,0,"No reference.

They pass the time casually, not much happens. End of first half. They take some kind of drug (I assume to be acid,) they share the surreal nightmare trip. Something bad happens, one of them will not be going home, ever, they react to it in varying ways.I couldn't help but enjoy the movie, they looked like they enjoyed themselves making it and that sense of fun comes across when watching. The dialogue is so real as we are treated to awkward conversations between people who have not much in common except shared college experiences and wonderfully natural lines such as ""oh my god, I bought wigs,"" ""fantastic, tell me more,"" ""they're blonde"" which made me giggle at the audacity of the film maker. The uncomfortable silences between the girls are even more realistic and true, it is these gaps in dialogue that accentuate what the movie is; a fun yet uncomfortable film about people and the way they relate to each other.The cinematography from Daryl Pitman is superb, not just for a low budget film but for a film full stop, he uses vivid colours, a locked camera and a clean crisp use of light to highlight the overall feel of fresh playfulness and a tension that's slow to build to barely a simmer.The music and sound design has gotten a lot of play, and rightly so, it is sufficiently hip when required and noticeably helps add to the sense of impending dread after one of the girls remarks that ""things are only going to get worse."" Whilst the idea of four lesbian/bi-sexual girls drinking and having fun would ordinarily play in to male fantasies without even trying, I left Vacation! massively impressed with Zach Clark's direction and his restraint. The film studies concept of the camera gaze as male is largely thrown out of the window here as at no point did I get the sense that any of the proceedings were being eroticised, or the characters shown in an overtly sexual manner. Even the brief nudity and sexual behaviour is filmed so matter of factly that claims of misogyny would be flimsy at best.Overall this is no Gregg Arraki, there's less plot, but it is a fun and impressive piece of low budget independent non-genre film making worth watching. blahblahblahgay.blogspot",408,0,,0,"No reference.

Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress but her screaming had to make me want to get ear plugs after one too many screams made me want to hit myself with a pillow.But despite what I wrote in my last paragraph, I'm still recommending this movie as a thriller where the special effects along with the tension music from John Williams (a Spielberg regular) doesn't make this film so bad to watch.Not the best alien flick I've ever seen, but it's entertainment.",425,0,,0,"No reference.

Because it is British rather than American, it is not stuffed full of artificial and mawkish sentimentality, but is more effective for being 'straight up'. The central role is played by an excellent child actor named Matthew Beard (born 1989), who since then has appeared in many films and TV series, most recently playing Guy Bellingfield in the rather notorious recent film THE RIOT CLUB (2014), which parodies the Bullingdon Club at Oxford. The young girl who plays opposite Beard is played by Charlotte Wakefield (born 1990), who is also excellent. Since then she has appeared in four TV series. Angeline Ball does an excellent job of playing the highly nervy and objectionable mother of Beard and does some really good hysterical scenes. (Let's hope she does not take her work home with her.) Sturdy Tom Wilkinson is there, like an English oak, supporting the whole effort with his unflappable demeanour as a farmer who is the adoptive father of the girl. Anna Massey plays 'Rosie' and gives a marvellous professional polish to the proceedings, as she did to everything. Of all the actresses I have known, she was certainly one of the nicest and most intelligent. She was married to a delightful, gentle scientist named Uri Andres (who once astounded me by handing me a chunk of kimberlite containing diamonds), having earlier somehow survived marriage to Jeremy Brett, which was evidently not easy. (She also had sadly unsatisfactory relationships with her father and her brother, the actors Raymond Massey and Daniel Massey, so you could say she had a rough time with the male gender for much of her life.) She was a truly fascinating woman. The well-known character actress Dora Bryan has a bit part in this film, and it is a shame we see so little of her. Willard Carroll has done a very good job of directing this film. The story is a 'slip through time' one, where the little boy of today goes back to the days of World War Two and then returns much wiser. It is quite an adventure, and children will love it.

51,1578399,2008-01-26,HelloTexas11,Patton (1970),10.0,"Patton' is pretty much a one-man show. George C. Scott's Oscar-winning portrayal dominates the film and overshadows all the other characters, much as Patton dominated those under his command in real life. There is no real attempt to create another strong character in the movie; Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is mainly used to react to Patton and the British General Montgomery is seen as a caricature, a stereotypical stuffy Brit who contrasts with Patton's earthy and impulsive nature. Scott truly becomes Patton in this film; it's difficult now to think of one without the other. The characterization and the film have many layers. On the one hand, 'Patton' is a straightforward war flick, with big, well-staged battle sequences. But it is also a brooding psychological study of a complicated individual, one who's near-madness goes hand in hand with his cunning and courage. Patton comes across as, among many things, an outsider in his own chosen field of endeavor. The other officers, including the generals who are his superiors, consider him something of a brilliant kook, to be used when needed and shunted aside when he isn't, or when he embarrasses them. Eisenhower, who is never seen or heard in the film, and his group of generals are businesslike, no-nonsense types who share none of Patton's flamboyance or showmanship. To them, the war is an ugly business to be concluded as quickly and painlessly as possible. For Patton, it is a holy, glorious crusade that defines him and his reason for being. Some critics claimed the movie was both pro-war and anti-war. I have to agree with Roger Ebert, it's no such thing; it's about as pro-war as you can get. But since its setting is World War II, that is not a difficult or far-fetched notion to accept. Even in this confused day and age where we agonize over whether conflicts are worth getting involved in, most people agree that the U.S. was on the right side in the second world war and that vanquishing Hitler and the Nazis was the right thing to do. Patton embodies that ideal and so we naturally root for him even if some of his actions and statements go against what we would do. George C. Scott so inhabits the character of Patton that it almost becomes irrelevant whether the portrayal is one-hundred per cent accurate. As war historians have pointed out, liberties are taken both with dialogue and plot points; there was no 'race' for Messina between Montgomery and Patton, there were actually two soldiers who were slapped, etc. But these easily fall into the realm of cinematic license and do nothing to detract from the essential reality Scott brings to his characterization. And it certainly says something about General Patton that the famous speech he gave in 1944 had to be toned down for a movie that was released in 1970!",479,0,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Yes, it left a lot to be desired - a better ending for one - but it was interesting, somewhat thought provoking and the characters were very entertaining.  I loved Jennifer Tilly's character and her various ""tantrum"" scenes.  Daryl Hannah's character was pathetic and annoying, but at least she was consistent in the way that she created the character.  What I was most disappointed in  is that actresses are constantly complaining about having to play girlfriends, bimbos and other stereotypes, yet when they have an opportunity to create a character in an workshop/ensemble piece they decide on strippers.  Seems like a bit of a cop-out to me ""at least if the movie is no good, they'll watch for the stripping.""

54,4512477,2019-11-08,skunkworksalpha,Midway (2019),10.0,"Midway was an excellent movie that depicts the events leading up to the battle of Midway and the battle itself.
It is fairly quick paced with enough historical background character introductions to leave the viewer invested, even if we already know the outcome. The family and buddy scenes are not lengthy, and add just the right amount of the human element.
The movie covers the events from before Pearl Harbor, the attack on pearl Harbor, the US raid on the Marianas islands, Doolittle's raid, the battle of Coral Sea, the battle of Midway and the intelligence, strategy, of both the US and IJN navies. Though none of the events is overly detailed it is enough for the average historian to see all the ""easter eggs"" and the non-historian left informed and intrested.
While the movie covers a lot of historical ground it doesn't get overly detailed on each event, even the Midway battle itself. What it does do is provides the viewer the overall tension, concerns and apprehensions of the mood of he US durring this time in history.
Midway does leave out certain historical events. It didn't cover the PBYs search, the B-17 raids on the IJN carriers, it didn't include Jimmy Thatch, or the two attacks on the Yorktown in detail.
But, and I must stress this fact, what it did cover was accurate (with the exception of the US torpedo planes carrying bombs on wing hard mounts).
For the first time in a movie it covers the air raids on the IJN carriers from Midway itself, including thr B-26 Marauders, but not the TBF avengers. It included the Nautilus Gato class firing on the IJN taskforce and the reason the Japanese left behind the destroyer which was later followed by the US SBDs that led them to the IJN carries.
The CGI was adequate for visual effects, and the detail of the Yorktown class carriers and even the IJN carriers was incredibly accurate.
Midway focuses on several key individuals to be the protagonist rather than a PBS style docudrama.
Midway also pays attention to detail about the age of the sailors, the types of aircraft, and weaponry aboard ships.
Midway does feel like it needs the director's cut and would do better as a three hour movie as it felt a little rushed at times.

The script and direction are coherent, and the viewer can certainly identify with the main character as another poor schmoe who's been run over by life, with no way out. In a way, it elicits a positive reaction because Rulo, the fiftyish and overweight protagonist, never seems to lose spirit as he suffers one telling blow after another.As with many other recent films coming out of post-fascist South America, it is moreover revealing of the intense personal struggles these basically European people have faced as time continues to run against them in terms of their general redundancy within the context of a world economy.In a word, sad.

61,4090558,2019-03-30,MidnightSerpent,Tengen toppa gurren lagann (2007–2008),10.0,"You know that feeling of total shock and awe that you get after finishing a really good show or movie? Where you just sit there staring at the screen, unable to process the sheer epicness of what you just saw? Imagine that feeling, but ten times stronger, and you might get a taste of what I felt while watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Every time I finish that final episode, I get this euphoric feeling that lasts for several hours on end, often keeping me up the entire night on pure adrenaline. There isn't a single day that goes by where I don't have flashbacks to certain scenes from the show and start getting the chills all over again. Yes, it's that good.One of the most common misconceptions of Gurren Lagann I hear is that it's a simple, mindless show that's all about over the top fight scenes and cheesy inspirational speeches. And while the show has plenty of those, it has way more than just adrenaline rushes to offer. The story is very well written, following several intertwined character arcs and thematic ideas that all spiral around a very deep and thought provoking central message. The attention to detail is ridiculous, with extended metaphors that can be applied to almost every aspect of the show. On top of that, there are several plot twists and surprises to keep the viewer engaged. The only issue I might have with the story is with a couple episodes near the beginning, which I feel are weaker than the rest of the show, but the last few episodes more than make up for it with my favorite ending of all time.The major characters of this show are brilliantly written. Kamina's bold relentless attitude has its own charm, and Simon ""the Digger"" has one of the best character arcs I've seen in any form of media. Other characters like Yoko, Viral, Rossiu, and Lordgenome all have their own traits and well written arcs throughout the series. While their world is very different from ours, the characters feel very real and relatable through their growth. And of course, the villains are also great, with justified and believable motivations that serve as a near perfect contrast to our protagonists.The visuals are animation are outstanding in this show, especially when considering that it was made in 2007. The fights are beautifully choreographed and visually appealing with vivid color palettes. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in anime. And there's plenty of visual symbolism that adds meaning to the story and characters. The art is especially good in the final few episodes, which the creators saved 40% of their budget for. And it shows; those final episodes are some of the most beautiful episodes I've ever seen. That final fight, oh my god.The show is just as amazing in the audio department. The voice acting is powerful for both the sub and dub versions. In fact, it has one of the best dubs I've heard, right alongside Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. But where the sound truly stands out is in the music. There's a large variety of soundtracks that perfectly capture every scene, whether they're happy, sad, spine-chilling, or pure hype moments. One track in particular, titled ""Libera Me From Hell"", is the most unique and symbolic soundtrack I've ever heard. It plays during some of the best scenes in the entire show, and it makes those scenes that much better.Yeah, as you can probably tell by now, I love this show. It's my favorite piece of fiction across all types of media and storytelling, and I've had more fun watching it than anything else. Hell, those last few episodes are probably in the top ten best experiences of my life. The show's messages have genuinely made a positive impact on my life and how I view the world. And while I don't expect everyone to enjoy it as much as I do, I think anyone would be doing themselves a huge favor by watching it. So what are you waiting for?

Anyone who wants a reasonably decent explanation in coherent terms ought to consult the Film Guide series from Indiana University Press.It is an unforgettable movie that would not have had quite the same impact if it had been made more than one or two years, one way or the other, of 1968.Just take one instance. The computer, Hal, the most interesting character in the film, goes berserk. He signals to the two astronauts that there is a failure that must be fixed from the outside. The astronauts leave the space ship in tiny round pods. While they are gone, Hal kills all the other astronauts who are in hibernation for the long trip to Jupiter. Hal also causes a pod to kill one of the external astronauts and then refuses entry to the remaining live one, Dave (Keir Dullea).Dullea orders repeatedly, ""Open the pod bay doors, Hal."" His expression is one of vexation, as if he's having a duel of wits with a recalcitrant garage door. Finally he blasts his way into the space ship, barely surviving, then sets about destroying Hal. As he climbs a ladder to enter Hal's brain, Hal remarks soothingly, ""Dave -- I can see your really upset about this."" It's EXACTLY what Carl Rogers would have said. Hal begins to sound like a junior executive being fired. ""I know I've made some bad decisions recently. But I can assure you that I am back to normal now. Really, I am devoted to the success of this mission"" If that's supposed to be a joke, it must have worked in 1968, when we were all in the business of seeing (or being) humanistic shrinks. I'm not sure that everybody would find the humor in such a line now, in 2005, a year in which most of the USA seems to find itself adrift on Jupiter. In the end, Dullea, if that in fact is what we're looking at, finds himself alone and unborn in the shrill silence of outer space.That ""star gate"" episode -- wow! The coeval audience had a heck of a good time seeing it while stoned. Vavoom -- through an unknown universe! Into the Maelstrom. It must have been great if you'd been smoking grass. If you were tripping it might have become one of Edgar Allan Poe's worst hangovers. Just seeing it tonight took me back thirty years or so to when I was a research assistant at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute, engaged in a study of psychedelic drug use. It was perfectly legitimate, run by the psychiatrist who coined the term ""psychedelic"" and visited Aldous Huxley on his death bed, and endorsed by a former Attorney General of the United States. (By the way, has the statute of limitations run out?) We were not supposed to use drugs but one night circumstances demanded it and the next thing I knew I was wandering around a part of Manhattan I was completely unfamiliar with, the East 70s, never having gotten north of 14th Street in my youth. And -- wow -- everything was just terrible. People were walking dogs along the sidewalks and I fancied the dogs were staring at me because they knew I was a complete wreck. Well, let's skip it, except to say that what you need in a paranoid state is not the trip that Kubrick gives you, but a handle on reality. Well, I'm not sure, really. Sometimes I feel spaced out here in New Mexico where the Ice Cream trucks play ""La Cucaracha."" In the New Jersey neighborhood where I grew up they at least had the prescience to play the ""Dies Irae.""Anyway, one of the most impressive features of the film is the special effects -- all done in the 1960s before computers. They are all mechanical or photographic. No computerized graphic images like the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" or the musclebound monsters that leap around on today's screen. If you see a space ship in ""2001"", it was hand built. The FX are the pinnacle of pre-computerized FX. They're like the clipper ships of the 1850s, marvels of marine engineering, about as good as it gets, before they were replaced by steamships.I realize this is not much of a review of the movie itself, but without having looked, I imagine there must be a hundred or more so, really, why bother? Kubrick was an interesting guy. According to Kirk Douglas's revealing (and not very flattering) autobiography, ""Rag Man's Son,"" Kubrick shot ""Spartacus"" which had been written by someone on the McCarthy-style blacklist and forbidden to work in the USA. A heated discussion arose about who exactly should get the writing credit, since the actual writer's name couldn't be used. How could justice best be served. Kubrick piped up and said if you want a writer's name, use mine. I'll take the credit. As Douglas put it, ""Kubrick was a talented s***.""But -- all of that period and personal detail aside -- this film is a magnificent artifact.

Masatoshi Nagase is suitably brooding and mysterious as the weary manager of the stall, tolerant if not indulgent of the inane chatter of schoolgirls who occupy his workplace like a clubhouse. Kirin Kiki is her usual charismatic and maverick self, managing to bring humanity and pathos to a role that could easily have been cloying and maudlin. The storyline of the older women bringing hope to a man with a crushing past works well, Tokue proving a catalyst to stop the manager going through the motions and start living again. The film also functions as an educational piece on the discrimination historically meted out to sufferers of Hansen's disease, or leprosy, in Japan. This part is less effective, following the well-worn trope of having a schoolkid come along so the adults can relate the hidden history she knows nothing about. Heavy-handed and flat, it ill-serves the narrative, and slightly trivializes an ugly but fascinating aspect of Japan's social history.Kawase does not totally leave behind her shamanistic/animistic leanings: there are the usual hand-held shots of sunlight glinting through treetops, and some cod-philosophy on the power of the moon. She hones excellent performances from Kirin and especially Nagase, whose edges seem all too brittle and authentic. A small film with a big heart, that makes a quiet but powerful point.",287,0,,0,"No reference.  The review solely describes the movie's plot, acting, and thematic elements.

This film is so gross that not even myself, a huge horror fan could not even cope with, and I have seen all eight Saw films. Terrifier truly lives up to its name and the clown is genuine creepy but the thing that this film is missing is a perfect story line and less disturbing gory scenes. This film released in 2017 was picked up by Netflix a year later to hoping to traumatise its audience like the film ""IT"". However this clown film surprisingly had me running.....for the toilet. I have seen many gore films but this one tops my list, literally. You don't get as much gore in a regular movie due to MPAA concerns but this film goes way beyond. Avoid this movie if you have a very uneasy stomach.Anyways the film Terrifier takes the story of an evil and very creepy looking clown named Art who then sees some new victims and begins terrorising and torturing the poor souls. By torturing I don't mean stretching or dunking or tickling a persons feet in the stocks, I mean literal bloody torture. What I thought about this film was that it just all over the place. There were too many scenes which I thought were pointless and did not really have me paying attention to the whole plot line. Even though there were some scares and tricks up their sleeve I just think that it was not as good as the director hoped. Terrifier is truly a one of a kind film that is perfect for the people that love a good ol clown horror film and especially for those with strong stomachs and their love to see a bunch of blood and guts coming out of a person. But if the film was more properly taken seriously and given it a better story line then this film would have been perhaps one of the greatest clown films every made.

This movie was not great, let's not beat around the bush.I sat down to watch ""You're Not Alone"" from writer Andrew Wong and director Eduardo Rodriguez because the movie was labeled as a horror movie, and also because the cover/poster for the movie was actually interesting.Well, turns out that this was more of a thriller than it was a horror movie, so I was somewhat disillusioned with the movie and I felt bereft of a horror experience. I can see that IMDb also has the movie labeled as a thriller and a mystery.The storyline told in ""You're Not Alone"" was just rubbish in my opinion. Writer Andrew Wong brought nothing new to the cinema with this 2020 movie. In fact, everything that transpired in this movie had been seen before in other similar movies, so it made for a very stale movie experience, especially since the other - and older - movies fared better than this 2020 movie did.The acting in the movie was adequate. Well, it was not great, but nor were it all that bad. But taking into consideration the limitation imposed by the lack of a proper script and storyline, then I think the actors and actresses were doing adequately enough. The characters, however, well don't get your hopes up here, because they were bland, uninteresting and just too generic.In fact, as the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of 'was that really it?'. So, I can't really claim to be impressed nor overly entertained by ""You're Not Alone"".My rating of this 2020 thriller lands on a mere three out of ten stars.

Bond leaving the performance to try to assist a defector and stop an apparent KGB sniper. A kick ass fight between Green-4 and Necros (superbly played by Andreas Wisniewski, who has a most memorable, and rather funny, death scene) ; probably the sweetest Bond girl ever, Kara Milovy (played by Maryam d'Abo) My favourite aspect of this is that Timothy Dalton's Bond was a chameleon, who could pull off a number of different guises. Here, Dalton's Bond begins in paratrooper gear, and Dalton looks believable in it. Next, we see Dalton's Bond in a tuxedo at a concert hall during a recital, and Dalton looks believable in a tux. After walking to the apartment across the street from the concert hall, he closes up his jacket to conceal his white shirt, adds a pair of black gloves, and he's now in sniper gear. Dalton not only pulls off all of those appearances, but he also makes the transition from one to the next look believable. Dalton has Bond dressed casually, in a turtleneck and black leather jacket, and he looks believable in that. Toward the end of the film, Bond is in a jellaba and a turban in Afghanistan, and Dalton looks believable in that also, where a lot of others might just look silly. I cannot think of any other actor could have pulled off that many changes in one film and have it look believable. Dalton's Bond could walk into a room and blend in, whereas someone like Connery (who, if anything, was too charismatic) stand out, and will be noticed and remembered.He understood that Ian Fleming's literary character was not suave and debonair, nor was he witty and humorous. The character created by Fleming was not ""larger than life"", he could blend in to his surroundings. He was an antihero, not a suave superspy like some of Connery's films, and most of Moore films presented him. Beautifully photography in Gibraltar, (the former) Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Morocco; it also has a great theme song, which is worked into the film's primary score perfectly.Only a bit too much humour on the part of the villains (they should have been tough as nails when behind closed doors) and a slightly long run time work against this one. But it is still one of my favourite Bond films, my favourite actor is in lead, as well as being the first Bond I ever saw.",420,0,,0,"No reference.

This movie was announced as one of the best and funniest movies Jackie Chan had ever made. I truly hope for him that this isn't true, because this movie really was a big disappointment.I never felt like laughing while watching this movie. The only time that I had a smile on my face was with the bloopers at the end of the movie. So I don't think the title 'Comedy' is well chosen. This isn't more than an action / martial arts movie with a lot of fight scenes (too many if you ask me), an awful story, an obvious plot, bad acting and even worse dialogs. Even the style of filming wasn't to my taste... I don't like the semi-flashy, pop video-way of filming which was used from time to time to make this movie seem so much more spectacular than it really is.So far for the bad critics, what I do like about this movie is the fact that Jackie Chan did his stunts himself. All my respect for that. There aren't many actors who dare to do so, but he doesn't seem to mind a little bit of pain. The only other good thing that I can say about it is about the actresses... good choice. They don't contribute to the story, but at least they look great.I guess this is a movie that will be loved by children and all the fans of Bruce Lee and other martial arts masters.

85,1370695,2007-01-08,Jay_Exiomo,Blood Diamond (2006),7.0,"If anything, Edward Zwick's latest film ""Blood Diamond"" - yet another commentary on African turmoil, this time focusing on conflict diamonds - presents brutal facts that can make one examine his position regarding consumerism. However, Zwick and screenwriter Charles Leavitt overstate the matter by focusing on too many perspectives and the result is an unfocused narrative with a runtime that feels too long for something that could have used a few minutes less.

Set in 1999, when the Sierra Leone government was in a civil war against the insurgent Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is arrested for smuggling conflict diamonds out of the war-stricken country. Faced with the problem of having to repay Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) - the South African mercenary supposed to receive said diamonds - Archer, a white former soldier from Southern Africa (Rhodesia, particularly) finds a desperate hope in Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who he believes has found and secretly buried a hundred-karat diamond deep in the forests. Archer then enlists Vandy's help, along with Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) - an American magazine writer - in acquiring the diamond in exchange for helping the latter find his family earlier separated from him during an RUF raid in their village.

No stranger to movies tackling international conflicts, Zwick succeeds in portraying the brute exploitation of the war-torn country's citizens with graphic shots of sadist chaos reverberating throughout. While it does get a little too patronizing, the film's ambivalence towards the course it should take is its greatest fault. As such, there are times the gunfights and explosions nearly get the better of a script that otherwise feels like a standard action thriller.

Fortunately, some of the featured performances give good enough reasons for one to root for the film's characters. DiCaprio, a lock for various acting awards this season, provides nuance and credibility to his character with another solidly gritty performance. Hounsou in turn manages to garner sympathy for what could have been an archetypal role. On the other hand, Connelly doesn't generate interest as her character is barely defined and her presence is mostly inconsistent.

""Blood Diamond"" is ultimately a fairly solid film. Despite its flaws, the film has the ability to provoke anyone with the brutal nature of its theme.

The perspective on right and wrong is a main theme throughout the film and questions every character's outlooks and morals, even among the ""good guys"". Or more to the point, whether there is, or is not, in fact, a time to kill.Not only does it ask this to the characters in the film, but it asks it to you, the viewer. It makes you ask yourself where you stand. The film raises many important issues in society, and not just among racism, but justice for that matter, and what is right and wrong, both morally and ethically. Of course though, even with all this said, the film is not unbiased. Working off the basis of most movies, there is a definitive ""good"" and ""bad"" and you know who you're cheering on and who you're not, or at least, who the writer's are and are not. Sometimes this can come across as a little simple-minded, maybe even arrogant, but the film tries its hardest to bring a point from every side. Opinions still rage among characters who are meant to be working with each other, showing the different thought process of individuals.Many see this film as heavily biased, but I can guarantee there are many respectable points brought forward by all the characters, even the ""bad guys"", that will challenge everyone. The white aren't all just black hating hicks and the black aren't all just innocent victims of racism who never inflict any themselves.Moving away from the social aspect of this film, A Time to Kill offers much in the way of acting and writing. Although I usually find Matthew McConaughey uninspiring, his performance as Jake is the best I've ever seen him hold. Jackson is superb and refreshing in a much different role than that of what he seems to be playing recently. Alongside these great performances is Sandra Bullock as aspiring lawyer, Ellen Roark, and Kevin Spacey as ""big bad wolf"" District Attorney Rufus Buckley. A Time to Kill is a work that evidences the best all these actors have to offer, or at least, did have to offer once upon a time. It shows of a better time before such actors fell into forgettable flicks such as ""Fool's Gold"" and ""21"".At the end of it all, A Time to Kill is going to conflict with many viewer's personal opinions. Not everyone is going to agree with it's outtake on what is good and bad. But you can at least give it credit for daring to raise the question and making you decide where you stand. This coupled with top-notch acting makes A Time to Kill well worth the watch.Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamignjapanproductions",482,0,,0,"No reference.

There was a mountain of wit, tons of excitement, laced with drama, bromance and well, well, well, some romance too from the most surprising of quarters. I love the way BBC has juxtaposed Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century, taken inspiration from his books and giving it a modern twist to come up with something that is extraordinary fun to say the least. Scandal in Belgravia picks up from the original Scandal in Bohemia, which itself being an average story holds significance because to its credit, it introduces Irene Adler, perhaps the only woman to whom Sherlock might have romantic allusions, and perhaps the only target that slipped out from Holmes- in his own words, the woman, the one that got away.So if Bohemia was about a royal blackmail plot involving some incriminating pictures, Belgravia goes a bit grander, with terrorists, CIA and some S&M being thrown in for good measure. Irene Adler is a high class dominatrix and when she comes to possess some compromising pictures of the royal family, Holmes is tasked to retrieve them. But then nothing is as simple as it looks, as Adler deftly uses her profound sexuality to befuddle Holmes, and at the same time protect herself. Lara Pulver's Adler is provocative, manipulative and supremely sexy, and she does what all the villains in the world have failed to do so far- throw Holmes off the track, by using the basest of human emotions- and yes, there is an occasional flicker of lust in our hero's eyes- he does show his human side.There is a continuous stream of humor running throughout, and much of it emanates from the banter between Holmes and Watson. And as the titular character, Benedict Cumberbatch is pure, greased lightning. He portrays Holmes like none other before, and none other will do ever after, perhaps. His version of Sherlock is snooty, not more different than an immensely talented yet petulant child, so much in need of flattery and adulation, ice cold veneer and immeasurable intellect. This guy does will never have to resort to physical action entertainment as Downey did a few weeks back, such a natural he is. Watch out for his nude sequence at Buckingham Palace, and when he deconstructs a crime scene at the bank of a river. Martin Freeman as Watson is solid, but a bit unassuming, sometimes we tend to forget he is around, such an overpowering presence Cumberbatch has as Sherlock. Every episode of Sherlock is a full fledged movie in itself, and the cinematography, technology and editing makes Sherlock outstanding- on screen texts, extreme close up shots of peoples clothes when Sherlock analyzes them gives an insight into how he makes his deductions- all these little touches add up for an enthralling finale. Sherlock the series proves that when it comes to British icons, its best left to the Brits to re-interpret them. An easy 10/10 and Steven Moffat, take a bow.

Director James Wan and friend thought up this idea and put it on paper and then put it to film in 18 days. Why can't the major part of Hollywood get it right? Anyways, this thriller is based on a somewhat serial killer who terrorizes his victims buy setting them up in some type of ""trap"" similar to ""Se7en"", but he leaves them with a small chance of survival, but with the cost of something. That's why I said a ""somewhat"" serial killer because he doesn't actually kill his victims, they mostly kill themselves. The main part of the film surrounds two victims who are chained up on the opposites sides of a bathroom and are given two hacksaws, and the hacksaws aren't meant for the chains. The one victims is given a slight advantage and has to escape and murder the other victim to save his family's lives. There are also various clues on how to get out, why they are there and a few side tracks to hide the true identity of the killer.

The film is very interesting at first, but starts to fade as the story develops as it's gets boring just watching these two guys just sit in this bathroom for an hour and a half. That is until the movie ends, which really makes the movie such a good movie. Since most good movies are sometimes soured by poor endings, this is just the opposite.

He takes another genuinely interesting premise and absolutely slaughters it on screen - and I'm not referring to the body count here.The opening ten minutes are admittedly great. Drew Barrymore reaching for the phone, only to find herself in conversation with a stalker is inspired. What a pity then about the rest of the film.Back in the mists of time when horror movies used to scare people - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, Psycho - Scream would probably have passed without notice. But since The Evil Dead, it seems you don't have to scare people anymore, you simply have to amuse them.Quite honestly, I don't care about Jason's mum, nor about Jason, nor about who was hiding behind the curtain with a machete in their hand and wearing a stocking over their head halfway through Prom Night III.The genre of horror lost its teeth some time ago.

If you want to see real true horror, watch Wolf Creek from about 2005.For those of a less demanding taste watch this drivel, masquerading as a horror film and stuffed full of characters straight out of any number of American sitcoms. Which brings me back to my earlier point: how does Wes Craven manage to slaughter so many genuinely good ideas?I recently saw his New Nightmare aka Nightmare On Elm Street Part 7, and it was virtually identical to Scream.

In the end, it is revealed that 95% of the movie was just Jacob's dying hallucinations, and he was still in Vietnam all along. If you have seen a movie with a twist ending before, then you should be able to figure this out pretty quickly. After this realization, the whole movie becomes a bunch of pointless scenes with no stakes. Another thing that is presented as a twist is that the Americans were killing each other instead of the Viet Cong, but the first question I asked when I watched the movie was ""Why are the Americans killing each other?"". We find out that is was because the military was testing them with a psychotropic drug. I suppose this is the one mystery in the movie that wasn't plainly obvious at the beginning, but it also wasn't that interesting when you realized that the whole search for answers was just part of his hallucination.

The first thing of his I saw was ""The Children"", which was excellent. However, being that he only supplied the story and did not write the screenplay or direct, his influence is hard to gauge.Next I saw ""Cherry Tree Lane"", which I do not particularly care for. I will admit that if you want a realistic story of a family being terrorized by teenagers, this is about the best job that could be done. But it is not my cup of tea, and did not leave me overly impressed.And so, I entered into ""The Cottage"" a little bit less than confident, and was immediately impressed. Williams has a phenomenal script here, seamlessly blending a crime drama, a comedy and a horror film without missing a beat. As the genres blend together or flow from one to another, it never seems forced or awkward. The success of this feat alone make the film worthwhile, as I am unable to think of any other picture that has even tried this blend.But beyond the script, the characters are excellently cast and acted (it is nice to see Andy Serkis in a human role). The special effects are well above average. The makeup is quite good.

The reason why the remake is so damned awful, is that Americans do not understand the subtlties of European humour, failing to realise that slap stick and obvious ploys to get women dressed in next to nothing do not work, nor does the ebonical slang that haunts many a film, spoken from stereotypical aggressive blacks. Anywho...I don't own many comedy films in the film collection, often the formula is repetitive, and certain films can only be endured a handful of times before coming tiresome, and placed in the back of ones collection to gather dust, to be left there until the time comes when DVD's are replaced by something else all together. Taxi, however, is a severely enjoyable romp, which I can find myself watching on a frequent basis as the film is just so damned entertaining.A Luc Besson script, but not directed by him, presents us with our two main characters, Daniel the greatest pizza delivery boy turned Taxi Driver, and Emilien the most bumbling police officer since Inspector Gadget. The humour is grand, and the difference between the two is highlighted from the very beginning. Daniel is the smooth charmer, from which the humour associated with him comes at the expense of those around him, whilst Emilien is the source of all the gags he provides due to his nature as a complete incompetent (this highlighted brilliantly in the scene where he is learning to drive). But do not let this fool you Emilien is a hard working honest man, and he is in no way handicapped, bar possibly his attempts of trying ""too"" hard.The humour is understated which truly makes this one of the greats. Everything is done so stylish and classily, there are no gigantic slapstick moments, or moments of humour based of vulgarities, the humour is exactly what humour should be, quick witted dialogue combined with precarious ""sit-com""-esque moments. The film charts the progress of these two characters as Daniel is entrapped by Emilien and ""forced"" to work for him, as Daniel and the officers he work with, engage in various plans e.g Operation Cougar in vein attempts to capture the ever elusive and so wonderfully stereotypical German Mercedes Gang (what's in a name!). So the chase is on, and using Daniels modified Peugeot they formulate a plan to trap the krauts (""damn the special franco-German relationship""). This is truly a must for any fan of cinema. On a random note, I noticed one IMDb critic commented on the futility of the ""joint-smoking"" scene with Emilien and Daniel. Obviously the lad is American as marijuana is heavily frowned upon there (but you can drive a death trap at 16), but it merely symbolises their close net relationship, and how friendship is more important to the both of them, as the police officer can over look it, and indulge in this treat with Daniel. This is a rip roaring comedy which will have you in stitches come its unexpected finale, it certainly is one of the greatest pay-offs in film history, and if you don't agree, well I guess you can just stick that in your pipe and smoke it then, can't you?!",551,1,eigentlich referenz ohne sentiment,1,"Reference to other reviews.

And despite the controversy, I thought I would end up disliking this movie like the Aaliyah or Whitney biopic. But this had substance, music, and felt organic. The only downfalls are 1) Zoe Saldana looks NOTHING like Nina Simone. There are rare instances in some scenes where I can see it-- But no matter how amazing of an actress Zoe Saldana is she is too thin, her skin color is shades different from how Nina's looked, and her face just a bit like a costume instead of a believable human being. It took away a significant amount of believability. This hurts me to say this, because again I love Zoe and Nina. 2) No matter how much substance this movie has, a lot of it becomes void, based on the fact that Nina's life centered around a dark black skinned woman and her struggles. Being dark skinned is a central part of Nina's being and story. It minimizes her journey to cast a light skinned actress who barely resembles her. I personally feel Whoopi Goldberg or Viola Davis would've been much more suited for this role. That would have created a much more believable on-screen illusion for me to get lost in as a viewer.

Overall. Flaws aside, this film does have a little bit of substance. It's not as bad as Lifetime's terrible attempt at the Aaliyah or Whitney movie-- but it isn't as good at 'What's Love Got to Do With It?' or 'Crazy Sexy Cool- the TLC Story'

The story features basic themes of love and revenge, with well-paced flash-backs to the origin of Wade Wilson as he becomes Deadpool, but is refreshingly unique and original. Both in and out of costume, the star provides laughs. Deadpool is no typical movie adaptation of a comic book character; it's nowhere near family-friendly like Spiderman or The Avengers. This one is R rated and intended for mature viewers who enjoy extremely immature comedy, in addition to over the top violence. It's not for kids, except the ones with 'cool parents' of course. Director, Tim Miller, strongly impresses in his first feature film. The CGI effects are well-utilized and Deadpool's signature style of breaking the fourth wall is a frequent treat. The plot and pacing provide a steady stream of fun. The film has its clichés like any, but makes fun of them to viewers as they occur, turning anything generic into a laugh. Be prepared for a vulgar, perverted and crude humor with over-the-top violence. If nudity or sex scenes offend you, then beware. The satirical humor can be dark and twisted similar to South Park at its most extreme. Not all the comedic dialog lands flush, but the creatively colorful dialog keeps the laughs coming. Ryan Reynolds feels perfectly cast as the quick-witted anti-hero. Ed Skrein stars as the antagonist/villain, Ajax. Although the character is a prototypical British baddie, his back and forth with Reynolds is great. Actor T.J. Miller provides comedic support as the best friend, Weasle. Morena Baccarin, who plays the role of Wilson's girlfriend, Vanessa, impresses in a silly, fun role in stark contrast to her work in Homeland. As Deadpool, he has another pair of supporting characters in the form of X-Men, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The former is played by Stefan Kapicic and Greg LaSalle, who split the work between voice and physical acting. The Latter, who I'll call NTW, is Brianna Hildebrand, who pulls it off well.

123,2391961,2012-12-20,lagudafuad,即刻救援 (I) (2008),8.0,"Taken is a cult classic with a huge following, and all this is due to its portrayal of a former CIA who was ready to do anything to get back his kidnapped daughter. The movie's intense following is due to its violent nature portrayed by Liam Neeson, as he was a James Bond, Jason Borne and Rambo all rolled up into one chasing down a group of Armenians and making them pay dearly for even thinking about taking his daughter.The film was so well received by audience that it raked in a high 200 million dollars from its 25 million dollars production cost, Luc Besson was the man behind the direction and the writing of this cult classic and he was called back to come make the sequel Taken 2, which was released in 2012.The movie is about Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), whose daughter gets kidnapped when she travels to Paris to follow U2 during their European tour. With only a picture of his daughter at the airport, the voice of the man who took her, Bryan is racing against time to save his daughter before she is shipped out of the country and not seen again.Liam Neeson's performance in this movie is what is captivating; his character's ability to keep calm and think his way through any situation is what makes Bryan Mills the wrong guy to mess with (elements of Jason Borne), he used every known way alive to track down these guys, even shooting a friend's wife just to get the man to talk. He placed himself in danger numerous times but was able to find a way out at all times making him Bond and Rambo.At the end of this movie, you will be queuing up for seconds. My favourite action scene is when Bryan corned Peter (the man who leads the kidnappers to his daughter) in a taxi in Paris and starts to punch his ribs in, giving him details of how his ribs and lungs may not survive another punch if Peter doesn't give him all the information he wants to know. Here is a DVD that i couldn't help but owning.Mind you Taken 2 was just same same, with him and wife taken now and he just having to be Bryan and he breaks free tracks down the guys again and messes them up. Taken 2 is just a speck in the dark compared to this grand master.www.lagsreviews.com",407,0,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Despite their really liking it, much of the film didn't seem to work for me and despite a few very nice scenes, the overall picture left me flat and a bit confused. Had the film been more of an outright comedy, I think it would have worked better for me. Instead, parts were comedic, parts were a bit dull and much of it was just inexplicable.The film is the story of a slacker who is in 9th grade and soon to take his high school exams. While we don't have these in the States, I know that in many countries this is a HUGE event--and Japanese families put a lot of pressure on their kids to get into the best schools. Despite this pressure, the kid chooses not to even try and is one of the worst kids in his class....and previous tutors were unable to get him to budge. This new one is odd...very odd. In fact, much of the time he seems to act for practically no reason and in ways you'd never expect. However, when the boy's father offers him a bonus for each ranking the kid improves, that's enough to get the odd tutor to act---occasionally slapping or threatening the boy to get results. Then, as if my magic, the boy improves (though how and this whole process seemed to come from no where) and instead of everything being wonderful, you see through the course of this film that the family is really screwed up--distant, dysfunctional and bland. So, again out the the blue, the tutor beats the snot out of all of them and leaves. Then, the mom and two sons are shown becoming sleepy and taking a nap...and so the film ends.As I said, the film has some wonderful moments--but too much of the stuff in between looks like outtakes or scenes that should have been deleted. I just kept hoping the film would get really weird or profound...but nothing. Perhaps I was hoping for the film to be like ""Tampopo"" or ""Happiness of the Katakuris"", all I know is that it left me very flat.By the way, although I did not adore the film, one thing sure struck me. The kids in the classroom were horrible--badly behaved, obnoxious and jerks. I assume this was meant as parody, as Jpaanese kids have fantastic reputations for studying and working hard...and NOT being total jerks. These kids were much, much worse behaved than any of the high and middle school kids I ever taught--and American kids are famous for being ill-behaved slackers.

After a great start (Daredevil 1, Jessica Jones 1), the franchise soon got caught up in intransparent and therefore unmotivated plotlines, dragging the interesting characters and their personal conflicts out to the point where the viewer didn't care anymore. The Punisher 2, however, makes good on that by way of three significant changes:a) The plot is simple, even though it combines two only mildly connected plotlines. Both are basic enough (revenge drama + hunter-hunted drama) so as not to get confusing, in fact, they make for a good variation and keep each other interesting.b) Simple plot allows focus on characters, especially the villain and side characters. The protagonist gets also a new sidekick, which adds comedy and believable growth to the story. The series lives off the the relationships between people, not their personal conflicts. Plus, all those relationships are relatable and well acted.c) Simple plot also gives room for efforts in storytelling. There are a lot of smaller and bigger highlights throughout the season, my personal favourite being Episode 3. The whole show is not about what is happening, but how exactly it is happening, and you can tell the creators enjoyed the production.Combine these new focuspoints with awesome action and you end up with a thoroughly enjoyable series.

I mean, someone wrote about the mental state of two girls who like to create fake 'death scenes' - oh goodness, are we going to get all politically correct here too? Who says youngsters are never morbid and fascinated by death? Sure they are, some of them. Heard of Halloween? And aren't such types often budding horror-movie-makers in the making? Best of all were the reviews complaining that werewolves don't really act this way, that they don't change this way, etc. Seriously? I mean, really, seriously? :-D I've got some news - there are no such things as a werewolves.Movie makers, authors, screenwriters, have always played with folklore characters, bending and breaking rules. Vampire movies and books are especially well known for it - think of the twinkling vampires in the Twilight saga, all living together in a designer house with not a coffin in sight. Anything goes, you know, and just because Bram Stoker had his Dracula (great book) climbing up walls and not liking stake and garlic, doesn't mean to say that all vampires are like that. Oh, I forgot, there are no such things as vampires (except vampire bats etc).Ginger Snaps is hilariously gory and fits right into the dark comedy/horror genre. It's not for the squeamish but some seem to be taking it way too seriously. There are actually some similarities to the cult horror 'Lost Boys' (a superior movie, I confess). Instead of two brothers we have two sisters, the younger looking out for the older. There's the scatty devoted mother and instead of a grandfather who pretty much lets the women around him get on with it, there is the sisters' father who pretty much lets the women around him get on with it.Ginger Snaps is not meant to be taken seriously.

146,3148060,2016-09-17,ppardoematthews,Ben-Hur (2016),6.0,"The big question is, how does the 2016 version of ""Ben-Hur"" compare with its 1959 counterpart? To start with, the whole story is told in about the same duration as just Part One of the 1959 epic, so there are lots of plot and character reductions. Totally missing is Quintus Arrius, who was central to both the sea battle and for setting up Judah Ben-Hur's subsequent bid for freedom and his chariot racing career via adoption into Roman society. Someone called Quintus does crop up in a very minor role, but is probably not the same person at all. Jesus Christ's appearances, although significant, are very limited, almost to the extent of making him anonymous, so non-believers will need to dust off their family Bibles to work out what he was all about, not that you'll find any reference to Ben-Hur in either the New or Old Testaments. Little is shown of the Hur household to suggest status; they come across as fairly ordinary people, sufficiently well-to-do to maintain a family of home-helps and the odd refugee, but they don't boast quite the opulence implied in the 1959 version. However, they obviously look after their roof tiles; in fact their DIY is so good that dodgy roofing doesn't need to be featured at all in the entry to Jerusalem ""accident"". Typical of Twenty-First Century screen presentations, the plot commences with an exciting preview of the famous chariot race to get the audience's adrenalin rushing before settling down to tell the story that led up to it. Unexpectedly, more is actually shown and told of Judah's early relationship with Messala in the new version, also Judah's marriage to Esther is established early on, and Judah's mother has changed her name yet again (since the 2010 TV series). Sheik Ilderim does a very thorough job coaching Judah in the finer technicalities of chariot driving to the extent that his enthusiasm for tutoring overlaps into the race itself, nearly scuppering the whole exercise (visions of an uncontrollable football manager invading the touchline), not that Judah would have heard what was being shouted at him above the pandemonium because Bluetooth wasn't around that long ago. The chariot race of 2016 itself looks highly convincing as the cameras aren't obviously under-cranked to simulate greater speeds than the actors/stunt team were actually capable of achieving in the 1959 version without risking unnecessary casualties; also, modern CGI has done away with wobbly back-projection, and works to very good effect except for depicting the misadventures of a runaway horse. The naval scenes earlier in the story are shown almost entirely from below deck, so you can't see where the filming tank joins up with the scenic backdrop; frustratingly, during the battle you don't see much else, either. At the conclusion of the film there is an unexpected double happy-ending twist to the story – a means perhaps of opening the door for at least one obligatory sequel, if not a lengthy franchise. Maybe by then the chariots will have grown wings, and Ben-Hur will be in conflict with the Son of Smaug.The whole story whizzes along at a relentless pace, thanks to the camera being almost constantly mobile and hand-held, often very shakily regardless of the subject matter (never heard of Steadicam?), making the whole thing look as if it has been shot by an excited child who keeps looking back over his shoulder to seek his parents' approval instead of concentrating on what is actually being framed in the viewfinder. One can only surmise how vomit inducing this must look in an IMAX theatre. The high edit count makes the effort seem more like a salvage job than a work of art, and some horrendous jump cuts are employed to speed up the narrative. Worse, much of the film is shot in telescopic perspective, cramming the screen with close-ups as though intended to be shown on a small TV stuck in a corner of the living room instead of in the grandeur of a cinema. Even from the back of a standard auditorium this ""blown-up"" effect is very in-your-face, that doesn't allow the 3-D much depth opportunity except in the big action set pieces where it is given a rare chance to stretch out, and then it looks amazing.There are few big names in the leading parts, avoiding the distraction of guessing who's playing who. The main characters are well drawn with the exception of Pontius Pilate who comes over even weaker and more stupid than he may have been (possibly miscast but actually played by a very competent and normally impressive actor, so his portrayal could have been intentional). Everyone appears very natural for the times and places depicted – the men look suitably tanned and unkempt, although the principal protagonists do get a ""Toni&Guy"" makeover for their potentially terminal arena appearance; the women hardly come from a cat-walk background, yet are very charismatic. Much of the architecture is appropriately mundane except for public edifices. In contrast to the squeaky-clean Charlton Heston version, there is a true-to-life rawness here. Even the sun rarely seems to shine, and everything looks a lot greyer than in 1959 Technicolor, not that one is given much chance to admire the scenery. Has our air pollution really worsened so much in half a century?It's quite likely that people with a modicum of perception would describe this ""Ben-Hur"" as interesting, rather than notable. 2016 youngsters will surely lap it up as a yet another tour de force of crash-bang-wallop entertainment, just as the kids of 1959 enjoyed their version for its sheer majesty, a cast to die for, and the way it drew its audience into the depths of the story – and still does, many years later.

(Really ""Girl loses boy"" here, as this is Lake Bell's film.) I'm not as familiar with Simon Pegg as some UK reviewers here so I didn't see him as being ""miscast"" as others have suggested. I thought he was great.It's been said before but Lake Bell nailed her accent (in my untrained American opinion) to the point I thought she had been masking it in the few other films in which I'd seen her. As I said this is her film and she is terrific.I had a quibble when I wondered why Jack would actually enter the women's toilet (which of course punched up the Sean/Nancy gag), but both Nancy and he were quite tipsy so I can accept his action there. I LOVED their reactions after that, where they each fell back in their protective shells and argued using phrases those particular characters would have probably used before. Even the silliness of Nancy running/biking back to the cantina seemed borne from hurt (and a need to show him she wasn't.) The entire second go-round in the cantina with each other and with his ex I thought was spot on, with the perfect ""closure"" punchline.Those reviewers who expected more outright comedy I can understand as there's not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, but the wry moments mixed with pathos to me struck the right chord to match these two lonely hearts. This script could even have been reworked as a straight drama with comedic elements and I think it would've been watchable. I hope that writer Tess Morris gets more opportunities, and Ben Palmer more feature directing chances, they deserve it.The only quibble other than the somewhat-over-the-top choreographed end run, which by then I was enjoying the silliness of it, was I didn't think the two characters would've waited til they were back in the train station to have the conversation that (temporarily) separated them, I think Nancy would've already invited Jack to the party by then or certainly Jack would've switched his phone on to check on the real Jessica earlier (probably when he was in the cab to the cantina racing Nancy.) I'd love to know if the writer set that up, or the director re-staged that in order to have them ironically part under the clock wherethey first met.But I didn't think of any of that til later so my wife (who loved this film too) still talks to me!",479,0,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

There are a lot, A LOT of missing things... but well it's acceptable in the movies. The unacceptable is to change the whole story, landscapes, characters, etc.

Another point to reconsider seriously are the special effects... in Russia there are a lot of talented people to do something on the Hollywood level, and in this movie they should do a better effort.

Fights... It's disgusting to see people fighting in this movie. I like all kinds of fights without fire arms, there are a lot of movies with good fights out there. Good moves, synchronized and fluent... here you'll find a lot of changing very fast bad pictures.

The good includes a beautiful, more modern aesthetic (compared to the previous Spider-Man films), a for the most part very good cast, and an admirable effort to build more technical/""realistic"" explanation into the back story. That being said, to me it fails as a reboot because far too much of it feels both highly derivative of, and sadly inferior to, last decade's Spider-Man 1 and 2. When rebooting a franchise, the last thing that you want the audience to be thinking as they watch the film is, ""this is really a lot like the other version, but not really as good."" That thought went through my mind multiple times. The other problem, which is sort of the same problem, is that the villain was just not convincing. Too clichéd, again too derivative of both Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, without being nearly as well fleshed out or understandable, and thus not nearly as truly menacing. Also, the villain's form, literally, did not make sense. I will not spoil that, but the character's visual design is incongruous, which make him harder to buy into. The exposition was lacking in some other key areas, as well. I will say that the cast was terrific, in particular Emma Stone, Sally Field and Martin Sheen, in addition to Andy Garfield. It is saying something that they fully atone for the absence of the much-beloved Toby and Kirsten. The Spidey costume is awesome as well.

It was one of those books that when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. In most cases the book is going to be better than the actual movie, and the reason why is the book goes into much more detail about his life story than the movie. Obviously the movie can't show every event, otherwise its going to be a ten hour movie.Being a Die-hard Micky Ward fan, it was somewhat unussual watching someone else play him, and I had a hard time getting used to that. Saying that, I wasn't disappointed when I watched the movie. I thought Christian Bale did an excellent job in portraying Ward's half brother DickEklund, and Mark Walhberg was very convincing playing Micky. I didn't like how Ward's sisters were depicted. They were portrayed as being somewhat homely, unattractive and they didn't have any dialogue. Its almost like they were part of a posse. In reality, some of Wards sister's are very pretty.The fight scenes were pretty good, although I thought they should have shown the Ward - Green fight which was the Friday Night Fight on ESPN. I thought that was the fight that actually turned the corner for Micky. The way in which Micky was able to come back and stop Reggie Green put Micky into prime time, and Reggie Green into retirement.I would have liked to seen the Ward Gatti trilogy, but I believe they may save that for ""The Fighter II"".All in all, I enjoyed it. Micky Ward was definitely a blue collar fighter, and he gave it everything he got, he earned every penny he made and he was a true fan's fighter.

157,1714530,2008-10-22,gentendo,The Painted Veil (2006),10.0,"One particular scene in The Painted Veil that functions as a raissoneur (moment or speech that represents the author's point-of-view) is when Norton offers to buy Watts some flowers at a local town nursery. She bleakly responds, ""Why would you want to buy something that's going to die the following week?"" Feeling somewhat rejected, Norton shyly replies, ""I thought it would be a nice idea."" The environment and exchange of dialogue here is extremely important because it helps create the rest of the story's subtext, and so the author's point-of-view. The subtext revealed in this scene asks a certain philosophical question: Why should anyone fight for anything knowing that death is inevitable? The author seems to suggest that unless this question is answered, major social epidemics will occur.One epidemic depicted in this story is unhappiness. Both Norton and Watts play characters that embody this social plague as types of the many who also suffer with the same. Their unhappiness comes as a result of struggling to answer the author's question.Watts desires adventure, romance and overall life fulfillment, and yet her internal battle becomes: ""Why should I fight to save my decaying marriage when my unhappiness is obviously caused by my negligent and unsatisfying husband?"" Unsure of how to answer, she behaves immorally through a passionate love-affair in order to justify her ill feelings. She is flawed by her actions, however, because she does not ultimately gain what she wants. She gains a transitory romance at the cost of giving birth to another social epidemic: spousal infidelity. With Watts' character, the author seems to be doing two things: 1). Making a commentary on how unhappy married couples are more susceptible of infidelity than happy ones; 2). Illustrates that unless we fight to sustain what's most important in life, there's no purpose to even live.Norton, on the other hand, wants to maintain his noble profession and satisfy others with what he knows, yet does so at the cost of isolating the one closest to himhis wife. He lives in a self-absorbed bubble, tries his best to please others, but is awkward and often holds grudges. His selfishness causes his wife to lose her marital stamina, and when she commits adultery, he introduces another social epidemic: non-forgiveness. His refusal to forgive her causes him deep pain and unhappiness; his internal question becomes: ""Why should I forgive her for such cruel and intolerable behavior?"" The author uses Norton's character as an opportunity for viewers to reflect within themselves: ""Am I truly happier when I hold grudges?"" Through the course of the story, however, both characters recognize that they relied far too much upon the other for their happiness. They were both being selfish. It is not until they go to China to fight the cholera epidemic that their marital issues become slowly resolved. The reason is because they no longer concentrate on their own lives, but on the lives of those dying around them. Their nobility shines in the face of adversity; she joins the nun's convent to help raise orphans, he saves the town's water supply and many ill-stricken citizens. The scenario posed from the beginning at the flower shop comes full circle at the end: Watts' attitude towards buying flowers changesshe now wants to buy them despite knowing their corruptibility. It's as if the author was suggesting the familiar credo all along, ""It is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all."" We fight for life because we love to live.",584,0,,0,"No reference.

Home Video put out a batch of videotapes featuring episodes of assorted archive television series under the collective title of 'T.V. Heaven' ( pinched from a Channel 4 series ). Alongside old favourites like 'The Saint' and 'Randall & Hopkirk ( Deceased )', there were a few lesser-known shows, such as 'Seaway', 'Father Brown', and 'Spyder's Web'. I recalled the latter when it was first transmitted on I.T.V. back in 1972. The episode chosen to represent the Richard Harris-created spy series was Roy Clarke's 'Romance On Wheels'. The Web investigates the activities of a London-based company known as 'Romance On Wheels', a combined dating agency and travel agent. Single people can take a holiday and ( hopefully ) pair off with one another. 'Clive Hawksworth' ( Anthony Ainley ) joins the latest batch of clients, posing under the name 'Wormley'. 'Lottie Dean' ( Patricia Cutts ) is with him too, as a loud and lusty divorcée ( not too far removed from the real Lottie, in other words ). The trip ventures behind the Iron Curtain, where they meet the sinister 'Grovnik' ( Peter Sallis, who would reunite shortly with Roy Clarke for 'Last Of The Summer Wine' ). The clients are being murdered and their identities given to enemy agents, who then fly back to England to inveigle themselves into society.'Spyder's Web' was a comedy spy thriller in the mould of 'The Avengers'. Though lacking that filmed programme's gloss and charm, it got by on the strength of its scripts - some top writers, such as Robert Holmes, Alfred Shaughnessy and Marc Brandel, worked on the show - and the performances of the cast. Cutts and Ainley are an odd couple alright; he is British and reserved, while she is raucous and ribald. In supporting roles are lovely Veronica Carlson and the late Roger Lloyd Pack. 'Romance on Wheels' was a good choice to represent the show as it has witty lines and nice guest stars, particularly Carolyn Jones ( 'Crossroads' fans will remember her as 'Sharon Metcalfe' ) and Mollie Maureen. Sallis' 'Grovnik' steals the show. I was disappointed when more 'Spyder' episodes failed to appear in the 90's.

Dreadlocked, handsome Orfeu, who has achieved local fame through the success of his shows at the Sambadrome faces the usual pressures of a celebrity who comes from poor beginnings.  He chooses to remain living in the favela, he claims, to show the youth that there is more than one way to success, the other way being that of his 'almost brother', Lucinho, a psychotic gang leader who reigns over the 'hood with drugs and terror.  When beautiful, otherworldly Eurydice arrives in the rough-hewn streets to visit a distant aunt she captures Orfeu's heart, much to the disdain of the local women, most of whom have some claim on him, whether real or imagined. The two find true love against a pulsating backdrop of Carnival performances, jealousy, police violence, interfering relatives, and flimsy homes held together by not much more than romantic and colorful scarves.

First off the visuals are excellent the visuals are truly some of the best.The look of explosions and battle worn areas in the middle east is intense.It's great to just look around(when your not getting shot at) and realize the scope of how much work was put into the game to make it look so good.The sound is great its like they went onto an actual battlefield and recorded everything.Explosions and gunshots sound just so great its probably as best there gonna get for the moment.Voice acting was great the actors did a stand up job sounding like the characters they were.It's always great when a voice actor does a great job and makes the character more believable.Game play is the best Call of Duty game play ever.Nothing was wrong with it unlike Call of Duty 3 which seemed to have physics to have problems as often id get stuck on a tire.Coming off that note the physics and frame rate are excellent and hardly ever falter.The controls in this game were tight and easy to learn.This COD game perfected the throw back grenade function which was first introduced in COD3.The use of a knife as a melee attack was also entertaining and to me was more believable then beating a man to death with a rifle butt.Guns seemed to be as strong as they should be and fired like they should.For once a storyline was attempted that didn't all but just make you want to skip the cut scenes as it was interesting and could draw you in.The one thing i wished there was more of was guns. There are a lot of guns there but there all kind of obvious that they would be there for example there were just about 2 million times i could of used an AK-47 i know its one of the most mass produced guns in the world but add more variety come on. Also many times i found myself forced to use an m4 assault carbine and had few chances to use an m-16 which i believe is a better gun.I found it a little odd the British S.A.S. was using the m4 and not the standard British rifle the L85 which was a gun i was really hoping to see.(I only have this problem with the campaign.) Multiplayer leaves nothing to be desired.The multiplayer is excellent its easy to just jump in and play the game and actually be good at it.There is a good variety of weapons on multiplayer and some customization to be done to the weapons.Plenty of match types that people could want or need.All around Call of Duty is the best war game i have ever played and I've played enough of them.I own it for the ps3 and have not experienced many problems with it.Best war game out there and best COD of the series.,499,0,,0,No reference.

169,970254,2005-06-10,Theo Robertson,The Defenders: Taking the First (1998 TV Movie),4.0,"I've never thought much of THE DEFENDERS TVMs mainly because of the liberal do gooder subtext that bashes the audience over the head at every single opportunity so when the teleplay started I instantly knew where it was going . A right wing rabble rouser called John Walker stands on campus calling for Americans to take back their country . A lone Latino protester heckles Mr right wing guy and on the way home he bumps into some of the rabble rouser's vanguard .!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! As I said I knew where this was going . The Latino defends himself against the bad guys and finds himself on a murder charge but this doesn't happen as the Latino is beaten to death , so I guess credit where it's due since this plot twist surprised me and we see Preston and Preston , who if you've seen previous TVMs in THE DEFENDERS series will know are bleeding heart liberals , having to defend a misguided teenager up on a racist murder charge . So far so good and if the story continued in this vein it would certainly have been very interesting for this viewer . Unfortunately this is skated over very briefly and the story once again becomes a liberal crusade against conservative values I don't want to give the impression that it's because of politics that I disliked TAKING THE FIRST but as with the previous TVMs in the series we're not exactly asked to be impartial as to who the good guys and bad guys are . Can't the audience make up their own minds ? The rather polemical scripting doesn't allow the audience to think for themselves which is slightly insulting . But it's with the rather dubious legal arguments that the main problem lies - If someone makes a rather extreme speech and them someone decides to further a vaguely similar cause through violence does this mean the person making the speech is responsible ? Highly unlikely and the arguments put forward are badly explored too I would say that THE DEFENDERS: TAKING THE FIRST is probably the best in the series but considering the very low marks I gave the previous two TVMs that's not much of a compliment and this ( Final ? ) story in the series suffers from all the problems like highly unlikely legal arguments and too much liberal politics as the other stories that preceded it",408,0,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

This movie did justice to the concept of family by adding a few laughs here and there and even memorable lines that still give me chuckles. The chemistry between Vanessa (elllen page) and chuck (thomas Haden church) provided seamless foundation that did not make this movie lag. However, I am still questioning on Sara Jessica parker, who I thought provided for the awkwardness of the movie. Parker and Quad had an oddball chemistry that made several scenes actually boring and dragging.

It's the story of Henry Hill, from the day he decided he wanted to be a gangster until the day he joined the Witness Protection Program.   All along the movie, he sticks with crazy Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and living-mob-legend, Jimmy Conway (De Niro) as they work for Paulie (Paul Sorvino).  All goes well for Henry until he starts cheating on his wife and then gets sent to jail.  The scenes in the jail where you see where wiseguys live apart from the rest of the prisoners are excellent (especially when Henry describes diner in jail).  As good as Liotta, Bracco , De Niro, and Sorvino are though, it's Joe Pesci who rules this movie.  His incarnation of the crazy, cowboy-like, short-tempered Tommy De Vito, he is excellent and it's understandable that he won the Oscar for best supporting-actor (he also supplies a lot of the laughs).

With nowhere else to go, he makes his way back home to Queens where he has not been since his father's death many, many years before. He has barely spoken with his mother in the interim and now he overstates his role with the band to her - manager, writer, producer, etc. He tries to collect himself to deal with this massive setback, but he is not making the situation any better with angry calls to the band's actual manager.I think that roadie is one of the coolest jobs in the world next to rock star and Jimmy does as well. I, too, would have major problems dealing with his rude awakening after so many years and the loss of his livelihood and dream.Out for some butter for his Mom's famous tuna melts, Jimmy runs into a high school classmate who is and was quite a butt-head who is now married to Jimmy's first love, Nikki. Jimmy and Nikki wind up back in his boyhood room which is untouched by time and looks like a ""rock and roll museum"" according to Nikki.Out of his vinyl record collection, Nikki pulls out Ratcity In Blue by, local 70s favorites, the Good Rats and they listen to a couple of tracks. This brings back memories of seeing the band every Saturday night with their friend Steph - who passed away unbeknownst to Jimmy.This movie is about real people, with lots of issues, who love music and are dealing with some very real problems. If you enjoy music, have been on the road with a band or thought about doing so (one of my life's regrets is turning down an offer to be a roadie) you will really like this movie.Full disclosure - I also own this ""original"" album with the cool pizza sleeve art, am a huge Good Rats fan and may have seen Steph, Nikki and Jimmy at one of those Saturday night shows back in the day.

Friends shows six roommates sharing a luxury apartment all with fantastic jobs. Joey is an Actor for god sake. Del is a fly pitcher.

As a casual sci-fi fan, I have to say that I get excited when good sci-fi comes around. I first heard about Serenity 4 or 5 months ago when I saw the teaser trailer, and from then on, I was intrigued. I managed to get my hands on the Firefly episodes, and I watched each one of them, simply in awe of the world that was created, but more specifically the characters. I've seen Serenity twice now. I have not stopped thinking about it since. Its the best kind of film experience...one that hits you emotionally, and yet entertains you at the same time. Having been a Firefly fan, I do have a little bit of a bias, and certainly many of the character moments were much more impacting, simply because of my previous knowledge, but don't let this stop you from seeing this amazing piece of sci-fi. Joss Whedon has done something fantastic by not letting special effects cloud the story. Story and characters are top notch, taking well known clichés, but making them unusual despite that fact. The action is intense and unrelenting, with hardly a moment to breathe in the films climactic moments. The film deserves a 10 out of 10 because of its daring, and its success on almost all fronts. Its not a perfect film, don't get me wrong, but it is leaps and bounds above anything else this genre has produced in the past 20 or so years. It deserves high marks, simply for its gumption.

178,1347217,2006-12-09,hankhanks12345,Pearl Harbor (2001),1.0,"Let me explain what I mean when I say that this movie is shameful crap.

First, the crap part. It's pretty obvious in watching this that the screenplay is junk the director doesn't know how to direct actors at all, and as a result the acting is terrible too. It brings new meaning to the word ""trite."" There are a few scenes that look good on the screen, such as the part with the Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball and the like. Never mind that there probably weren't many kids playing baseball first thing in the morning on Sunday, but whatever, the image was at least striking. I'll give it that. It can't really make up for the junky love story, however.

Now, why I use the word shameful. This isn't some fictional event, it was an actual event in relatively recent history (in the grand scheme of things) in which quite a few people actually died. Not only that, but it started in motion a chain of events that was very serious, resulted in a tremendous amount of sacrifice, and should be treated with at least some respect. It deserves better than a crap-o treatment by Michael Bay, the king of schlocky movies.

The premise of the film sees a woman and a young lawyer attempt to retrieve a piece of stolen art from the Austrian government. Helen mirren is obviously one of the most iconic actresses ever and she is great in this film. She had allot of depth to her character and you really do care about her character in this film as she truly tries to do whats right. Ryan reynolds was really really good in this film and delivered a very surprising performance. He was funny but he was a complex character that definitely had dramatic qualities to him. Daniel bruhl and katie holmes are both good additions to this film even though there not in the film that much. The story of mirrens battle is interesting and as the film progresses it becomes more emotionally investing to both reynolds character and the audience. However, this film has allot of flashbacks that really just didn't do anything for me and I feel like they were just in there to extend the run time of the film. The script had some good emotional moments and some well placed humour but I do feel like it was missing more power scenes and the flashbacks didn't have very interesting dialogue at all. The style of this film is its biggest weakness, I know this film is based on a true story but the pacing is a big issue.

182,2563551,2013-11-22,chaos-rampant,Silent Light (2007),,"I urge readers to watch this. The story is touching and human. A family man who is seized by a new inexplicable love that tells him the old love, what he used to think as love, was merely peace and habit, and yet he can't be sure. Is the new one merely passion? Does he have a right to betray the trust? Deny himself happiness? It is the most profoundly troubling question that I imagine can arise in a lifetime.The film is merely one possible outcome, how making a choice can upset the whole universe, the question itself is much more difficult and deep. If you're 18 the gravity of it might not register, you still have second and third chances ahead of you. But after a certain age, I imagine it becomes entirely cosmic, entirely about choosing the last person you're going to know and love. My only quibble about this is the stifled Germanic presence all through the film. I'm talking about the deliberately inexpressive faces, pauses and careful poses, people arranged in symmetries around objects, none of which is artful in my world. Well art can be anything so it is not that so much as choosing the world you're going to live in and I'll have none of that stylized pouting in my home, suffering can never be an aesthetic.Yet in this hard shell there is a softly pounding heart of beauty.One is how this harsh German presence is softened by the afterglow of a sweeter sun and rolling Mexican landscape, which is where the film takes place. Mellowed in this way it brings to the fore a quality I admire in Protestants: simple lives, joy in austerity and nonattachment. Though it came from historical necessity, it's still the closest thing to Zen we've known in Europe.The other thing is even simpler yet that much more beautiful. The film is shot in long quiet sweeps of ordinary nothing, those who keep in touch know I am frequently vexed by this technique because it so often becomes merely about style instead of sculpted insight, a garment worn a certain way. Transcendent vision in film, which is at its most powerful, is about unconcealing a fuller sense of world, broader horizons. It cannot be a proclamation of love but a gesture that embodies what it means to; words are just too easy and cheap, whereas the visible action is itself the commitment.Here we have something that is elegant and simple in just the right measure.In the story we have new love that extends from the old, a new feeling, new beginnings one after the other, not always the one desired or anticipated. All through the film we have a dozen or so subtle metaphors about just this feeling of unconcealing a new world, of reaching an end which is only the start of the next landscape.My favorite are the following two. A combine threshes a wheatfield, a violent, clustered image of uprooting, only to arrive at the end of the field at an open horizon of fields. And even greater, during the river scene, the man and soon-to-be betrayed wife embrace as their children wash below, still close, their bodies leave the frame and we're left for several lingering moments in the hazy unfocused space of their absence, only for the camera to slowly find and focus on a blossoming flower.Breathtaking!So when she departs in the end and miraculously comes to again, it the same inner blossom from nothing, call it a sense of the mother still being in the world. The world does not end so long as we keep this anticipation of presence, fields to see after this one, new people to love, never bogged down by loss. The hazy landscape of seeming nothingness already contains the flower, in that scene it is neither there as we don't see it nor not there as it is there to be found, and this all has its meditative sense. I'm glad for this film. From now on, whenever it happens that I have to try and illustrate the Buddhist notion of emptiness, or shunyata, I will reach for this one scene.Something to meditate upon.",696,0,,0,"No reference.

Political opinions don't appear in my reviews very often, but I can't help wonder if many of those opposing 'Death with Dignity' might feel differently if they found themselves in Anna's situation. The film opens with her in a doctor's office obviously receiving the most dreaded of news. The camera remains on her face. There is no dialogue, only her last moment gasp before we move to the opening credits.Anna Camp (""True Blood"") stars as Anna, diagnosed with terminal cancer. She has explored every possible treatment, including those in the experimental stage. Since none are an option for her, she has decided to move back to Oregon, where death with dignity is an option. She shows up unannounced on the front porch of her younger brother Michael's (Steven Strait) house. The two haven't seen each other in many years - not since their father kicked her out for being a lesbian. The father is now deceased and his ashes are in a file box in Michael's spare room.The once close siblings re-connect quickly as the pain of the past is released. They laugh, reminisce and get caught up. Michael works in IT, and Anna is an established artist in Salt Lake City, where she's a homeowner with her partner Luisa (Kristin Taylor). Over the course of a few days, Anna meets Michael's girlfriend Shonda (Chloe Mason), and his neighbor Gary (Joe Lo Truglio, ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine""). Gary has Asperger's, plus a few other afflictions, and often pops in for a scoop of Michael's sugar.Anna is not prepared for Michael's backlash to her decision, and that leads to heartfelt conversation, as well as an initially defensive Luisa when she arrives. It's touching to see how Shonda and Gary react, and to see Michael's emotional evolution. Of course, he doesn't want to lose his beloved sister - the one he's only just reconnected with. We can all relate to his feelings. But as Anna says, it's her decision and she would rather go out on her own terms, than in a cold hospital with tubes sticking out.This is the directorial debut and first screenplay from Tim True, who shares ties to Oregon with his co-writer Csaba Mera. Of course this is a tough and controversial topic. We witness Anna's labored breathing and the other effects of late stage cancer, and the heaviness is offset a bit thanks to Gary's t-shirts and coffee mugs. An alternative title to the film could be 'the long goodbye', but Anna's farewell is handled very well by the actors and filmmakers. Anna recites a poem (from Mary Lee Hall) with the line, ""Turn again to life, and smile"", and we realize she's made the decision that's right for her.

187,3128824,2016-08-14,AlsExGal,Ghost (1990),9.0,"I have to admit that Demi Moore as artist Molly and Patrick Swayze as Sam, an investment banker, had great chemistry. This was extremely popular when it came out in 1990, even winning an academy award for Whoopi Goldberg, whose career had been on a downturn up to that point.

Sam and Molly have a great life in New York City. She is an up and coming artist, he is doing well at his investment banking job. They turn part of a run down building into a yuppie paradise loft apartment. But Sam has a problem expressing his love verbally. And then Sam and Molly are mugged by a common street criminal one night while walking home. Sam is shot and killed while defending Molly, and suddenly finds himself outside of his own body. Nobody can hear him. Nobody can see him. But he can converse with other ""ghosts"" that he finds. He hangs out in his old apartment to be near Molly, and then something happens that makes him think his murder was not a coincidence. The guy who killed him lets himself into his apartment with a key and begins looking for something in particular. He is obviously not there to steal the television. And from there the murder mystery begins.

I still salute this movie for one inventive turn - the most unlikely protagonist ally in film history - Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic who turns out to be the only person who can hear Sam. She is rude, crude, at times greedy, somewhat racist and very mouthy and with a rap sheet a mile long for bunco artistry. But she does end up helping Sam, although he spends all night at her bedside singing ""I'm Henry VIII I am"" to get her to cooperate. However, you will like her, in part because she is so real and believable.

The philosophical questions I mentioned? I guess the biggest question raised is who is a ""good"" person worthy of heaven and who is a ""bad"" person worthy of hell? Are there mitigating circumstances? The film has both of Sam's murderers going to hell. Were they BOTH that bad? One of the killers seemed like he might have been a good person until greed tempted him to the point that he got in over his head for some quick money. He was like Fred C. Dobbs in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" without the gold mine and the endless Mexican desert. And what about Sam? He kills two people , at first attacking them to defend others - and it has got to be scary being chased and beat up by something you can't see - but he seems to have fun scaring them to the point of frenzy.

Neither the title of the film or the cover of the DVD provide any evidence to the contrary. But both the title and artwork are misleading however. Surprisingly given the subject matter the actual story is a subtle and complex study of the relationships between the three main characters in the film, each one caught up, often reluctantly in the world of the Krays.The story deals with true events surrounding the escape of Krays associate Frank Mitchell from Dartmoor prison in December 1966. The Krays mastermind the escape, then hide Frank and his minder John in a London flat. Later they provide him with a female escortThe screenplay was adapted by Gill Adams from her original award winning stage play 'Jump to Cow Heaven' and though extended and altered it shares the emotional impact of the theatrical version. Frank Mitchell, John and Lisa are not the stock characters commonly portrayed in this genre. Perhaps surprisingly the film is as much a love story as it is a portrayal of gangland life.The three principal actors all give excellent performances. The role of escaped convict Frank Michell played by Diarmaid Murtagh is a particularly difficult one, as he is often an annoying and sometimes violent presence, who is at times difficult to empathise with. But by the end of the film we have a very different impression of him. He like John, his minder and Lisa his escort are victims and prisoners caught up in the orbit of the Krays. Morgan Watkins brings great warmth and subtlety to a world weary John. However I think the outstanding performance in the film belongs to Elen Rhys as the escort brought in to entertain and pacify Frank. Though outwardly confident her vulnerability is also evident and both aspects of her personality are skilfully and convincingly presented.First time director Will Kerley, known best previously for his work in opera also directed the original stage play and his familiarity with the characters ensures
that the nuances in their personalities and their developing relationships are well handled.The Krays themselves are minor characters in the story, though their uneasy and ultimately malign presence are constantly apparent. The tension builds as it
becomes clear that Frank's dreams of a pardon freedom look unlikely to be
fulfilled and we have sympathy for his predicament, that of John and particularly the frightened Lisa. An emotionally rich and carefully crafted film.",433,0,,0,"No reference.

His therapist is an abrasive loose cannon, who has methods that are unorthodox to say the least. Considering Dave's lonely life, meeting Buddy Rydell might be a blessing in disguise for him. I originally saw this in theaters and remember being highly amused by this movie. I didn't remember much about it...and decided to re-watch it. I enjoy Sandler's older movies when he actually cared about making people laugh. I wouldn't call this movie the perfect comedy by any means, but there are definitely some laugh out loud moments to be had. It's a little sad to see Nicholson stoop to these antics, but I'm not ashamed to admit that he was hilarious. He works well with Sandler and steals many of the scenes. I laughed my ass off at one of his quotes. ""Then he pulled out his winky and told her it was a Strawberry Ice Cream Cone"" He even sings ""I Feel Pretty"" with Adam Sandler! Nicholson isn't afraid to make a fool of himself in this movie and looked to be having a blast! The guy can turn anything into gold. Beneath him or not, he was amazing. It does get stagnant after a while, but for about 75-80 minutes, it's good times. It has your typical crudeness with Sandler's patented ""childish routine"" but he is funny. It's not a strong acting performance, but he is very entertaining! That's all that counts for me. Marisa Tomei's character is somewhat bland, but she's easy on the eyes and delivers an OK performance. Woody Harrelson has a small, but funny part. The last 25 minutes get sentimental and mushy, with a pretty clever twist that surprised me with how well it was executed. I used to be a big Adam Sandler fan! Hell, I still am to a certain extent. I'm just tired of being let down by his laziness. This movie does what it sets out to do, giving the viewer some outrageous laughs. That's what I wanted and that's exactly what I got. Remember!

198,2672324,2014-06-02,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Universal Soldier: The Return (1999),2.0,"After Roland Emmerich's Universal Soldier (1992), the series was capitalized on its success by producing sequels to it that were released on TV. However, these ""sequels"" as they were called, were received poorly due to fans' lack of interest and a far less entertaining cast. Then 1999 rolled around and Universal Soldier fans were surprised to see this come to their TV informing them trailer style that Van Damme was returning. It's curious to say what the title to this actual sequel just meant ""the return"" of. Was it the return of Jean-Claude Van Damme as Luc Deveraux? Or was it that the plot to this installment revolved around Deveraux returning to a similar station where Unisols were created just like him? Maybe it wasn't even that deep. Perhaps the producers just meant it was the return from the TV productions back into actual theatrically released movies. No one will know and probably not many will care either because this installment barely qualifies as a sequel.

The reason why it is difficult for this movie to be called a sequel to the 1992 original is because of how flimsy the writing connects to its predecessor. After the 1992 film, there wasn't anybody left working on the Unisol project. Everyone except Deveraux had died because of how badly the project turned out to be. Yet, here we are (with no perception of how much time has passed between both films), Deveraux is now one of the leads of operation at a new Unisol factory. Apparently he acquired his humanity back from two meaningless scientists that have very little importance later on in the film. During a regular day, the main computer system (S.E.T.H. - voiced by Michael Jai White) becomes self-aware and decides that it's time he takes control. So who exactly approved the Unisol program? Plus, all the scientists were dead. Who knew how to regenerate more dead soldiers? It was a tiny select group of people.

But this is the least of the problems. First of all, why is Deveraux assisting in the creation of more Unisols? What's his motivation behind this? What possible benefit could he have from this if he knows exactly what could go wrong? It doesn't make any sense. There's even a scene where Deveraux has a flashback to his death and the kind of treatment he was given when he was a Unisol. This almost hints at that Deveraux isn't passed his own stress, but it's never visited again. Deveraux even has a daughter named Hillary who he named after his wife of the same name - wait what? In the 1992 movie, the nosey news reporter was named Veronica and most fans can safely agree that it looked like the future couple was going to be Deveraux and Veronica. Where did this Hillary girl come in? Even more insulting is how obvious and obligatory it becomes when Deveraux comes in contact with another thickheaded female reporter, guess where that goes.

These issues alone amount to a very confusing, poorly written main character that feels like a totally different person. Forget trying to even understand anyone else that's brought in because his or her development is given far less attention. The villain played by Michael Jai White brings up multiple questions as well. Just because a computer system becomes self-aware does not mean it all of sudden knows how to perform martial arts. S.E.T.H.'s motivations are also unexplained besides him wanting to rid the world of chaos. I assume this was apart of the fad for 1999 - making all computers self aware and ready to massacre mankind. Then there's Bill Goldberg as the skull-smashing wrestler turned Unisol. The only thing audiences will know about him is that he hates Deveraux. Why - no will know because it's never explained. What's the point of creating a personality if there's nothing to back it up? I enjoyed him more as the silent type in Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003).

William Malone and John Fasano are the writers behind this. Fasano was probably the man behind all the parts to the film that tried to recollect on what made the original as good as it could be. For all that, it seems like Malone's parts were favored more, which is what made this story so inconsistent. Malone is also the director behind the illogical Creature (1985) film. Just horrendously bad. What's even stranger is that these two writers tried to incorporate comedic lines that are as subtle as the ones of the first. For example, going back to Goldberg, he would be flattened by something and say ""I hate that guy"" in a cartoony way. What made the first movie funny at times was that of how deadpan it was delivered. Here, it just sounds silly.

Mic Rodgers whose real profession is in stunt coordination directed the film. It's also very obvious because this movie contains a lot of action scenes involving stunts so it fits that this would be what he focuses on most. However, this doesn't fix anything. The action is generic and again, cartoonish at times. It's mindless action - nothing complex. Surprisingly for 1999, there aren't many special effects either. Cinematography isn't great either because very little of this movie takes places outside a building, and if it is, it's in the dark. Lastly, Don Davis' score has some quality to it but again, it's nothing that's really memorable considering several times hardcore metal is put in from time to time. Metal is fine but it has to be used in the right manner. This wasn't it and Davis isn't a newbie at composing. He scored the Matrix trilogy!

It's practically nothing like the 1992 original. For a title that supposed to signify the return of greatness - the return is far less than even minimally acceptable.

Coward wrote TEN plays for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, one of which, Star Chamber, was not performed, but NINE one-act plays WERE performed and Joan Collins performs only EIGHT, omitting We Were Dancing. Another reviewer states that this 7-disc collection comprises virtually all Coward's ouevre which is patently ridiculous as, for one thing, all the Revues and Musicals are missing, some of which - Bittersweet, London Calling, This Year of Grace, Words and Music, Operette, Pacific 1860, After The Ball, Ace of Clubs, Sail Away, Conversation Piece, Cavalcade etc - contain some of his most enduring songs, to say nothing of plays like Waiting In The Wings, The Marquise, The Queen Was In The Parlor, Point Valaine, Peace In Our Time, This Happy Breed, South Sea Bubble, Nude With Violin, and more. Bon Voyage is a fine example of the Hollywood 'bomber-crew' film in which a disparate group of people share a confined space - in this case an ocean liner - and we get several stories for the price of one and a dash of happiness and tears, in this case the dramatic death of a character we have come to like and the happy ending to a shipboard romance.

I saw the trailer the other day and was pretty impressed, so I was keen to see the movie. However in the end I feel The Conjuring lacked something. There weren't many scary scenes, even though they were sophisticated. Still, you'll be able to find some scenes when you think ""Really???"". I liked the actors, especially Patrick Wilson's character who looked very reassuring throughout the movie and actually put some confidence in scary scenes. There are some jokes, some ""cool"" scenes, i.e. when they are installing gadgets in the house and some our generation energetic electronic plays in the background. I think they should have concentrated a bit more on a horror part, because especially in the second part of the movie it becomes more like an action/adventure. Overall - a very decent movie that still could have been a bit better. 8/10.",161,0,,0,No reference. The review describes the user's experience and opinions about the movie.

And movies that just to be like other ones usually aren't too good, as case in point.Tobey Marshall is a small time street racer. He and his friend, Pete, make a bet with Dino, whomever wins, gets the whole profit of 2 million dollar car they sold. But, just as Tobey is about to win something goes wrong, and the next thing he knows, he's in jail and Dino gets away.Once Tobey gets out, he encounters the car buyer, Julia, and they are off to California to enter a race in which the winner gets to keep all the cars, which total millions. And it takes a long time before the film ever gets to the big race. I guess the whole car getting lifted by a helicopter was probably the best part.Some things just didn't make sense. Why did Tobey do all the illegal driving when heading off to California? If he would have driven normally, the cops wouldn't have been after him. And for the big race, what is the point in winning all the cars, if all of them are totaled except one. Also, why did they have the finish line in a place where the winner is going to get caught. And come on, in the movie Tobey goes back at the end for Dino, that was out of character considering what Dino did.FINAL VERDICT: If you like fast cars, you'll like it.

217,2599808,2014-01-25,TheLittleSongbird,Valentino (1977),7.0,"Once you realise and accept(if you can) that what is depicted in Valentino is far from what really happened then you will find a lot of enjoyment here. Ken Russell has done better with Women in Love, The Devils and The Music Lovers(also his even better composer documentaries, apart from the Richard Strauss one), it is though certainly more watchable than Lisztomania. The storytelling, told in flashback structure, is jumpy in places which makes it not always easy to follow and I agree that the characters are written flatly, they're very well played but you wish that you learnt more about them. Plus Rudolph Nureyev is a very mixed bag in the title role, he is an incredible dancer(in ballet one of the greats, his chemistry with Margot Fonteyn perhaps unparallelled) and it shows in the beautifully choreographed dance routines, the tango especially, he was also a very handsome man, his chemistry with his colleagues credible and does show some expressive acting in the dances. His dialogue delivery is another story, often very awkward-sounding and at times incomprehensible, and while charismatic and athletic his acting outside the dance routines was at times too subtle and not matching with the acting style of films from the first twenty years of the 20th century. Leslie Caron however looks as though she was having a whale of a time and is gleefully enjoyable, while Michelle Phillips is more restrained and is touching and delightful. Felicity Kendall is also very involved and Carol Kane and Seymour Cassell delight. Ken Russell writes himself in and is thankfully nowhere near as embarrassingly bad as he was in Salome's Last Dance. The music is fitting, it captures the period beautifully and is used in a way that enhances the atmosphere yet accommodates the more dramatic elements. Visually Valentino is a gorgeous film to look at, one of Russell's most visually pleasing films. The sets and colours are lavish and the costumes, hair-styles and make-up are unmistakably 20s. The dance scenes show off Nureyev's talents really well and are intoxicating, while the sexual moments are mostly sexual but sometimes gratuitous. The script is appropriately dark-humoured and sharply biting, you cannot resist how Valentino's conflicts with different people(mainly moguls hungry for power and actresses) are depicted, even if it doesn't say a lot about the characters. Russell like his actors seems to be really enjoying himself, the film is full of his style which goes to go how much the direction shines. And thankfully his stylistic touches while not exactly restrained are not overly-excessive or distasteful, Caron's entrance at the funeral is eye-poppingly operatic, while Valentino's jail encounter, the fight sequence and the staging of the funeral are every bit as entertaining and grandly staged, managing to do so in a way that is not too overblown. In conclusion, not for people expecting a history lesson(and that is not meant to sound derogatory if it does come across that way, more as a forewarning as to what to expect) but for a well-made film that does spark at least an ounce of interest Valentino is worth a viewing. 7/10 Bethany Cox",522,0,,0,"No reference.

During their evening, a heated debate about their relationship is ignited.While Céline calls Jesse's fidelity into question, he challenges her parenting skills, which results in her doubting their love.With its relevant stance on relationship qualms, this second sequel to Before Sunrise serves as an endearing and worthy bookend to the dialogue heavy trilogy that began in 1995.Luckily, thanks to Greece's recession, you can easily get out of the doghouse by buying your wife the Parthenon.

I think what makes the show so engaging is the fact that we have this guy, Dexter, who we become so emotionally and heroically attached to, and we are given a sense and feeling that we want him to prevail and we don't want him to ever be caught or found out who he really is, yet at the same time we sometimes question and doubt the actions that Dexter takes. I believe we as the audience would also find so many similarities in Dexter and his everyday life and at the same time we ask ourselves why Dexter is the way he is, which is another factor as to why he becomes such a successful protagonist.Overall this is a fantastic and thoroughly engaging and addictive TV show, that at times will leave you shocked, disgusted then at other times will leave you happy and relieved for our protagonist, among many other emotions.",217,0,,0,"No reference.

My favorite scene is when the family and Mr.Barrie are flying with the Kite. When Michael gets the Kite up in the air is a magical moment, I always gets tears in my eyes. Maybe it is because you know that he will get it up or the music.

Metaphor: Darren went to the great soda fountain of metaphor and Biblical allegory and he made what some call a ""Suicide"", just a shot of every possible sugary beverage possible, and some cheap booze in a similar varietal. Likely an 8-ball of cocaine to make it seem like a good idea. Then he drank it down quickly (""I wrote the script in just 5 days"" Darren splendors - Oh Really? And I presume you're beyond editorial support at this point in your artistic pinnacle?). He then took his current real-life girlfriend, Jennifer Lawrence, (Jen. Run. You're better than this.) and he strapped some electrodes to her for shock value, and he peed all over her and filmed it using only three shots for some film-school-senior-project level fancy: close up, from behind, and point of view. Then he praised himself for making a film that is 'really about how we are treating mother earth'. Yeah. He did that. And he thinks he's smarter than you.

The whole not-too-subtle story of Artist as God who abuses his muse and is obsessed with praise is heavy handed. You're not a God, Darren.

But, we really know before hand it's about Jason Statham disposing of ""bad guys"". After a slow-ish beginning to setup the Chinese, Russians, and bad cops - and how the little Chinese girl and Statham relate to their Chinatown fiefdom - violence occurs at an extremely fast pace; one could almost call it ""violence porn"" taking into count the visual quantity which, thankfully, spares some of the all too common graphicness. Somehow, the bit of humanity wrapped up in the girl buffers it just the smallest bit as it becomes Stratham's noble vendetta. Statham's fall and rise hinges on this new purpose: to save the little girl. He takes it serious and fights out of the corruption while taking no prisoners.Seen as an action vehicle for Statham this movie fairs a bit better than average as after the slow beginning it moves fast and with masterful fight scenes and a decent enough story. The character of Mei, played by newcomer Catherine Chan, is the standout here: she's a cool professional delivering nuance beyond her age. It's complimented by the usual, but well-casted cops/international bad guy plethora of characters anchored by the steely cold Robert John Burke. Of course, front and center is Statham and he's complicated so as you root for him you still have a sense of dread knowing his character is on the precipice of being beyond redemption due to his circumstances. In other words...A character for Statham with some meat on the bones which he delivers.If you like action it's here and that is the bottom line. A Statham movie where he does his sch-tick well building to a crescendo that is satisfying. There isn't great depth, however, and that is what keeps the movie from rating higher. It's action entertainment that is over-the-top, but doesn't fall apart if you park some of the right-brain matter. I must say that in the times we're now in it becomes harder to appreciate a movie purely based on violent action, but as mentioned earlier in spite of the quantity the graphic level of it isn't pandered.

Bueno, la película puede llegar a ser inferior ya que la historia en uno que otro minuto se traba y no avanza a comparación de sus predecesoras. Lamentablemente la historia tenía mucho más por dar y termina siendo en algún momento algo aburrida. Pero las escenas de acción lo compensan, pero no como para admitir los errores del guión, los cuales en algún que otro momento son notorios.Sin embargo, los efectos visuales están a la altura de todo y los han mejorado de película en película, pero la historia fue disminuyendo en esta tercera parte. No está mal decir que tiene muchas sub-tramas, en la que en algún momento se llegan a entrecruzar pero luego lo explican bien. Pero se sigue notando que no hubo mucha elaboración en el guión, ya que en algún momento los fallos son grandes.Bueno, es una buena recomendación pero lamentablemente no llega a pisarle los talones a la segunda película y mucho menos a la primera. Algo flojo el cierre pero igualmente es aceptable. O eso es para mí.Luego se había empezado a rumorear una cuarta y quinta parte, y me sentía feliz por ello, hasta que dijeron que no habría más secuelas sino un reinicio y yo, como muchos seguidores del hombre araña lo sentimos como un golpe en la cara, o en otro lado.

238,454763,2002-07-04,bob the moo,A View to a Kill (1985),,"When a Soviet silicon chip is stolen by the British it is found to be identical to one being developed by the UK to withstand the effects of a nuclear blast.  They suspect businessman Max Zorin of selling details to them.  When Bond is sent to investigate he finds that Zorin is not only stockpiling silicon but also drilling near the San Andreas fault.  Bond begins to suspect that Zorin does more than just sell secrets.Bond once had a cruel rough edge here that is all but gone with Moore's eye-brow raising technique.  The plot here is of some interest but really it doesn't convince.  The lack of real tension or action takes a lot away from this film and, although it has it's moments, it is really very poor by the high standards of Bond.  However fans of Bond may well like it all the same  I still enjoyed it although I felt that it could have been better.Moore is looking old  his was his last Bond.  He looks too old for this type of thing and it means he's like an aging camp icon in a spy spoof rather than the great Bond as we know him.  Walken is a good bad guy  in other filmshere his natural sinister air gives way to a wildly eccentric villain.  He really should have done what he usually does.  Grace Jones is no Bond girl and really isn't used well.  People like Patrick Macnee and the usual cast add class but really it's only window dressing on a messy film.As with all Bonds this has plenty of nice touches but really this lacks the style and the flair that made the other ones work.  This has some nice effects but really the weaknesses outweigh the strengths.",299,0,,0,"No reference.  The review focuses solely on describing the movie's plot, acting, and overall quality.

239,2772754,2014-12-06,Likes_Ninjas90,出埃及記：天地王者 (2014),4.0,"Ridley Scott's Exodus: Gods and Kings is a grandly staged but soulless and mediocre retelling of Moses liberating the slaves of Egypt. It is one of two Bible films released in 2014, following Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which envisioned a corrupt world cleansed of evil by a violent God and where a single man was enlisted to salvage a group of people. This description is applicable to Exodus given the over familiarity of its plotting and characters. The return of these Biblical epics is not only because Hollywood is heavily influenced by Christian values and religious groups in the industry. The popularisation of epics in the vein of Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments and William Wyler's Ben Hur is also political. Currently, violence and extremism are perpetuated by radical fundamentalists misinterpreting religion. Bible stories are as current as they are ancient, relaying the Old Testament's brutality and reflecting perpetually violent attitudes of modern extremists.While Aronofsky's film gambled on bleak, moody stylisation, Exodus' treatment is safe and unsurprising, adhering to a fault to past filmmaking traditions. Prior to the film's release, an online boycott was launched, attacking the decision to cast White actors in major roles of Middle Eastern characters. White imitation, where Anglo- Saxon actors impersonate ethnic roles, is an unproud, archaic Hollywood practice. Ridley Scott defended the casting in a Variety interview: ""I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain, and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such."" His insensitivity doesn't account for how White actors today would be forbidden from playing a Black character, particularly in America. Similarly, given Hollywood's oversaturated marketing budgets, would it be too difficult to sell the film on Scott's name alone or introduce new actors to the world?Casting recognisable stars detracts sharply from the film's period rendering. Featuring Englishmen Christian Bale and Ben Kingsley, Americans Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro and Aaron Paul and Australians Ben Mendelsohn and Joel Edgerton, there's a wave of familiar faces and accents jarring with the setting and typifying the film's homogenisation. Rarely does an image, a line of dialogue, or character feel unique to the film either. The opening quarter particularly mimics Scott's Gladiator too closely. Moses (Bale) is a more skillful warrior and tactician than his half brother Ramses (Edgerton). He saves Ramses life in an early battle scene and Ramses' father Seti (John Turturro) seems to favour him more even though he is adopted and unlikely to become the next Pharaoh. After investigating the thieving shonky practices of Hegep (Mendelsohn), Moses's true Hebrew heritage is explained to him by Nun (Ben Kingsley). Hegep reveals this to Ramses, who forces Moses into exile. Moses starts a family of his own in a village, with a wife and son. After hitting his head he is plagued by visions of God inhabiting the body of a young boy (Isaac Andrews), who encourages him to free the Hebrews from enslavement. His fate of being exiled, his goal and motives are highly similar to Maximus.Bale's inclusion accentuates the derivativeness of the archetype. Instead of a cape and a mask, Moses wields a gold sword. But like Bruce Wayne, Moses's arc is typical of Hollywood characters searching for individualism. He predictably transitions from denying his legacy to liberating his people and reuniting himself with his family. The script rewritten by Steve Zaillian from Bill Collage and Adam Cooper's drafts takes Moses through unnecessary detours. Ramses only considers killing Moses long after he's exiled and a training montage where Moses teaches soldiers to fight is wasted when God unleashes the plagues instead. Moses becomes displaced from the story, except for a tangent where he disapproves of God's methods of justice. The plagues of Egypt are admittedly disturbing and visceral, but the literal interpretation diminishes possibilities of Moses imagining God. One unsettling dramatic touch is cutting to Ramses' family life before the plagues, which builds tension knowing his son's fate. But Ramses isn't a juicy villain but a weak symbol of hubris. Joel Edgerton doesn't have a firm grasp on what angle to take, meaning we don't entirely feel the emotion of his blindness and rage.Once Exodus escapes its stifled first half, the rest of narrative from the plagues onwards is overly familiar, bloody and brutal and supplies the actors with predictable, punchline dialogue spoken in plain English. There was a chance here to touch upon refugees escaping war and enslavement. These are issues dramatised only through the rhythms of action set pieces. While Scott's Robin Hood cut a new origin story into an old tale and reinvented the characters, there are fewer surprises about how this film develops because of how risk-averse it is with the narrative and the casting. While the scale of the film is huge and cinematic, it's the finer attention to detail in the screenplay and the period which feel lacking. Imagination and distinction are not qualities one would expect missing from the director who made Alien and Blade Runner. But in his twilight year Ridley Scott is determined largely to make epics of numbers rather than people.",852,0,,0,"No reference to other reviews.

The drunken eccentric, Sir Henry 'me-blikin-Rawlin-sunshine' who passes his time drinking excessively, shooting everything that moves, thwarting escapes from his very own POW camp and reliving the bombing of Dresden is played exquisitely by Trevor Howard in an absolute 'tour de force' performance which is undoubtedly one of Howards best. Howard is ably supported by a pot-pourri of classic 'English' comedy actors including Denise Coffey, playing Mrs E, who had previously worked with Stanshall on the classic 60's TV series 'Do Not Adjust Your Set'. In 1980 Sir Henry played out of festival at Cannes to general bafflement. Stanshall described it as a sur-Ealing comedy, a fitting description indeed.Worth watching again and again",145,0,,0,No reference.

241,880959,2005-01-08,bzzzbee,The Incredibles (2004),,"You see the trailers, view the making of special and it still delivers?! What a terrific movie and a rarity these days, unless it is a Pixar initiative. While it seems to borrow the dual identity premise of Spy Kids (2001), the large variety of wacky superheroes like Mystery Men (1999), the reworked superpowers of The Fantastic Four, the excitement and energy of the best James Bond movies and the character fallibilities of Spider-man 2 (2004) it is largely a unique movie in its own right.It is fundamentally an action movie but what sets Pixar movies apart, from not only other animated but standard flicks, is the humanity it imparts. There are elements similar to the Iron Giant (1999), also directed by Mr Bird, that are very touching. The characters have depth and by the end of it most viewers will have something they can take away from the experience. A bit like an Aesop's fable using outstanding animation.This isn't a by-the-numbers movie where the film-makers left all their great work on a white board. These people obviously care deeply about the project, the story and the characters. This makes it easy for the viewer to feel compassion and sympathy for 'The Incredibles' and strongly dislike the villain. While the animated special effects are, dare I say it, INCREDIBLE, this movie has heart and any effects used have a purpose that enhances the story.There is also a great sense of comedy. Some of the scenes featuring the parents in various situations had me laughing out loud. Like all the other Pixar movies there is plenty of fun for the adults. Not so many in-jokes as the Toy Story movies as this movie stands strongly by itself with its own style. Mr Incredible's ever increasing paunch is something I can really relate to. Whatever happened to the glory days when I could feel my ribs! I'm going to see this again. The movie reinforces the importance of family, to treat others as you'd treat yourself and don't take life for granted. In times of war and crippling natural disasters these messages couldn't come at a better time. Yet it avoids preaching to the audience and being overly overt in delivering its messages.It is perfect for parents who want to do something entertaining with their kids or for people like me in their early-30s who appreciate good film making, a nice chocolate ice-cream/box of popcorn and laughing together with complete strangers.",409,0,,0,No reference.

I enjoyed both movies quite a lot, but I'd have to say that although Hulk vs. Wolverine makes ""more sense"" if you know all the characters, Hulk vs. Thor was just a more enjoyable ride for me. For those who've watched, I have to wonder if they caught the glaringly-nonsensical ending on vs. Thor. Bruce had refused to help Thor, was forced to by Hela, and then his job was to stand in one spot so that he and the Hulk would come into contact. I hardly think that Odin's speech of ""Today a mortal showed the gods what legends are made of"" is fitting for so little. It was great watching Wolverine duke it out with the Hulk like only he can.

I am still surprised at the type of fan fare it is getting though with many people giving it a ten and saying it's the best live action spiderman they've ever seen. I wouldn't go that far to giving it credit. What it does well is follow up Endgame very well and tells a whole new story. It also manages to bring the underlying story of Spiderman to the big screen and that is a kid with superhero powers trying to balance that with being a teenager and falling in love and school and friends etc. This manages to capture that very well considering it's all about monsters and aliens and destruction. The CGI battles are plenty and the CGI is quite well done but there is a lot of it. It was nice to have some of the younger people playing supporting cast members like Zendaya (who actually makes a very good, layered MJ) , Jacob Batalon and Angourie Rice. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a decent villain as the bizarre Mysterio. He sort of overplays it, a little campy at times but it works for the most part. I didn't think his chemistry with Tom Holland was all that great but it was still good to see a new villain on the big screen. Speaking of chemistry, I think Tom Holland and Zendaya are actually great together and I wasn't sure how she would fare as Mary Jane but the two of them are quite good together. This is a great summer flick, exactly what you would expect, shows the Marvel Universe has more to offer and it's a lot of fun. 8/10",284,1,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

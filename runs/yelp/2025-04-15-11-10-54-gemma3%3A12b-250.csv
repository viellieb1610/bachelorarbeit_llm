I think they put an entire basil plant on each pizza, but I had no complaints. Basically, was the pizza amazing? Yes. I'd say it's on par with the best I've had, but good lord--that wait?

I don't know why but you Manhattanites somehow love that combination (ie crappy food, nice decor, and an overpriced menu). As a general rule, you can tell an Asian restaurant has terrible food and is just trying to sell you an image (and not the quality of their food) when you see one or more of the below: 1) Hip, trendy music playing at the restaurant. 2) No (or very few) Asian patrons. Maybe one of two who are just mostly hanging out with their unfortunate non-Asian friends who are about to get ripped off with overpriced and mediocre food, but no groups of Asians (and come on, guys. This is a dead give away. If you haven't figure this one out already then god help you. As a general rule we Asians have a better idea where good Asian food is so you might want to follow us on this one instead of Tom and Dick from Ohio). 3) Food served on over-sized square plates. 4) Over-the-top Buddhism/Hinduism decor. 5) Strong smell of garlic (chef can't cook so he drenched everything in garlic, oil, and MSG and just fried it). For better and authentic Thai food try Jaiya (was there many yrs ago not sure how good they are now) or that little Thai restaurant in Woodside, Queens (right off the 7 train line). Totally forgot the name. Think it starts with an ""S"". Or befriend someone from Thailand and ask them where they go to get good Thai food.

I also ordered a falafel appetizer, 5 perfectly cooked falafel balls with some hummus to dip them in. These were the second best falafel balls I&#39;ve ever had. Fried to a crispy golden brown with a moist and delicious inside. I also ordered their Mediterranean beer. My wife ordered the Lamb Shish. Pieces of lamb, marinated in sauce and grilled it was served with rice and house salad. I tried the lamb it was flavorful and tender. My sister in law had the Adana Kebab, chopped lamb with red bell peppers, seasoned and grilled on skewer, served with rice and a house salad. She said it was very good and took some leftovers home. My brother in law had the Iskender Kebab. Doner kebab served over fried pide bread topped with a fresh tomato sauce, yogurt on the side. He liked it, said it had a kick to the sauce.

The noodles are slightly thinner than other places and was cooked just right: soft and chewy. The beef was fresh. But my only complaint is the soup, thus why I gave Pho Grand 3 stars. Two important qualities of pho beef soup to me is 1: how hot the broth is 2: how long it lasts in my tongue and carries through with the noodle. The broth was not hot enough to slightly cook my bean sprouts and beef. My broth turned pinkish because of the raw beef, but the beef didn't cook a little more, it was basically a disc of pink meat. While some people prefer this, I don't, because pho is not steak carpaccio on top of noodles. Also, the depth of flavor in the soup was short-lived. When the soup first entered my moth, it was mellow beef, great but soon after, there was no substantial taste. Eating the soup along with the noodle almost felt like the soup was whispering ""help!

The fried dates were delicious--sweet dates with savory fried battered (comes in an order of four so perfect for sharing). Shrimp chips came with a shrimp paste that slightly numbs the mouth (Sichuan style). There's probably not enough chips for all the paste and the chips themselves weren't as crispy as I would have hoped. But I really liked the shrimp paste. Pork belly egg rolls were probably my favorite of the night. It was two rolls with chunks of pork belly and fried in a batter so extra fried. The black bean noodles were surprisingly great. Not an overwhelming black bean flavor/sauce--simple scattering of black beans. Also had slices of meat to add a little extra flavor to the noodles. The other dishes were too exciting. The oysters were good but not in their shell so the appetizer looked extremely small and underwhelming. They had a savory flavor but not much else. The pork chops were too salty in my opinion.

To lay it out like this: maybe if you're on a casual, low-key date, and you're with a girl who would be interested and open to trying something exotic, this would be perfect.  Otherwise, there's plenty of McDonalds in the Bronx too, I guess.  While this was the first time in about 8 years that I have been back in the Bronx, I'd say that it was a trip well worth it and I would say that this place made this weekend trip to New York City worthwhile...and it was only Saturday afternoon.",370,0,0,"No reference.

The owner was rude to our party of 4 on two occasions, and we waited about 15 minutes to be approached by our server. Once we did order, we received our appetizers after 15 minutes, and our beer after 20 minutes. The only part I actually enjoyed was the fact the the patty of the burger was indeed of high quality. Long version: 1) The restaurant is divided into two sections (seems like two neighboring establishments combined into one). The second room is fully open with a view on the street. We saw a couple of tables available, and went to the entrance of the restaurant to try and grab a seat. We were greeted by the owner, who told us it's not possible to get a table in the second room because he has a large party. We decided to leave (because we didn't like the atmosphere in the first room) , and momentarily were chased down by one of the servers telling us he found us a table. As we entered the second room, we realized that the owner was dishonest about the seat availability, as well as the fact that there wasn't a single party, but different groups of people.   2) The second problem was the long wait time I've mentioned in the short version. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to prepare a pitcher of beer.   3) One of the members of our party attempted to find the restroom. It's located in the area between the two rooms, where the kitchen is located; It's a bit confusing. As she was standing there the owner approached her and asked her what she was looking for. She told him she was looking for the restroom, to which he responded ""you shouldn't look for the bathroom, and you should have walked in through the main entrance"". I understand that maybe he thought she came off the street to use the restroom, but if you have a terrible field vision within the vicinity of your own business, maybe you should not automatically assume that your PAYING CUSTOMER who's been sitting in your establishment for close to an hour is someone off the street.",376,0,0,No reference. # The review solely describes the user's experience and doesn't mention or refer to other reviews or the review platform itself.

While it's not the cheapest sandwich, it's absolutely reasonable for the quality of ingredients you're getting. The texture and pops of little roe eggs really knock the sandwich to another planet. However, the bagel for me was extremely mediocre. Dry, bready, and lacking in crust and chewy texture. I had a piece of herring for $3-4, which was really salty, but delicious like sushi. I would recommend eating it on bread or a cracker with cream sauce, anything to knock the saltiness down. This seems like a take out place though. I would buy bagels separately from place and then pick out your ingredients for sandwich making. I'm sure buying them individually is cheaper and gives you more food for sandwich making.

I am SO happy we ordered from them though! Some of the best food I have gotten off Seamless my whole summer in NYC! First off, the food arrived within the time they estimated & on top of that, the packaging was the best I've seen. It was completely organized in the most efficient way & everything was set up so neat & the food was burning hot & fresh. I hate getting food delivered when everything is spilled, slimy, cold, or shoved in a bag with a drink leaking everywhere. It instantly makes me wanna not eat it. But this food was packaged and organized perfectly. The food itself was amazing. I got the Penne Alla Vodka & my friend got the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes. My other friend got the appetizer sampler which included chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, & potato skins. I tried the pasta obviously & the appetizer sampler & they were both delicious. The pasta was cooked well & there was the perfect amount of really flavorful sauce. The food in the appetizer tray was still crispy & crunchy & everything tasted amazing & I don't even really like chicken wings. I didn't try the salmon but it looked really good.

We got a healthy ( not meaning its good for you) cross section of their offerings. everything was amazing. 4 stars for food, hands down.

Double wrapped corn tortillas, sprinkle of onions, cilantro and a couple of limes to squeeze onto each. Simply a mouth watering experience. Fresh, clean, bursting with the complicated goodness that a taco provides by mingling the protein of the meat with the burst of onion scent, the aromatics of the cilantro, the citrus burn from the lime, a touch of sauce.

Sure, they got our appetizer wrong, brought out my friend's appetizer (which she wanted as a meal) before they brought our shared appetizer (which came out frozen) and made my other friend's tofu look like seared chicken.** But on Yelp, you're defined by the bathroom.*** See through doors, sliding doors and frosted glass are all staples of reviews here. And what did I notice after finishing my business at Spice? No sink. Now, I'm pretty sure that I've missed something at this point. Last I checked, it was pretty necessary for a restaurant to have a sink in their bathroom; apparently the health department frowns on not having one. Sure, it's fine**** if I don't wash my hands ... the only meal I'm infecting is my own*****. But if a cook does that, it's a problem right? So after a few seconds of turning myself right 'round in the six-by-six space, I opened the door and went outside, ostensibly to figure out where they had misplaced their sink. Apparently they keep it outside the bathroom, where both men, women, children and cooks can all use the same one sink. A line of people washing their hands all up in the middle of everyone eating dinner? That doesn't seem like a good idea. My pad thai was fine, but two pieces of shrimp in the whole deal? Overall I'm unimpressed. Maybe this place is fine for take-out, but for dining in, it's a place I'll skip from now on. * - My mother likes to talk about bathrooms, too. But more about crown moldings and colors and whydon'tyouhaveanycleantowels and other things I kind of like to avoid. ** - I would usually think of this as kind of an improvement, but apparently vegetarians don't feel the same way. *** - Not that I have any idea why. **** - Not really. ***** - And that one time with that girl I went out with once, but that really wasn't my fault.",348,1,1,"Reference to other reviews # The review explicitly mentions ""Yelp"" and refers to a defining characteristic of reviews (""on Yelp, you're defined by the bathroom"")."

To start off, the deals that they are promoting on social media  is definitely false advertisement. The post on Instagram states the game/ karaoke night starts at 8:30pm. That was a lie, the event started at 10:30pm. Then the post stated they have 2 for 1 drinks, which was also a lie. I brought 2 for 1 rum punch that is on the menu for 12 dollars. When we received the bill we were charged 14 dollars for the drink. When I mentioned the error, the waiter said the deal is not 2 for 1 its 2 for $14 and refused to change it.

They certainly don't skimp on the portions. But who cares about quantity when it all tastes like warmed over crap? When I walked in, I should have been greeted with the mouthwatering smell of grilling poultry and meats. Instead, my nostrils were hit with disinfectant and grease. Grilled chicken is their specialty, but I opted for a half rack of barbecue ribs with beans and rice and mac and cheese for the sides. The ribs were just ok. There was plenty of meat on them, but there was also gristle and it was a little dry. The barbecue sauce helped moisten things up a bit.  Fred Flintstone would have been proud, but it was nothing to write home about. The sides were a horror - communion wafers would have had more flavor than this slop.  How can beans and rice or Mac and cheese be devoid of any flavor?  I don't know, you have to ask the cook. The sides are laid out cafeteria style in warming trays and it looked like they were cooking for days on end, turning into steaming, flavorless globs of their former selves.  Of course, none of it looked appetizing behind the greasy counter glass and the worn out tray covers. Also unsettling is the number of religious imagery in the store.  There was a huge, really tawdry shrine right on top of the soda fridge and a large crucifix looming over the dining tables.  There was also a really cheesy last supper scene laid out in metal relief.

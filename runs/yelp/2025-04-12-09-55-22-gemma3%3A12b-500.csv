I think my roommates may punch me for only giving them 4 stars, but I just can't justify giving them 5 stars with the wait time + the prices. This pizza is truly superb and absolutely delicious. The hostess didn't have much in the way of a positive attitude, but our servers were wonderful. We put our names in around 6pm and were told to come back at 10. We did, and ended up waiting another half hour before being seated. We ordered two pizzas--one with mushrooms, half pepper and half pepperoni, and the other was a basic margarita with shallots. The total for that? $58. With tip, I think we ended up spending about $70. Two pizzas at $29 each. I'm going to let that sink in. It's a lot! I think they put an entire basil plant on each pizza, but I had no complaints. Basically, was the pizza amazing? Yes. I'd say it's on par with the best I've had, but good lord--that wait? I don't think it justified a 4+ hour wait. I waited for 2 hours for Battersby on a weekend, and that was worth it. To wait twice as long, this would have to be, comparatively, twice as good.

I am of the opinion that if you never traveled to a foreign country and tasted their food, you really shouldn't share your views on Yelp. You guys are just skewing the ratings system. Really, the food here is at best mediocre. Service, well, they managed to screw up my order every time I go. So at least they are consistent. I know, there are so many garbage Asian ""restaurants"" in Manhattan it is hard for those who has never been to Asia to tell the good ones from the bad. So I am going to help you guys out a bit since so many of you can't tell the difference between good and bad Asian food. Often, these restaurants' food has the same quality as McDonald's, but these ""restaurants"" have better furniture and are much more overpriced. I don't know why but you Manhattanites somehow love that combination (ie crappy food, nice decor, and an overpriced menu). As a general rule, you can tell an Asian restaurant has terrible food and is just trying to sell you an image (and not the quality of their food) when you see one or more of the below: 1) Hip, trendy music playing at the restaurant. 2) No (or very few) Asian patrons. Maybe one of two who are just mostly hanging out with their unfortunate non-Asian friends who are about to get ripped off with overpriced and mediocre food, but no groups of Asians (and come on, guys. This is a dead give away. If you haven't figure this one out already then god help you. As a general rule we Asians have a better idea where good Asian food is so you might want to follow us on this one instead of Tom and Dick from Ohio). 3) Food served on over-sized square plates. 4) Over-the-top Buddhism/Hinduism decor. 5) Strong smell of garlic (chef can't cook so he drenched everything in garlic, oil, and MSG and just fried it). For better and authentic Thai food try Jaiya (was there many yrs ago not sure how good they are now) or that little Thai restaurant in Woodside, Queens (right off the 7 train line). Totally forgot the name. Think it starts with an ""S"". Or befriend someone from Thailand and ask them where they go to get good Thai food. And stop messing up Yelp's rating system.",434,1,0,gave more than 2 stars,ja,1,"Reference to other reviews.

After a search on Yelp exploring the options in the area we decided to try the Mediterranean cooking at Galata two blocks away. The restaurant had a warm feel about it. Like being in Turkey. They brought us some very tasty Mediterranean bread. It had a  chewy crust and a soft inside, perfect for sopping up the hummus and eggplant appetizers that we had ordered. We also ordered Cigar Rolls / Sigara Boregi. Cigar-shaped pastry stuffed with cheese and parsley that also had a delicious dipping sauce.<br>I didn&#39;t want a heavy meat meal so I opted for two appetizers as my meal. I ordered the Grilled Calamari / Kalamar Izgara. Tender pieces of char-grilled calamari, seasoned with garlic, tarragon and parsley, served with a house salad the tarragon dressing for the calamari was very good as was the salad. I also ordered a falafel appetizer, 5 perfectly cooked falafel balls with some hummus to dip them in. These were the second best falafel balls I&#39;ve ever had. Fried to a crispy golden brown with a moist and delicious inside. I also ordered their Mediterranean beer. My wife ordered the Lamb Shish. Pieces of lamb, marinated in sauce and grilled it was served with rice and house salad. I tried the lamb it was flavorful and tender. My sister in law had the Adana Kebab, chopped lamb with red bell peppers, seasoned and grilled on skewer, served with rice and a house salad. She said it was very good and took some leftovers home. My brother in law had the Iskender Kebab. Doner kebab served over fried pide bread topped with a fresh tomato sauce, yogurt on the side. He liked it, said it had a kick to the sauce.

As for deliveries, the two times I've ordered, the food took over 50 minutes to arrive (I live about 3 blocks away) and the burgers were cold, amazingly undersized, and the shakes were essentially soup by that point.

I got #2, small - pho with fresh eye round, tendons and other items (I don't remember). The noodles and the fresh eye round was fabulous. The noodles are slightly thinner than other places and was cooked just right: soft and chewy. The beef was fresh. But my only complaint is the soup, thus why I gave Pho Grand 3 stars. Two important qualities of pho beef soup to me is 1: how hot the broth is 2: how long it lasts in my tongue and carries through with the noodle. The broth was not hot enough to slightly cook my bean sprouts and beef. My broth turned pinkish because of the raw beef, but the beef didn't cook a little more, it was basically a disc of pink meat. While some people prefer this, I don't, because pho is not steak carpaccio on top of noodles. Also, the depth of flavor in the soup was short-lived. When the soup first entered my moth, it was mellow beef, great but soon after, there was no substantial taste. Eating the soup along with the noodle almost felt like the soup was whispering ""help!

I went to Fung Tu under the recommendation of a friend. The menu looked delicious and who can deny Asian Fusion. I made a reservation through Yelp and didn't have any problems. I was actually able to make an earlier reservation due to a last minute cancellation. Service was fine--filled my water and took my plates. As with most restaurants getting the check was slow. Here's the run down of the meal: oysters, fried dates, pork belly egg rolls, shrimp chips with Sichuan shrimp, fried rice, black bean noodles, and pork chops Here's what I'd order again: fried dates, shrimp chips, pork belly egg rolls, and black bean noodles. The fried dates were delicious--sweet dates with savory fried battered (comes in an order of four so perfect for sharing). Shrimp chips came with a shrimp paste that slightly numbs the mouth (Sichuan style). There's probably not enough chips for all the paste and the chips themselves weren't as crispy as I would have hoped. But I really liked the shrimp paste. Pork belly egg rolls were probably my favorite of the night. It was two rolls with chunks of pork belly and fried in a batter so extra fried. The black bean noodles were surprisingly great. Not an overwhelming black bean flavor/sauce--simple scattering of black beans. Also had slices of meat to add a little extra flavor to the noodles. The other dishes were too exciting. The oysters were good but not in their shell so the appetizer looked extremely small and underwhelming. They had a savory flavor but not much else. The pork chops were too salty in my opinion.

The best way to sum this up, is that those who are searching for the exotic, should definitely come here.  They don't have a printed menu, but you can simply point to the different things you can choose to eat.  I had a mixture of yellow rice, chicken/beef and cow foot, all food that we also eat in Trinidad, where my parents are from.  However, I don't regularly eat cow's foot, so this was a rather exotic experience for myself as well.  It was definitely interesting and though I can't say I would have it regularly, it's not as bad as you might imagine. To lay it out like this: maybe if you're on a casual, low-key date, and you're with a girl who would be interested and open to trying something exotic, this would be perfect.  Otherwise, there's plenty of McDonalds in the Bronx too, I guess.  While this was the first time in about 8 years that I have been back in the Bronx, I'd say that it was a trip well worth it and I would say that this place made this weekend trip to New York City worthwhile...and it was only Saturday afternoon.",370,0,0,,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

The owner was rude to our party of 4 on two occasions, and we waited about 15 minutes to be approached by our server. Once we did order, we received our appetizers after 15 minutes, and our beer after 20 minutes. The only part I actually enjoyed was the fact the the patty of the burger was indeed of high quality. Long version: 1) The restaurant is divided into two sections (seems like two neighboring establishments combined into one). The second room is fully open with a view on the street. We saw a couple of tables available, and went to the entrance of the restaurant to try and grab a seat. We were greeted by the owner, who told us it's not possible to get a table in the second room because he has a large party. We decided to leave (because we didn't like the atmosphere in the first room) , and momentarily were chased down by one of the servers telling us he found us a table. As we entered the second room, we realized that the owner was dishonest about the seat availability, as well as the fact that there wasn't a single party, but different groups of people.   2) The second problem was the long wait time I've mentioned in the short version. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to prepare a pitcher of beer.   3) One of the members of our party attempted to find the restroom. It's located in the area between the two rooms, where the kitchen is located; It's a bit confusing. As she was standing there the owner approached her and asked her what she was looking for. She told him she was looking for the restroom, to which he responded ""you shouldn't look for the bathroom, and you should have walked in through the main entrance"". I understand that maybe he thought she came off the street to use the restroom, but if you have a terrible field vision within the vicinity of your own business, maybe you should not automatically assume that your PAYING CUSTOMER who's been sitting in your establishment for close to an hour is someone off the street.",376,0,0,,,0,"No reference.

I would buy bagels separately from place and then pick out your ingredients for sandwich making. I'm sure buying them individually is cheaper and gives you more food for sandwich making.

It was completely organized in the most efficient way & everything was set up so neat & the food was burning hot & fresh. I hate getting food delivered when everything is spilled, slimy, cold, or shoved in a bag with a drink leaking everywhere. It instantly makes me wanna not eat it. But this food was packaged and organized perfectly. The food itself was amazing. I got the Penne Alla Vodka & my friend got the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes. My other friend got the appetizer sampler which included chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, & potato skins. I tried the pasta obviously & the appetizer sampler & they were both delicious. The pasta was cooked well & there was the perfect amount of really flavorful sauce. The food in the appetizer tray was still crispy & crunchy & everything tasted amazing & I don't even really like chicken wings. I didn't try the salmon but it looked really good.

Yea, sure, I do it plenty, but I took a chance here and absolutely scored. Little risk, really. There are *so* many good eateries within a few blocks of here that if you aren't good you're gonna get your butt handed to you on a platter. Three tacos to go, eaten standing up (Tip: spread your legs wide). Pollo with a splash of avocado, carnitas and beef. Double wrapped corn tortillas, sprinkle of onions, cilantro and a couple of limes to squeeze onto each. Simply a mouth watering experience. Fresh, clean, bursting with the complicated goodness that a taco provides by mingling the protein of the meat with the burst of onion scent, the aromatics of the cilantro, the citrus burn from the lime, a touch of sauce. A match made in heaven. Finishing the last bite I wiped my fingers on the single napkin provided, dumped the sack into the trash and slung my bag over my shoulder and headed to the bus that would take me to La Guardia.

Sure, they got our appetizer wrong, brought out my friend's appetizer (which she wanted as a meal) before they brought our shared appetizer (which came out frozen) and made my other friend's tofu look like seared chicken.** But on Yelp, you're defined by the bathroom.*** See through doors, sliding doors and frosted glass are all staples of reviews here. And what did I notice after finishing my business at Spice? No sink. Now, I'm pretty sure that I've missed something at this point. Last I checked, it was pretty necessary for a restaurant to have a sink in their bathroom; apparently the health department frowns on not having one. Sure, it's fine**** if I don't wash my hands ... the only meal I'm infecting is my own*****. But if a cook does that, it's a problem right? So after a few seconds of turning myself right 'round in the six-by-six space, I opened the door and went outside, ostensibly to figure out where they had misplaced their sink. Apparently they keep it outside the bathroom, where both men, women, children and cooks can all use the same one sink. A line of people washing their hands all up in the middle of everyone eating dinner? That doesn't seem like a good idea. My pad thai was fine, but two pieces of shrimp in the whole deal? Overall I'm unimpressed. Maybe this place is fine for take-out, but for dining in, it's a place I'll skip from now on. * - My mother likes to talk about bathrooms, too.

They certainly don't skimp on the portions. But who cares about quantity when it all tastes like warmed over crap? When I walked in, I should have been greeted with the mouthwatering smell of grilling poultry and meats. Instead, my nostrils were hit with disinfectant and grease. Grilled chicken is their specialty, but I opted for a half rack of barbecue ribs with beans and rice and mac and cheese for the sides. The ribs were just ok. There was plenty of meat on them, but there was also gristle and it was a little dry. The barbecue sauce helped moisten things up a bit.  Fred Flintstone would have been proud, but it was nothing to write home about. The sides were a horror - communion wafers would have had more flavor than this slop.  How can beans and rice or Mac and cheese be devoid of any flavor?  I don't know, you have to ask the cook. The sides are laid out cafeteria style in warming trays and it looked like they were cooking for days on end, turning into steaming, flavorless globs of their former selves.  Of course, none of it looked appetizing behind the greasy counter glass and the worn out tray covers. Also unsettling is the number of religious imagery in the store.  There was a huge, really tawdry shrine right on top of the soda fridge and a large crucifix looming over the dining tables.  There was also a really cheesy last supper scene laid out in metal relief.

The great thing about this place is that it is open late everyday and makes some delicious drinks and Asian inspired desserts like their famous Korean ho-dduk, which was what they sold in the beginning of their story. Now they serve it with a dose of ice cream and cinnamon syrup. They make shaved ice desserts as well and all sorts of milk tea and espresso drinks. I also like the fact that they have a lot of table space but can get packed all times of the day from locals to tourists checking out the one street of Korean businesses.

It was definitely lacking in cheesiness and overall amount (for the price), but the taste was average. I've definitely had better ddukbokki in K-town. The beef bibimbap was also disappointing because they had cooked the egg yolk entirely and make egg strips out of it. I don't know how Koreans eat their bibimbap, but having the egg yolk on top is my favorite part of this dish because I can then poke it and have it mix into my dish. The taste was also average.

We ordered the uni pasta, lobster roll, and cb mussels.  I think cb stands for Cutting Board.  The Uni pasta didn't taste the way I expect it to taste, it's not a bad thing actually.  I uni sauce is very creamy, almost like a vodka sauce and has a subtle uni taste.  It's very heavy and could use a bit of cool crunchy element to balance the pasta.  The lobster roll was a bit disappointing.  There was actually very little lobster and was very salty.  The mayo sauce with the lobster almost tasted like a tuna fish type.  For $9, I think I'd rather pay a little more and get it from Luke's Lobster.  The mussels were surprisingly very tasty.  I was really expecting dried out, flavorless, itty bitty mussels.  It's cooked with saffron and sake and you can really taste it.  It's a subtle sake taste but enough to give you a nice aroma.   The front of the restaurant seems a bit small but they have a larger dining room in the back, good for parties.  The kitchen is in the front with a glass wall and customers can watch the chefs work their magic.  Hole in the walls like these with this kind of setting is the best!  You can make sure the chefs methods of cooking is all ""kosher"".  :)  The bathroom is also very clean and you can't help but stay in there for an extra minute or two to admire the wall decals.   Of course, a restaurant with good food and terrible service isn't a restaurant at all.  BUT, this place has friendly and fast service.  A small operation but our waiter and server was great.  Something you don't really find in a small place in chinatown.  I am definitely a fan but if Cutting Board is reading this, please change up your lobster roll a bit.  It leaves MUCH to desire.",405,1,0,schwierig,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

On a pretty dingy block under the 7 train, it is a quaint and friendly place for lunch, dinner and especially breakfast. It's some kind of Mexican fusion restaraunt/bakery. The Mexican part is obvious, tacos, tortas quesedillas...but these are usually somewhat fancied up, for instance the Shrimp Quesedilla is amazing, a huge mound of tortilla, shrimp, potatoes, cheese, different salsas and god knows what else. But they also have all kinds of sandwhiches, wraps, pizza, salads etc. I haven't tried that much but I assume it's all good!

The tortas are unique and great as well, the ""La Flor"" is a bbq pork sandwhich that I'd recommend. Deserts are recommended as well, chocolate bread heated up in the oven is amazing. And the hot chocolate, which they describe as a mix between mexican hot chocolate and the standard, was great. UPDATE: While having countless lunches and brunches there, I'd only been for dinner once before, on valentines day. Went back tonight (a friday) for the second time. I had the BBQ Ribs.

So many reviewers said they made it well here. Nope. There were only 4 of us and the waiter was pushing us to order 2 lobsters. We only ordered one and when he brought the dish out, he had 2 on the platter and said they made a mistake and asked if we wanted both. It wasn't great either, lobster didn't have much flavor and did not taste fresh. Would have thought the double order was a simple mistake but when we were trying to order a veg, he kept asking that if they didn't have snow pea tips, would we want water spinach? We said yes and discussed how we wanted it cooked. My MIL was asking if they had a 3-egg version and if one of the eggs was salted egg. He was giving her a hard time explaining it, acting like he didn't know what salted egg was. He then went into the kitchen to ask. When he came out, he said no, but then he never checked to see if they had snow pea tips, which is what we really wanted from the beginning. When we queried about that, he insisted we had decided on water spinach. After arguing with him this much already, we were like, fine, just bring us the damn water spinach. It was terrible - old, tough, a pallid green color. And then I noticed almost everyone had it on their table. Obviously they were pushing it to get rid of it.

Once we arrived, there was only 8 of us so they would not seat us until the other 2 arrived. Turns out it wouldn't have mattered anyway as the tables which were ours were still taken, even 45 minutes after 8. By the time we were about to sit, they tell us that there is only 1lb of meat left.

We were pissed and stormed out, walking down the street to Fette Sau instead. What was the point of a reservation if we couldn't order any brisket, and we couldn't get a table at our reservation time? If you are a reader who pays attention, you should be questioning why I gave this place a 5-star review, despite all that happened. Well, my buddy who made the reservation sent an email to the owner telling him what happened, telling him that it was a big time fail and an epic embarrassment for him and my birthday party plans. The owner responded with an actual paper card with a handwritten apology, and a gift card on it. Epic customer service + apology + acknowledgment that you were in the wrong = excellent review and repeat customers.

I have really high expectations for Italian cuisine because I love it so much. I was excited to try their food but it didn't live up to my expectations. Their menu didn't leave me with a lot of options but I kind of like that, it means they specialize on the selected items on their menu so you can't really go wrong with what you order. I was wrong though. The light battered Calamari was served with long hot peppers that tasted just like Shishito peppers. The baked clams was a total miss. The Linguine with clams was off, not sure what it was, maybe the spring onion? I typically do not get spring onion on my linguine with clam. The fusilli was bland, I couldn't bare to eat more than a couple of pieces. There was nothing really interesting to say about it. The Chicken Parm sandwich was quite difficult to tackle. i don't like bread, but i had hopes that maybe this sandwich would be the best choice but nope. I saved room for dessert and ordered the classic ice cream cake slice and for a whooping $12 for a thin slice that tasted so ordinary, I much rather buy some better quality ice-cream elsewhere.

Once you do find it though, you'll find yourself in a lovely restored space beneath the Kaufman Studios. The room is quite beautiful. Lots of wood, light and pretty decor that will make you feel like you stepped back in time. I expected it to be busier for brunch but there were a few empty tables when we were there. The brunch prix fixe includes an item from their 'eye openers', an entree, coffee and tea, and a mimosa or Bloody Mary. I started with a chocolate croissant with my coffee then I had the lump crab melt and a mimosa. The croissant was delightful and the lump crab melt was delicious! It had avocado and it went perfectly well. Over all I really liked the place. The live jazz wasn't wow worthy but it provided a nice background while my friend and I chatted.

Add pork belly as a topping for 4 bucks- brings the bowl to almost $20.00.  The pork belly was a total let down- WAY too much fat on it, not the melt-in-your-mouth type or delicious flavor at all.  Should have skipped this topping for sure.

I don't plan to rush back to this place.  The food was good, but there are definitely much better places to try that offer better service.",193,0,0,,,0,"No reference.

It was only for a night, so it wasn't so bad, and of course the rate happened to be dirt cheap. When you went to open the door from the hallway, you couldn't, since it banged right into the bed. We actually found this to be funny. You certainly get what you paid for. From the photos here, it looks like they still have those cone-shaped sinks, but I'm happy to say I remember having clean sheets and no issues. It looks like a disaster from the more recent shots. The picture I posted was when they had a huge piece of 'artwork' behind the headboard. I don't believe Paramount is a part of the Morgan's Hotel Group anymore, but of all the hotels within that group at the time, this was my least favorite. But I'm still glad I tried it.

393,998117,2013-08-23,OZexlK3A3IN-6LGz3ywQjw,tabata-ramen-new-york-3,4.0,"I will admit that I'm a fan and customer of the original Tabata at 9th Avenue and when I saw online that Tabata 2 was opening up on 8th Avenue and located even closer to the front entrance of the Port Authority, I couldn't help but to try the place. Tabata just opened a week ago and is located on 8th Avenue between 37th and 38th Streets.   I generally consider the Port Authority area to be a wasteland for good food and having a quality ramen joint close to a major commuter area is wonderfully convenient.  For those who know the original Tabata on Ninth Avenue, here are a few differences: *The dining room is long and narrow, but doesn't seem as wide as the original. There seems to be fewer 4 seat tables, as most of the restaurant is of the one and two seat variety. * The dining room is better lit and uses warm earth toned floors and tiled walls. * In the original Tabata, there are many color signs that show restaurant specialties, such as green noodles, fried chicken wings, and pork sausage, but at the new location, there are only a few such signs. * There are fewer waiters, but there are fewer seats at this location. * The menu is smaller. The original has about 13 types of ramen, but the new one, if my memory is correct has only 8 or 9 choices. In my opinion, these choices are varied enough so that it's not a setback. There is also a decent selection of appetizers, although the choices are fewer than the original. I had the Sutamina Ramen, which is what I consider ""a flavor of all trades"" type of ramen. It's miso, spicy, garlicky and soy all mixed into one broth without one element getting into the way of another. I ordered extra noodles for a few dollars more. The noodles are nicely eggy and chewy, just the way I like ramen.  The porl was sliced thinly and wasn't cha siu style as with many ramen joints. It was thin, tender and moist. I also had the chicken karage (fried chicken) and the fried squid. Both were excellent. I especially liked the dollop of ponzu on minced daikon for the chicken. Both were served on a small bed of salad. Most appetizers were in the $5 to $8 range and most ramen were in the $9 to $10 range. For that price, in a highly trafficked area, you will rarely get a better deal. Finally, the service was excellent and welcoming. It's always nice to see a familiar face in a new neighborhood!",441,0,0,,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

The menu at this location has various special meat lovers set combos that you can order. In my case, I did not have time to do proper yelp! research before going to this place. Very unfortunate. I'd heard nice things about because of its better-than-ground-floor-view (meaning it's on the second floor and it is glass covered). I knew this place did a lot of advertising about their happy hour specials and hoped it would be a good deal. Alas, we barely ate anything at the bar before we got seated so I didn't really get to find out whether they were...and after finishing the meal, i probably will not return to find out more. What we had at the bar: -Ahi Tuna Poke (claimed to be ""#1 best seller"" according to the menu) - it was ok. I was glad it was cold, tasted relatively like what I associate with raw ""tuna"" and came with a little seaweed. At this point, I was a ravenous creature willing to eat anything and this passed the test. It was food. -Kimchi pancakes - also just ok. Ours were a little underdone. I would not reorder this. Then we got seated at our neat table. It was next to the huge windows and most of the seating in the restaurant was booths, which is pretty sweet because they are very spacious and give each party a lot of room - even if there's only two of you! At this point, the server/hostess comes over and turns on the grill which gets very hot and dry, very fast. If you are wearing contact lenses, they may completely dry out in about 3 minutes of the grill heating up - in which case, you should think ahead and arrive prepared with eye drops!

DRINKS -specialty craft cocktails of the night: lipstick fizz (play on the name of the building), old fashioned, prosecco and berries, and a smokey margarita.  All nicely presented and well-blended, the gin-based lipstick fizz was my favorite. ATMOSPHERE -Old school vibe with leather chairs and old wooden stools around the large circular bar. -**OUTDOOR COUCH SEATING - best part by far, because you are not directly on the street, you are set back under the lipstick building, but can enjoy the great weather (and people watching!)

However, soooo so pleasantly surprised.  Very friendly staff and laid-back atmosphere.  Unlimited $10 mimosas are simply awesome! and yes, there was quite a bit more champaign in the glass than orange juice - just how it should be haha.  We all shared french toast bites with home made pear cream cheese and an order of mac-n-cheese balls.  French toast was amazing, delicious, just enough sweetness and so well complimented by the cream cheese (yumminess).  I ordered chicken and waffles in sausage gravy - absolutely loved it! The chicken was done well, not at all dry but moist and crunchy on the outside.  Waffle burger, regular burger, and biscuits with gravy were just as delicious - everybody was so satisfied with their food, they were practically licking their plates clean.  Definitely recommend this place for a nice, quality, laid-back brunch with a nice portion of mimosas :)",179,0,0,,,0,"No reference.

My friend politely explained to her she was wrong and they called security on my friends. It was very embarrassing and unnecessary. In the end, she ended up coming out of pocket an extra $130.

She called management, explained the situation, gave them my card information and told them she had the receipt and here we are 2 weeks later with nothing done.

It wasnt that we looked young that bitch did the elevator look at everybody. Just checking everybody out with a look that oozed superiority that he shouldnt have had. Anyways back to the steakhouse excluding the host. The stteak is definitely worth any bullshit you have to get through to get there which really isnt a lot. It's the most amazing thing i have eaten in my life and trust me i have eaten billions of steak. The dish itself is amazing. Get your steak medium rare and if you have people that like it better cooked you can push your steak on the ridiculously hot dish and cook it a little more. It cooks immediately. You have to get the bacon, its like a cup of cool water in hell. It WILL blow your mind away. The sundae is likewise very good. Thank you to all the people who reviewed for helping me pick what to eat, I ordered like  a pro and the beer was very tasty. The sauce is definitely worth its weight in gold. It is expensive but definitely worth it and if youre in new york, pennsylvania, new jersey, conneticut, california, hawaii.. take a train, a boat, a car or whatever you have to and get your ass to that restaurant. Save whatever you need and try it at least once. Trust me you wont regret it.",244,1,0,thanks you to all the people who reviewed for helping me pick what to eat,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

However if you are making a special trip to eat here, I would say skip it. <br><br>The pizza is good, but not great. It is better than Gramaldis, next door,  larger and better tasting but there are better tasting pizzas all over New York.  I will say that it is a bit overrated  by critics. <br><br>The positives points are that the service was very good, prompt and well organized. The place itself is clean and quaint. One negative however while the pizza comes hot, it cools off quite fast, the air conditioning here is strong.",115,0,0,,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Waitress was super nice and informative about the items on the menu as well as the cocktails. We got the regular bison burger, pretzel and cheese, and kale salad. Burger was perfect! The tots were a little too crispy for me so maybe we should have gone with the fries. Kale salad, on point.",74,0,0,,,0,"No reference.

Nope. Headed right back here for some fast, cheap, and most excellent pizza. Outside of   being a great deal, the thin crust pizza is awesome. I mean under $6 for 2 slices and a can of soda? Perfect. They have other Italian dishes too which I have not tried so can&#39;t speak to them. But I had the chocolate mousse and it was pretty good and the dessert case in general looks mouthwatering. Give it a try. The friendly gentleman waiting in the back to serve you pizza will hook you right up.",123,0,0,,,0,"No reference.

All really flavorful and the portions are very generous. I try to avoid this place on weekends because they get such large groups that a table of 2-4 people can get forgotten and ignored. But once you do get the wait staff's attention they are totally attentive and friendly. The decor is a bit dated but still the food is good enough to overlook stuff like ambiance here.",107,0,0,,,0,"No reference.

Before quarantine I would always go to Raw Bar as well, which is owned by DOMODOMO.<br><br>The outdoor dining area was beautiful and you can tell it was a custom built and designed patio, great to see DOMODOMO back in action.<br><br>My friends and I ordered the DOMOKASE, which is DOMODOMO&#39;s unique spin on Omakase. It&#39;s more like a set meal, since they don&#39;t bring the pieces of sushi out one by one like Omakase, however, everything is very high quality and you get a variety of tastings throughout the course.<br><br>Perfect spot to catch up with some friends or for date night as well.

It must have taken me less that 20 minutes to order and get my pizza. I got a slice of the Spicy Spring which is a square pepperoni, and the Fancy Spring which is a Margherita slice. The Spicy Spring was great. Lots of cheese, great crust and lots of flavor. The Margherita was good. Not too exciting but definitely a good choice for Vegetarians.<br><br>You can eat your pizza there. You can look at the pics of all the famous people (lots of male athletes) who&#39;ve eaten there while you&#39;re enjoying your slices.<br><br>I was amazed that I was able to get a meal for $11 in New York City.

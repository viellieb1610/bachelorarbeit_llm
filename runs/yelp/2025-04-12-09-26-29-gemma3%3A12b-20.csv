0,764112,2012-11-03,BpPfor4USyvpxTvROQ7LlA,amura-japanese-new-york,5.0,Tried take out since this is only 5 star sushi nearby on yelp so I was interested. Definitely good sushi and fresh so no complaints and had to join in with the other 5 star raters. Have some unique roll options that help it stand out from some other sushi places nearby.,52,1,1,,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

High Street&#39;s bread is so fresh and homemade, it truly sets them apart and takes the meal up a notch. I would very rarely pay $4 for a bread selection, but it&#39;s definitely worth it there. <br><br>I&#39;ve been a few times now, but keep gravitating back to the pastrami sandwich if I go for lunch. The rye bread is delicious and the pastrami is right up there with Katz&#39;s. If you&#39;re there for lunch and brought an appetite, I highly recommend. <br><br>Egg dishes are also fantastic too. Great portions and execution. Just an overall 10/10 experience every time there.",117,0,0,,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

For what I paid (~$10), the meat was dry and the fries were very average. The hot sauce wasn't even moderately spicy, which didn't help things at all. The veggies were decent though.

6,2374404,2016-07-29,ORUSfeLmO-l8M9kjmyqjng,alta-linea-new-york,5.0,Great outdoor seating and standing area outside the hotel. Nice vibe. Came with a group of friends just for a drink. Somebody heard the frozen negroni was supposed to be really good. I got it and it definitely did not disappoint. I have to say though that it doesn't taste like a normal negroni and it's a more sweet than bitter. The frozen lemon drink was also good.

I think my roommates may punch me for only giving them 4 stars, but I just can't justify giving them 5 stars with the wait time + the prices. This pizza is truly superb and absolutely delicious. The hostess didn't have much in the way of a positive attitude, but our servers were wonderful. We put our names in around 6pm and were told to come back at 10. We did, and ended up waiting another half hour before being seated. We ordered two pizzas--one with mushrooms, half pepper and half pepperoni, and the other was a basic margarita with shallots. The total for that? $58. With tip, I think we ended up spending about $70. Two pizzas at $29 each. I'm going to let that sink in. It's a lot! I think they put an entire basil plant on each pizza, but I had no complaints. Basically, was the pizza amazing? Yes. I'd say it's on par with the best I've had, but good lord--that wait? I don't think it justified a 4+ hour wait. I waited for 2 hours for Battersby on a weekend, and that was worth it. To wait twice as long, this would have to be, comparatively, twice as good. It wasn't. I'd go back, though...on a weekday!",223,0,0,,,1,"Reference to other reviews.

Everything was delicious, portions were a good size and our guests were raving. I was charged a $20 per bottle cork fee, but that worked out well bc I brought in 3 bottles of wine, and the cheapest bottle on their menu was $40...and also a $3 per person cake fee.

The restaurant itself has a great vibe and Mediterranean decor with lovely music. Although the music can sometimes overpower the dinner table conversation, you can overlook it because the food will keep your mouth busy. One of my favorites is their burgers, which they cook at a perfect medium rare- at your request. Among others I'd definitely try out their daily specials, I've had a few and they're all delectable. The fish and seafood are all very fresh tasting and well seasoned. Their lemon potatoes are also a must try! For authentic Greek food this is the place to go!",123,0,0,,,0,"No reference.

The venue is beautiful, and it's nice to have a place to go in the neighborhood where you can get a drink and watch a game. Service was pretty good, and they have a decent selection of drinks. I had the mushroom burger. The burger portion was pretty dry but whatever they marinate the mushrooms in was amazing!
